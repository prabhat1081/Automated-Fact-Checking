1.0	0.56387495968	The truth of the matter is, net immigration from Mexico last year was zero.
0.0	0.415863821716	We have people that aren't working.
0.0	0.485516308095	To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.
0.0	0.448082898014	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.265534566563	There's never going do be perfect bill.
0.0	0.211559556678	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
0.0	0.410760512013	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.29287024384	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.314056605501	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.231496286993	Excuse me.

0.0	0.551586105783	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.305383520857	So that it will not be a federal crime.
0.0	0.308685362301	We did a lot to help.

0.0	0.270528835864	Think about that.
0.0	0.26871751143	I believe that the goal should be debt-free college.

0.0	0.281416289733	Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire.

0.0	0.707343314771	I believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation.
0.0	0.283953497131	Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home.
0.0	0.231715460018	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.245422872066	No, you weren't.
0.0	0.35286105693	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.334889522113	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.

0.0	0.246862072421	Well, I respectfully disagree.

0.0	0.297102289268	It never happens.
0.0	0.321606480834	And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity.
0.0	0.269374793919	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
0.0	0.601242239007	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.
0.0	0.556731115506	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.339664939897	You have a bigger problem with China.
0.0	0.357033834137	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.477369155748	They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).
0.0	0.298478099298	They can't lead us.

0.0	0.384575372373	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.272359301768	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.543875206253	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?

0.0	0.230529149575	We say "we're gonna protect."
0.0	0.701450354665	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.711841838144	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.551907623207	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.540231229877	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.266075918891	OK.
0.0	0.315455501694	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.256914998682	No, I think they won't.
0.0	0.25605454436	Creativity.
0.0	0.544756174967	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.656308680615	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.690571572264	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.540054780882	We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York.
0.0	0.290427537284	I agree completely.
0.0	0.526863872526	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.553252086855	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.524812252043	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.581507791717	I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism --
0.0	0.289095353165	They want American troops back in the Middle East.
0.0	0.601541820934	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.629645344916	When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.
0.0	0.525508345163	And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave.
0.0	0.328783459366	We also have to build a coalition at home.
0.0	0.426038876818	Do it.
0.0	0.410764872496	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.346071895869	So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.
0.0	0.553556772808	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.291253256849	Our country has tremendous potential.
0.0	0.257601701148	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.356733003581	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.288432735179	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.284691777744	I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.
0.0	0.608893419945	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
0.0	0.340051472698	The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.
0.0	0.490343061952	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.282242814957	I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.
0.0	0.293949918278	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.22773655389	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.664243806283	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.51935294567	Secondly, we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.
0.0	0.440558373711	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.245162772861	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.400041343403	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.437901655508	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.269690894892	Chris...
0.0	0.26243304779	Good evening.
0.0	0.68945684136	So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there.
0.0	0.71007307943	Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes.
0.0	0.295727912368	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.566932593903	Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging.
0.0	0.570851143311	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.723967709825	And so, look, the way that -- a stronger middle class is actually the source of economic growth.
0.0	0.268179691547	Look at my family.
0.0	0.426662739088	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.456880817698	We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground."
0.0	0.533607454713	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.673020188252	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.58418882484	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
0.0	0.263167728923	We have people that don't have it.
0.0	0.26822241636	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.231270465083	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.256447065921	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.5	Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.
0.0	0.719246164602	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.383027808905	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
1.0	0.429014988671	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.375263152293	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.245929950764	Here's what I believe.
0.0	0.259833192361	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.689085781667	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.293349111149	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.5	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.373513840889	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.307611465348	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.450209627248	Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting...
0.0	0.321091946702	But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says.
0.0	0.343163910114	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.2845340333	We have a stock market that is so bloated.
0.0	0.230449312281	That's what we believe in.
0.0	0.388410966357	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
0.0	0.272226308136	That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.
0.0	0.283109297266	I was for legalization.
0.0	0.357497715543	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.
0.0	0.695962916161	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
0.0	0.57701800352	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
0.0	0.300871394637	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.38027009125	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.302719097418	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.630006216712	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.261723181322	I'd suggest people take a look at it.
0.0	0.225446051156	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.322804832873	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.545118099052	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.31435172373	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.239870431714	That's a drag on the economy.
0.0	0.264476861668	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.239776893978	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.359512629138	That's not even an issue.
1.0	0.355077025199	They were wrong.
1.0	0.727749578358	We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.701379561425	And that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity -- kill people who are unarmed who should not be killed, they must be held accountable.
0.0	0.722731343056	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.488381451238	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.710449398288	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.517707872146	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.382122592102	We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?
0.0	0.307723784015	Our president doesn't have a clue.
0.0	0.245164899087	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.364444461633	You can go to my website...
1.0	0.751005498406	In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.
0.0	0.427331711855	It's a divided country on guns.
0.0	0.525456251099	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.345428257298	... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record.
0.0	0.308988110857	... issues they have to respond to.
0.0	0.300005210245	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.683009842474	At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida.
0.0	0.691954295855	Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.
0.0	0.557579444016	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.511547675904	But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said.
0.0	0.591932111615	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.265351284311	Believe me, folks.
0.0	0.542913816421	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.597000668906	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.699025837664	But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama.

0.0	0.402701650987	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.482632180754	We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.
0.0	0.577164064599	I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.
0.0	0.351456250716	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.60153695803	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.419557704639	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
0.0	0.303740675353	I don't think a halt is necessary.

0.0	0.690515693525	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.261990773938	And we have nothing.
0.0	0.544131708214	They say, " well, we don't really have control."

0.0	0.353486819351	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.265893155615	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.387218747203	And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country.
0.0	0.673906537847	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
0.0	0.261634640972	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.541186056066	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.310194738081	... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.626819929855	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.250169047172	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
0.0	0.539699705769	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.231887928246	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.
0.0	0.259328946422	Yes.
0.0	0.435837057858	The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans.
0.0	0.280550164818	We have nothing.
0.0	0.247096649807	She did it for convenience.
0.0	0.616155091988	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.512809692003	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.38203082378	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.341543083695	Well, I've got news for you, we can.
0.0	0.269690894892	Chris?
0.0	0.435961323374	Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.
0.0	0.311569297019	Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
0.0	0.454195639384	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
0.0	0.279972053877	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.288198798965	Two points.
0.0	0.432377817258	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.234703480564	So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
0.0	0.287458379736	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.303912781358	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.281887342152	A step forward.
0.0	0.600911979124	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.
0.0	0.278381955877	He thinks low wages are a good idea.
0.0	0.342978295281	If we are not successful, if we continue the same old, same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big-money interests, nothing changes.
0.0	0.277526187763	And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.
0.0	0.42527796756	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.295565928243	Rebuild the country's infrastructure.
0.0	0.280290981282	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.729015617046	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.403421671633	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
1.0	0.328851771051	They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us.
0.0	0.28063692258	You can go to opensecrets.org and check that.
0.0	0.253187185743	All right.
0.0	0.289372997086	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.288326343087	Just for the record.
0.0	0.462880406711	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.48395482369	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.701186709973	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.

0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.418609782234	We will see what the American people are willing to support.
0.0	0.265625071872	Let me just say this...
0.0	0.448309534019	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
1.0	0.672556167493	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.51299432115	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.298682591045	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.36716066672	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
1.0	0.402187131711	We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.
0.0	0.67176452409	I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan.
0.0	0.568094308222	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.315949766837	And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.
0.0	0.591109364302	Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system.
0.0	0.39867569913	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.610331423189	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.259328946422	Yes.
0.0	0.649120846085	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.28557081289	Just can't happen.
0.0	0.314481434025	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.614976258608	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.566154176873	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.329871004793	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.670178593952	How do we do it?"
0.0	0.356752880952	She is not qualified to be President of the United States.
0.0	0.287655172998	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
0.0	0.565278368407	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.286382066678	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.691267039952	And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.
0.0	0.719935688469	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.
0.0	0.264100819293	I am glad Donald is running.
0.0	0.346227082407	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.

0.0	0.276614709319	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.389134593724	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.585410559701	Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple.
0.0	0.265395786169	I don't want it."
0.0	0.312938688595	And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.
0.0	0.295172271282	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.589273941192	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.282349566748	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.2782532483	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.248263159798	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.421974051156	I -- I believe that we should make community college free.
0.0	0.318482783773	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.265868956787	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.369052924218	... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...
1.0	0.697228797801	I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians.
0.0	0.709201222003	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.266075918891	OK...
0.0	0.562016524516	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.271461053721	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.482687566851	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.726185821367	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.304499059015	That means everything.
0.0	0.464917473172	We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
0.0	0.646362721904	If the United States does not lead, there is not another leader.
0.0	0.289698157342	But it's a lot safer.

0.0	0.296453799032	Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that's not good enough.
0.0	0.654529969283	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.

0.0	0.68127628065	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.244780544097	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.334487364619	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.711329042145	And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to.
0.0	0.272264236763	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.578581246494	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.697457727087	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.248495785781	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.291262809559	The biggest bank in the world is from China.
0.0	0.281102427106	What part is valid?
0.0	0.557030034027	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.332971946129	I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.526433357807	Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.

0.0	0.397380675856	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.270101374157	I've faced it.
0.0	0.671400416385	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.688203903208	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.246814762169	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.253187185743	All right.
0.0	0.581240897735	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.271122932443	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.309650797487	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.303844818005	Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.
0.0	0.160592874829	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.273538255673	It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.
0.0	0.529389745769	I spent a lot of time in the situation room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us.
0.0	0.490055290493	We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.
0.0	0.231461456863	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.519005959502	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
0.0	0.539333561762	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.434326647153	We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
0.0	0.2450936229	That was a terrible mistake.
0.0	0.361424357775	They are not doing it now.
0.0	0.59212585282	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.210713515422	And I think this is an important question.
0.0	0.643113153467	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.277750113317	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.553039555031	So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.
0.0	0.334617970982	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.580832124697	Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.
0.0	0.51012584422	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.274230075284	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.490775468783	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.657470698	Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.
0.0	0.288653053615	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.705936992489	We're spending over $600 billion a year on the military and yet, significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism.
0.0	0.588213550041	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.578509202306	But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks.
0.0	0.360123639086	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.320013632759	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.216614874161	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.711075037252	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.306557278994	Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth.
0.0	0.304550774373	$24 trillion.
0.0	0.256557460426	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.556585152089	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.27776993443	in particular.
0.0	0.713778880561	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.360669030341	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.603142303528	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.385087764117	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.312801757726	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.409923396746	He'll say, "Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico."
0.0	0.669862634421	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
1.0	0.799645523854	The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation.
0.0	0.258285822294	Everybody's for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.273313991625	How stupid are they?
0.0	0.231496286993	Excuse me.
0.0	0.372405757831	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.38578208463	How are they going to beat ISIS?
0.0	0.236124943753	And I believe he is absolutely right.
0.0	0.687303272829	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
0.0	0.261954519867	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.414933862988	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.530533790259	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
0.0	0.457640511412	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.614513286118	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.589202148646	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
0.0	0.336058597287	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.361919061015	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.262613170352	They had a plan that was good.
0.0	0.547459534075	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.705440510983	States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government.
1.0	0.717515397414	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.405166680862	We need to have stronger families.
1.0	0.712696172881	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.543264949164	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.577133127778	We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress, but it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us.
0.0	0.626196314926	You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
0.0	0.256072930835	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.541186056066	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.535813730635	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.304080385372	It feels different.
0.0	0.476492508978	We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
0.0	0.259022640409	He's not a leader.
0.0	0.713121097429	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.340001416826	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.
0.0	0.398563443743	It's not just Wall Street.
0.0	0.435660613114	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.39254115071	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.6261559829	Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks -- between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance.
0.0	0.15215695679	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.30272818641	And then on top of that, we've got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are pouring huge sums of money into super PACS heavily influencing the political process.
0.0	0.5	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.290711271902	I do not believe in unilateral American action.
0.0	0.5	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.690758264664	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.469727829774	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.575018625997	One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together.
0.0	0.518655351583	You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911.
0.0	0.252283263222	I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.
0.0	0.606730218448	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.
0.0	0.637221032703	And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.
0.0	0.565677345042	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.634205776717	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.245155379312	How do I know this?
0.0	0.704274300651	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.306180373757	Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.
0.0	0.262577962206	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.312295287921	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.448554342597	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.259328946422	Yes.
0.0	0.522412942866	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.682226690772	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.262396549014	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.257603867155	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.584836788154	And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.
0.0	0.343529484671	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.253607915639	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.668495428922	There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan.
0.0	0.672081886951	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.279209761939	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.559411171174	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
1.0	0.300495969751	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.673394335119	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.287980517817	White people?
0.0	0.673154590932	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.667512285747	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.298024623455	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.273201475901	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.723241660612	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.453495904929	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.413516244636	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.134985154734	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.27373967714	I think we all support it.
0.0	0.361403215521	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.68360901177	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.270259772639	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.695939354062	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.60272151086	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.
0.0	0.271337118056	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.688966890527	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.584705252929	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.272425605141	They started in Iowa.
0.0	0.70126930015	I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
0.0	0.580990969511	If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.
0.0	0.697438900744	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.
0.0	0.625468281084	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.

0.0	0.644576829481	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.372967007596	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.

0.0	0.560849357428	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.715497317959	At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically.
1.0	0.384861321012	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.557034132389	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.707886383052	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.401961098165	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.687828666404	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.439258878585	That is the clear and present danger.
0.0	0.633995576281	If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W.

0.0	0.273459483826	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.5	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.45536982637	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.
0.0	0.363969071669	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.599960166123	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.

0.0	0.707035529633	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.

0.0	0.265625071872	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.315670644088	And it has three parts.

0.0	0.322233641481	Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.
0.0	0.400514144371	I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination.
0.0	0.583719337011	From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made.
0.0	0.332579967975	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.573397423327	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.313568173302	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.273745019812	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.

0.0	0.5	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.

0.0	0.45354813628	Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.
0.0	0.329614398488	If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country.

0.0	0.256042736177	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.700429857086	It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English.
0.0	0.401087503886	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.589259558373	So I believe that, in fact, this country needs to move towards a living wage.

0.0	0.268202114865	We need that thinking.
1.0	0.245941795592	We passed it after 9/11.
0.0	0.602188206748	And he also had no trouble appointing an investment banker to be in charge of his consumer protection bureau when he was governor.
0.0	0.486712853673	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.27738980111	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.417834688491	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.245092568163	We did our own rallies.

0.0	0.584167268716	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.556731115502	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.586638563136	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.
0.0	0.261253254185	They don't like that.

0.0	0.717076391562	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.554596357059	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.281323844794	Check it out.
0.0	0.241210309425	You're certainly not very good.
0.0	0.296799536819	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.689809806281	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.229174531967	And who's compromised and who is principled.
0.0	0.51745468087	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
1.0	0.673347778272	But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.
0.0	0.378970718676	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.
0.0	0.363286270906	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.600857711842	Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe.
0.0	0.353969182644	Lehman Brothers was not a big bank.
0.0	0.541203544543	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.633978994854	Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.295051033455	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.333458171919	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.306429736242	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.67820864616	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.599991851048	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
0.0	0.625479562742	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.384273808643	In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.714347482324	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.5586672252	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.616165594036	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.277584173518	No.
0.0	0.314355568229	You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?
0.0	0.395655463268	Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice.
0.0	0.542713494998	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.717962695339	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.670310022147	How does that help us?  TRUMP R 15 94 1 N Where is that good?

0.0	0.507774018918	I do and this is an important issue and I know we'll get to a lot of other critical ones as well.

0.0	0.278450205406	She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.268195297233	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.297459503637	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.578878719813	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.41952606957	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...
0.0	0.292803705807	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.259469349814	The Secretary's obviously right.
0.0	0.274270383962	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.255872777264	But I would add this.
0.0	0.353976964745	... and say there is something more important than money.
0.0	0.334306556652	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.308447493562	Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC.

0.0	0.22783971412	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.264048470612	So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
0.0	0.283222512514	But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue -- requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.278879573234	That's not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.
0.0	0.489602047941	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.644429114589	That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.
0.0	0.518716676754	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.25589545961	I'm going to be independent.

0.0	0.239264023596	And a lot of people are doing that.
0.0	0.722378600407	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.274149393292	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.276851920347	Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
0.0	0.605954709257	And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young, old, everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard.
0.0	0.558833698211	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.269955762299	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.431819302762	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.699620393276	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.218919769183	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.259385433411	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.425997939748	All of you in Iowa, I need you to caucus for me.
0.0	0.352736184382	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.265659616898	But he wasn't a cheerleader.
0.0	0.268161516218	That's my view.
0.0	0.22791975232	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.566655259634	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.289752117824	We're rebuilding many countries.
0.0	0.580417959318	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.269304555434	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.207802863155	But, here is the truth.

0.0	0.262462868589	They have no choice.
0.0	0.537684821732	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.433141905288	And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you're a governor.
0.0	0.699543743456	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.289064991605	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.283794762336	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.257447383919	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.3304691409	That is our government today.
0.0	0.653567543368	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.5	What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security, through the State Department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening.
0.0	0.656697114226	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.298292410154	... Chris, keep it coming...
0.0	0.426180132564	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.299223353131	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.702792069932	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.468712191417	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.254025415053	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.69404770975	We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up.
0.0	0.274313013998	We don't win.
0.0	0.264480405369	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.280632180569	And I have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run.
0.0	0.295920319218	Look, the secretary is right.
0.0	0.677901598035	Some of the bravest people that I had the privilege of working with as secretary of state were our development professionals who went sometimes alone, sometimes with our military, into very dangerous places in Iraq, in Afghanistan, elsewhere.
0.0	0.578714755194	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.277584173518	Again...
0.0	0.676184783464	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.
0.0	0.69367262743	In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...
0.0	0.246689145197	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.690267234418	Well, you know, governor, I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010.
0.0	0.675794922962	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.481793609358	It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them.
0.0	0.600174195644	Well, I'm kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time.
0.0	0.493953789158	Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day.

0.0	0.290295103549	When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.426038876818	And why?
0.0	0.282308459201	...income tax...
0.0	0.663119810348	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.705013538615	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.293641706263	But -- but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages.
1.0	0.769788720546	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.675465683155	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.718603142392	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.583322169917	Since, you know, the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody.
0.0	0.30334161794	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.51397992149	And all over New Hampshire, I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose.
0.0	0.308860444609	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.26543420403	I have formed them.
0.0	0.727749516139	Reinstating Glass- Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough.
0.0	0.581512490383	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.5	Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.
0.0	0.282319194536	Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.
0.0	0.537915701008	We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate.
0.0	0.275457718218	OK, good.
0.0	0.505004648942	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.606040679857	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.668989970173	In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.
0.0	0.588894146116	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.346196479566	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.72817021117	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.512796460217	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.588730628543	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.701167092193	It wasn't the bill that I wanted, but yet it turned out to be one of the more significant pieces of veterans' legislation passed in recent history.
0.0	0.510549789769	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.314876080836	And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.
0.0	0.335333405963	All the time.
0.0	0.486053635214	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.285521379144	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.5	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.241129100064	Ever.
0.0	0.26902658593	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.598305635163	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.247149523522	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.268984143453	My name was invoked.
0.0	0.26827075032	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.266085968544	Megyn, that's the problem.
0.0	0.252511942593	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.338475349093	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.572157467475	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.631192567284	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.263097114541	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.345779984009	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.65359678174	And, I would not that there's a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that's the EPA's blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline.
0.0	0.57291234682	We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001.
0.0	0.3465346888	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.668925567561	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.
0.0	0.268919569599	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.375303538701	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
1.0	0.71837555777	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.267026968902	It's not working.
0.0	0.329121134033	Can we stop?
0.0	0.5	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.344448372284	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.512913366892	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.407706618015	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.5	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.600728201974	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.332301782374	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.671041432275	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.
0.0	0.277775780286	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.34069247337	I would like to see it updated.
0.0	0.277584173518	No.
0.0	0.558250156326	My wife, Jane, has been -- way back when before I knew her, a foster parent.
0.0	0.43316596508	You know, we had this incident before, Secretary, with your famous e-mails.
0.0	0.53453347036	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.581937824464	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.247008506968	It's not great again.
0.0	0.245201776661	And that's not what's happening now.
0.0	0.669921189167	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.712342053612	We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.
0.0	0.659354429365	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.
0.0	0.242702617266	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.308969877585	I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.
1.0	0.274531846235	They're rapists.
0.0	0.277759084966	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.245888949672	He was a great negotiator.
0.0	0.396381875689	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.306278181466	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.588811163452	I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.
0.0	0.681988354765	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.428133492079	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.562223277297	And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years.
0.0	0.467543638297	This nation is the most powerful military in the world.
0.0	0.348107154778	Many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed.
0.0	0.558486851681	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.318910688868	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.533275456654	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.27718809912	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.549388446914	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.311922022968	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.545825597157	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.533446238451	You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet...
0.0	0.287763495869	We can't.
0.0	0.250188160615	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.213634678663	And that is what we have done in Ohio.
0.0	0.296799536819	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.37511927873	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.249522357405	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.30423236062	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.329854370685	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.723162914835	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.269497737847	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.249118434363	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.288738786148	From top to bottom.
0.0	0.415736954595	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.645299127387	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
0.0	0.333930352205	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.65425551858	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.245413998535	It's not about Donald Trump.
0.0	0.542711150005	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.237418863044	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.319533603749	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.290482272797	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.267147329186	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.707710987575	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.331696215032	He said, "You know, I make great product."
0.0	0.39275646352	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.633499155452	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.432958999244	So I said, "That's OK." I'm proud of my net worth.
0.0	0.527314495773	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.386131720284	No interest," because I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.257253840262	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.446557716498	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
0.0	0.147400773603	And it has been amazing to me.
0.0	0.39738247292	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.518561633546	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.395265706575	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
0.0	0.245384132352	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.247996048479	I know that because I buy the product."

0.0	0.262329468547	They all want me to support them.
0.0	0.378619069261	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
1.0	0.715159575566	We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.
0.0	0.453970163471	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.
0.0	0.563147302512	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.653669848817	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.226010046374	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.541093320949	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.322108463298	It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.
0.0	0.390894416931	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.338542085493	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.245422872066	Don't do it."
0.0	0.38179722257	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.275420944172	I'm ready.
0.0	0.282040295027	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.283492861791	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.60142109018	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.599175898298	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.3431714521	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.638326385495	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.566716983769	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.265231137387	Let me say this.
0.0	0.47551188075	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.
0.0	0.556731115502	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.613177133838	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.20910671248	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.710969973346	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.713421820702	Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it.
0.0	0.28012320443	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.357964863172	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.275383267703	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.335851586994	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.58578126545	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.643469551687	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.315352690586	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.426296643952	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.471232612401	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.61460492818	The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress.
0.0	0.651703757036	So I've said, if the big banks don't play by the rules, I will break them up.
0.0	0.723908870235	Paul Volcker, one of the leading lights of trying to reign in the excesses, has also said he does not support reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.266075918891	OK.
0.0	0.44572238423	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.459799497287	And it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer.
0.0	0.51615136944	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.694746607433	It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.
0.0	0.467585811425	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.277584173518	2,000?
0.0	0.521345179391	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.335913577285	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.690608488109	And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.
0.0	0.722464575377	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.562808141381	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.267859684397	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.2793580899	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.596720940182	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.585096943983	The Libyans turned out for one of the most successful, fairest elections that any Arab country has had.
0.0	0.285094024478	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.286737868776	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.60007290116	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.323446474329	Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.
0.0	0.257117951726	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.274716285502	Enough said.
0.0	0.3399843603	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.639649448658	First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster.
0.0	0.431323529712	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.246077293036	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.277578986518	...
0.0	0.548392289763	You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent.
0.0	0.481873774895	We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be -- and -- and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody.
0.0	0.646514633077	We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it.
0.0	0.624248704544	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.507583076676	We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression.
0.0	0.724739277693	And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.
0.0	0.352916449176	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.347838702939	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.243791000746	Obama is going to be out playing golf.
0.0	0.699555350752	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.366922701168	They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
0.0	0.274635183245	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.567464212415	We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.
0.0	0.282239200483	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.560937615233	The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.
0.0	0.372867336511	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.664603745367	Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region.
0.0	0.268717986801	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
1.0	0.285481638582	We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
0.0	0.352365925365	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.356915334882	I think it's important we put this in historic context.
0.0	0.425904124044	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.724060886642	But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.
0.0	0.669669843759	You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future.
0.0	0.275280851616	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.267235751153	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.368437036203	So there's more to my plan than just the cap.
0.0	0.568445654472	In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill, "Well I assume Hillary has told you about this."
0.0	0.249045633863	Nobody.
0.0	0.720620440887	Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground.
0.0	0.266075918891	OK?
0.0	0.438403534337	And the world, no doubt is a better place without him.
0.0	0.291586364504	I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.
0.0	0.392373273838	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
0.0	0.372352191252	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.229016219634	But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up.
0.0	0.382342030427	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.566645605989	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.685616613207	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.513830313042	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.519541919531	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.537219467731	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.644970032419	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.663984490665	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.347077783931	Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk.
0.0	0.688144363724	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.581816942959	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.541795862733	It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
0.0	0.532872402612	All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee.
0.0	0.277522059267	Because we need money.
0.0	0.278714354884	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.259328946422	Yes.
1.0	0.400854579722	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.522535694117	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.
0.0	0.462522366702	We have got to come forward with a consensus that in fact will work.
0.0	0.585861566597	They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.402302550101	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.262339052697	I've done it.
0.0	0.5	and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States.
0.0	0.566306793631	Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process.
0.0	0.234699131002	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.479007331272	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.352939539102	We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.
0.0	0.278442337886	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.389044465513	ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.
0.0	0.277578986518	...
0.0	0.375924924261	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.309623512796	Well, I got it for two reasons.
0.0	0.471404839089	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.271941881433	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.599987444425	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.289100268395	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.618498706809	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.695584853422	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.315538715881	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.650644544293	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.256011462866	I think any parent would be so proud of them.
0.0	0.349468293125	In fact, American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the National Institute of Health and that we then tested through the FDA.
0.0	0.328064233487	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.446767507291	And now many of these candidates want to cut it.
0.0	0.314804042372	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.277578986518	...
0.0	0.259621379992	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.393540773614	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.369604082159	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.698476901111	They don't want to raise the minimum wage, they don't want to do anything to increase incomes.
0.0	0.530458484365	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.476965470362	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
0.0	0.404636194771	When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
0.0	0.693949330432	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.443278123917	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.701101971517	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.471192234749	I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible.
0.0	0.296514987389	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.72144045317	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.
0.0	0.337297794695	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.284928649736	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.263655319516	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.256647022556	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.601691392994	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.32331586458	But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.60048056507	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.
0.0	0.259767021881	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.376677875702	I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
0.0	0.257592357874	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.343258918053	$5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.653994258247	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.254661587891	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.254289122915	John, I would disagree with Secretary Clinton respectfully on this score.
0.0	0.306368784225	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.53032447402	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.686381361453	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.545615783143	And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.662716155626	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.404268838877	Find out what I said to Greenspan.
1.0	0.642845646147	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.247045338061	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.411054246518	So the fact is that we work for the people.
0.0	0.35587078939	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.269702260009	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.691454761959	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.
0.0	0.540365710509	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.701962731149	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.428517268586	I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart.
0.0	0.402135397412	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.72049062779	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.408346640162	And look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that.
0.0	0.579447329397	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.

0.0	0.272345033483	Of course.

0.0	0.255106142691	There are a lot of factors involved in that.
0.0	0.293979911381	They know we will be committed to victory.

0.0	0.274833467849	John, I think somewhere between...
0.0	0.279262201962	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.27620113021	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
1.0	0.738877642619	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.710606583049	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.720517848622	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.304864019063	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.349473681035	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.

0.0	0.250550357719	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.668418059555	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.637091762207	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.694201435537	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.52530012088	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.395676154429	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.203708845103	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.562066736949	All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.

0.0	0.371991985927	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.645115118754	So I believe that over the next few years, not tomorrow, but over the next few years, we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour.
1.0	0.669299618313	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.469792198906	The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.
0.0	0.295985616389	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.231722853745	...Chris...
0.0	0.588845636357	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.293576906365	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.689709653243	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.307506641504	... Well, no, no.
0.0	0.69420471963	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.261706911415	We all understand that.
0.0	0.719691413711	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.61641614724	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
1.0	0.432985613546	$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work.
1.0	0.54921373284	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.292745469652	Those are all really positive developments.
0.0	0.388212505378	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.337784531056	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.352246566258	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.475792880529	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.27970611973	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.
0.0	0.443443360671	Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization called ISIS.
0.0	0.303319411176	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.294713983518	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.308763738921	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.285453721082	Yeah.
1.0	0.485132348936	2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.
0.0	0.273590112692	I will not do that.
0.0	0.28502563336	So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.
1.0	0.754063110237	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.484332668658	I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s.
0.0	0.5	I also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees.
0.0	0.268049677918	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.316914777797	Fact check me.
0.0	0.684261973222	A lot of the rights that have been won over years, from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights, will be at risk.
1.0	0.665054094062	In 1988, I lost an election because I said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of America.
0.0	0.328992984099	You just can't do it.
0.0	0.240413701176	I said, "how's it going?"
0.0	0.640273895606	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.477497639515	And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.
0.0	0.520356658503	And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending.
0.0	0.267044700648	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.457055933246	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.402234477048	By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa.
0.0	0.256675864865	slot.
0.0	0.510484856846	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.239559317991	I win.
0.0	0.26909917349	Thank you, good night and may the force be with you.
0.0	0.287501175726	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.
0.0	0.631417897175	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.443812452818	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.659197062803	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.285154943491	I kind of miss Donald Trump.
0.0	0.262522562779	And you know what?
1.0	0.556657687075	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.621933855156	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.444597108344	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.271924644044	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.353975124437	This will end.
0.0	0.274856723317	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.693184534645	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
0.0	0.339822054342	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.521200193236	Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength.
1.0	0.515843055081	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.567728027038	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.712915175181	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.456615563863	And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?
0.0	0.597378681365	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.484719250686	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.444537922967	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.259328946422	Yes.
0.0	0.457938740389	Our staff found information on our computers from the Clinton campaign.
0.0	0.247835296095	I don't have to brag.
0.0	0.582308374401	For over 200 years, America's light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again.
0.0	0.351492042699	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.377889181814	Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.
0.0	0.540322404223	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.
0.0	0.555719898156	When you ran in 2000, you said that we needed federal robust regulations.
0.0	0.24671953835	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.383799109306	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.462584913433	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.535407118477	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.468492532084	I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
0.0	0.62883469454	I'm running for president, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people.
0.0	0.277584173518	And...
0.0	0.604222665285	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.336803583942	Well, I'll tell you who is on my side.
0.0	0.362407553344	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.558709434772	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.213033829756	And that's what's happening.
0.0	0.608496019055	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.360532275868	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.427130073681	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
1.0	0.665029556564	Well, John, look, I think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis to leave by 2011, is that an Iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend Iraq.
0.0	0.285432801199	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.718980137358	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.245559529543	Dynamically.
0.0	0.375240045145	He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments.
0.0	0.268937983517	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.

0.0	0.595088070485	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.

0.0	0.34762072217	Quite likely, for that reason.

0.0	0.400211893459	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
0.0	0.315236709626	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.461410042605	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.

0.0	0.273365692607	We have tremendous people.
0.0	0.720501121644	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.56781523912	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.
0.0	0.252761974585	So I don't think...

0.0	0.237846807585	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.269739359711	But we came together.
0.0	0.266075918891	OK?
0.0	0.24566692404	I have a wonderful family.
0.0	0.356505762413	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?
0.0	0.445939579909	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
1.0	0.288384039617	However, what Alan Krueger said in the piece you're referring to is that if we went to $15, there are no international comparisons.
0.0	0.590654084802	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.397603709938	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.549784151805	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.691386575882	But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding.
0.0	0.309942267842	... and 85 percent of gun owners agree.
0.0	0.322059116728	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.273635584784	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.44643533818	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.574882983816	They will not bring us -- believe me -- to the promised land.
0.0	0.666262960721	I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war.
0.0	0.289469556068	That will change everything.
0.0	0.294063860931	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.553087444764	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.361428036569	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.253365988912	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.686854782039	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.368592683802	And so do I.
0.0	0.231685265012	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.274761037615	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.268813296367	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.26415500039	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.284857997179	We will be there soon.
0.0	0.195604759341	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.702823338615	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.343926039235	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.262054231718	Wow.
0.0	0.238509193086	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.481077255471	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.
0.0	0.312236854325	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.295269522612	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.262435505967	Big difference.
0.0	0.611202795861	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.275942793996	I never said that.
0.0	0.243565017706	Right.
0.0	0.192304330941	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.660526811947	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.567967397266	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.367147397072	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.
0.0	0.274877523248	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.270527746056	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.5	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.418229624938	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.705779973704	And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
0.0	0.700011060043	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
0.0	0.689090908984	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.2609385391	Do the $12 and you would index it.
0.0	0.444944494639	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.321018617482	You are not our adversary, you are our partner.
0.0	0.413656548761	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.490844417627	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.199097904589	We've got to hate the Muslims."
0.0	0.28191791366	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.562874746331	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.452248531347	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.331109309991	They're not supporting our law enforcement officers, it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.332707692522	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.676175353122	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.278441617495	You have to lead.
0.0	0.266075918891	OK.
0.0	0.419111456824	We reduced violent crime to 30-year lows.
0.0	0.47672958943	Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
0.0	0.347409236852	I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
0.0	0.365005093091	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
0.0	0.437859168073	I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
0.0	0.397915110744	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
0.0	0.571881785814	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.182733808341	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.273377725702	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.26620876172	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.360593462216	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.566476302637	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.567973485686	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.278863262989	But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible.
0.0	0.597566934189	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
0.0	0.709360014032	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.520480795702	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.435481102771	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.258532357723	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.287388321276	It's true.
0.0	0.268821100495	It's become more complicated.
0.0	0.287388321276	That's true.
0.0	0.303290130945	They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.
0.0	0.308847114834	There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better.
0.0	0.71031252465	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.27373967714	I think we all support that.
0.0	0.506013640469	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.538623449267	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.640084672132	But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.
0.0	0.652428667395	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.285453721082	Yeah.
0.0	0.609116993594	Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs.
0.0	0.23219445438	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.183364254092	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.368979945335	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
0.0	0.279418187824	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.407120671377	And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.
0.0	0.262300377101	Those are your enemies.
0.0	0.648309943889	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.68330758122	My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves.
0.0	0.51687904118	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.279811659475	Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.
0.0	0.448000533567	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.710022677809	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
0.0	0.624121149796	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.292971587055	We now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act, and I don't think we should have to be defending it among Democrats.
0.0	0.266961921837	I think what is...
0.0	0.5	Why is that?
1.0	0.317188986766	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.720507748618	Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems.
0.0	0.280714573106	... of $50 billion...
1.0	0.723286129324	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.382948957806	Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.
0.0	0.720903182171	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.270360257755	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.556731115502	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.601480188299	And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion, this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us, and that we stand with them as they have stood with us.
0.0	0.247730318508	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.

0.0	0.241249000885	We never dreamt we'd ever see it."
0.0	0.374259617207	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.277706658361	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.5	There are a lot of things we've got to do in our country, reigning in Wall Street is certainly one of them.
0.0	0.258217201813	I was not the secretary of state...
0.0	0.363866948723	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.298354601782	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.656220581282	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.556731115502	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.601366588137	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
1.0	0.486685730098	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.2783306074	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.245422872066	You don't have to.
0.0	0.469640010575	But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate.
0.0	0.527188772689	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.328628699605	I would like to start with a basic.
1.0	0.625839717192	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.718510492015	They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.
0.0	0.588833424231	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.63591658836	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.41727147916	But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance.
0.0	0.291249366204	Thank you, Marco.
0.0	0.553912759834	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
1.0	0.462073480539	When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.312510303	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.334562659733	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.584789166719	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.571005828347	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.721631935988	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.30033514764	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.316606259317	We don't have victories anymore.
0.0	0.310699838165	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.24724739197	And some, I assume, are good people.
0.0	0.266356481818	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.335906920178	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.600618760211	They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.
0.0	0.561591193019	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.310497784785	Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted.

0.0	0.552884830652	They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea.
0.0	0.239622306473	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.570340987761	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
1.0	0.729632091929	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.
0.0	0.42892850848	We used to have victories, but we don't have them.
0.0	0.712341343181	Kathie, that is the kind of economy I believe, put money in the hands of working people, raise the minimum wage to 15 buck an hour.
0.0	0.628805960333	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.575428863355	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.569713683851	They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
0.0	0.267993367369	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.288849021142	Our vets have been abandoned.

0.0	0.72152060922	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.56955900208	Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform.
0.0	0.281664832292	People have invested a lot of energy into that.
0.0	0.251527944941	So was I, John.
0.0	0.621253125867	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.255165472236	But Obamacare kicks in in 2016.
0.0	0.465747750105	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.634015575337	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.

0.0	0.278956871684	He invoked mine as well.
0.0	0.294550974486	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.297006030685	Fine, I'll take it.
0.0	0.511496418916	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.291355086161	Sit down with people like John Mccain.
0.0	0.630592900454	The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.
0.0	0.271482110356	Bottom line.
0.0	0.557908228728	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.648418459517	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.357462195423	It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control.
0.0	0.243665324485	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.261985081076	You bet they do.
0.0	0.719486211347	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.
0.0	0.583409513613	But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
0.0	0.576014679066	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.363666081552	Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.
0.0	0.212104802617	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
1.0	0.73218431379	And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.
0.0	0.281597891741	I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil.
0.0	0.689871523983	And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.
0.0	0.263145082706	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.210922739633	Well, thank you, John.

0.0	0.407236269504	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.691966700414	Let's put the gun makers and sellers on notice that they're not going to get away with it.
0.0	0.305258400404	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.679107625185	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.696754985539	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.21229403483	... he's really doing some bad...

0.0	0.344579382434	First priority, destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.2462261458	Now, this is getting to be fun.
0.0	0.245422872066	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.248623962525	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.467878570993	That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities.
0.0	0.269986703359	I've done an amazing job.
0.0	0.608779787293	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.

0.0	0.349527528278	In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.
0.0	0.292376311825	That is exactly...
0.0	0.594048947914	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.698914838312	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.699276669876	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.716292534819	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.
0.0	0.6943126483	In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston.
0.0	0.484600988435	We have a corrupt campaign finance system dominated by Super PACs.
0.0	0.335212366794	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.686355556746	Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves.
0.0	0.316318396248	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.315916025674	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.215490814095	I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie.
0.0	0.509355024159	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.311898384457	All of these are very difficult issues.
0.0	0.647922331864	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.525035737028	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.400828806254	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.469177746816	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.62281685306	I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones.
0.0	0.442074715922	When was the last time you heard China is killing us?
0.0	0.336159872159	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.271848025197	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.333672422411	The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.277096981409	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.246094989231	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.549010302583	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.613934177292	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.492883521217	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.450929412643	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.451324947537	Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.
0.0	0.658564527035	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.255057197728	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.389598607175	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.263443720211	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.701916101034	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.220547282296	The facts are are very, very simple.
0.0	0.400166531947	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.

0.0	0.307399735528	Let me just...
0.0	0.411048990948	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.269940953666	Just a little bit.

0.0	0.26204411314	They're not good.
0.0	0.586984971131	Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people.
0.0	0.296026645799	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
1.0	0.234522383673	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.538486793124	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.247062861743	Let it be for everybody.
0.0	0.237462446659	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.697413490986	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.
0.0	0.594636863947	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.310452498211	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.360080185873	We've enacted it in our state.
0.0	0.281855387565	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.344067032001	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
1.0	0.744248984157	They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.
0.0	0.285741257235	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.323294359968	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.556731115502	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.617311606299	I mean, let's talk about this arc of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about.
0.0	0.260296048455	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.269216552158	And I applaud his record in Maryland.
0.0	0.634905374094	And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.
0.0	0.316500282916	We got $18 trillion in debt.
1.0	0.607209126022	In fact, wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century, after my husband's administration.
0.0	0.302034052058	He couldn't answer the question.
0.0	0.303498498825	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.269523144819	I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary...
0.0	0.565269783021	Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage.
0.0	0.444066104275	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.507282966102	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.253280210477	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.309563059029	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.351449674536	We need to define the enemy.
0.0	0.547922960607	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
0.0	0.701154160664	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.426038876818	You do.
0.0	0.362066904557	Because a lot of people said, "He'll never run.
0.0	0.302959310814	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.245070699292	But they're not good.
0.0	0.239340287743	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.472630387628	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.694534158405	I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.
0.0	0.261384337579	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.278730169034	Yes, I apologize.
0.0	0.55543968858	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.267523009279	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.72182740069	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.267419200738	Ask Boeing.
0.0	0.273607820284	You know why?
0.0	0.362007752846	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.589630214846	And that this world, with American leadership, can and must come together to destroy them.
0.0	0.476072419722	So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.
0.0	0.492181524743	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.204171696623	That's calling it what it is.
0.0	0.356295467085	Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.
0.0	0.42918403241	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.285418699408	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.227289406619	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.650438810676	... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.367203755129	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.610662814566	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.701869268931	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.678702407403	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
1.0	0.599676257979	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.
0.0	0.288437671597	It was an investment bank.
0.0	0.545590071464	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.556731115502	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.24592250474	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.70826606548	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.337032299038	Like we have a -- we have a lot of work to do and we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do.
0.0	0.43121622139	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
0.0	0.180598760658	Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country.
0.0	0.22024134245	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.308462405926	And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.346450472297	If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune.
0.0	0.387642678403	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.277947558939	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.333748454681	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.659566838868	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.640077354088	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.317532960406	Nobody can do that like me.
0.0	0.36547337328	We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.
1.0	0.872912000712	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.446960602732	And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?
0.0	0.549462287627	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.276025736665	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.645602554017	So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.
0.0	0.538255401675	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.250167047329	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.340082988434	We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.
0.0	0.462858949926	No, I have not.
0.0	0.262230312299	And I opposed it.
0.0	0.721748180734	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.334378202908	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.279126268052	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.689522786931	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.70184069364	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.286473233857	We need sound money.
0.0	0.460717547646	Of course the United States must lead.
1.0	0.445184156651	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.19997473587	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.689411813333	Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.
0.0	0.269514776399	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.351293057942	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.362321343186	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.277578986518	...
0.0	0.265346565745	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.339916210894	It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.
0.0	0.506107465676	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
0.0	0.270048829968	No, John.
0.0	0.387576144696	We have people that aren't smart.
0.0	0.302307373277	Let's get rid of Assad later.
0.0	0.259994206497	Great.
0.0	0.360195792644	I watched the video of Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.42450349343	I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.
0.0	0.546612370236	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.63064629967	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.307706584587	This country is changing.
0.0	0.33165278039	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.50785152362	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.484570731648	But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything -- everything, they got away with it again.
0.0	0.608054280389	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.366608584972	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.417802408651	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.
0.0	0.601624086189	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.272457327227	I will...
0.0	0.391205813882	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.672496168617	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
1.0	0.644718482378	This small country has welcomed in many refugees.
0.0	0.375872329059	My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.
0.0	0.336134985277	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.707618395359	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.485296799666	The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.
0.0	0.589761671668	We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it.
0.0	0.260815810941	Not only -- not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton -- and I hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- I want to apologize to my supporters.
0.0	0.590638072687	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.271743678292	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.568453111003	Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?
0.0	0.438664301688	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.242982243042	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.441677403704	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.309576282595	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.492658602497	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.558077828787	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.271049540427	He does great.
0.0	0.61379174465	Now that Russia has joined us in the Security Council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago, now I think we can have those conversations.
0.0	0.240371017314	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.589463483983	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.
0.0	0.454383588085	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.356920140919	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.265942033162	He's very smooth.
0.0	0.314607234295	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.576441851281	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.640481555516	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.277639945655	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.241320827029	And I think has had a big impact.
0.0	0.253391939914	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.265219130175	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.266542859038	I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.647355126994	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.5	They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there.
0.0	0.519087313355	If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.
0.0	0.602505645847	My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.
0.0	0.26235525787	That's for sure.
0.0	0.458682073292	But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.69565328382	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.684592312299	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
0.0	0.419577786443	But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.
1.0	0.690373961201	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.237332438011	Now, here's what is going to happen.
0.0	0.422428936365	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.296362718393	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.445892601006	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.467871920664	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.281599799911	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.5	And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't."
0.0	0.617783552769	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.278696592868	I've dealt with them all my life.
0.0	0.224600273983	I think the issue here is -- and I applaud Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.5272173437	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.314899302241	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.248056858847	That's what really matters.
0.0	0.692182605976	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.308538474066	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.279187359752	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.218582255016	I do not think it would come to that.
0.0	0.478551257661	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.527851549251	And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
0.0	0.408131322318	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.26675102061	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.287763495869	They can't.
0.0	0.280312963299	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.441457399554	Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
0.0	0.394687217789	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.359472033402	I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.
0.0	0.416969642233	But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go.
0.0	0.291737628138	She was right.
0.0	0.271091600367	It's great to be at Trump Tower.
0.0	0.424298966041	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.59339202593	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.281719835727	Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server.
0.0	0.538103191082	I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.
0.0	0.292778470819	She never lived to see that.
1.0	0.327522446793	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.442132536139	The young officer who was killed responding to the Planned Parenthood murders.
0.0	0.710129830795	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.379313759953	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.595619670541	But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it.
0.0	0.439662785068	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
0.0	0.256449465953	I introduced...
0.0	0.449672241182	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
1.0	0.278202733652	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.682430616356	Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint.
0.0	0.434467618463	What are we doing?
0.0	0.375571823121	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.719603469297	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.262203396689	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.585899751863	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.431173985347	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.573515028165	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.28892283346	We bailed out Wall Street.
0.0	0.441768617561	But the United States is not the policeman of the world.
0.0	0.354875914168	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.246689145197	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.505159058561	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.309224278502	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.381497971498	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.389118659778	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.695802236564	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.294932849885	I mean, that's a fact.
1.0	0.768651099882	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
1.0	0.266358409298	It was below zero.
0.0	0.561924423953	And I understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary.
0.0	0.556641854901	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.277584173518	No.
0.0	0.297679916446	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
0.0	0.56995617777	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.587869932816	We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game.
0.0	0.544936597351	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.201335040857	And before I say it, I have to say this.
0.0	0.35189922926	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.46625353809	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.35709389036	...Thank you.
0.0	0.5	But there is a broad consensus on sensible gun safety regulations that I, coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, will do my best to bring together.
0.0	0.481213279426	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.304772691581	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.264492893654	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.679463947343	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.569679890689	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.200641313925	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.650418037951	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.263539940023	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.358339491039	It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act.
0.0	0.34490005812	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.291935909719	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.279635179893	But get this.
0.0	0.726053892008	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.510572293919	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.435813448628	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.517076306407	The number of heroin deaths are growing very, very significantly.
0.0	0.620183513389	Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.
0.0	0.439648098595	And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
0.0	0.446525275725	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.274713196244	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.693867388968	And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.
0.0	0.395357668976	I gotta build those big buildings.
0.0	0.677922520318	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.395817693038	They are anxious on a number of levels.
0.0	0.517517968025	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.
0.0	0.303771931861	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.449955460629	Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...
0.0	0.339217656937	And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.
0.0	0.356897138906	We expand Medicare to all people.
0.0	0.252384124648	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.640730107518	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.282585531321	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.277584173518	So...
0.0	0.687192333461	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.559869916965	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.309581925633	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.297440630209	Can I -- can I -- I just...
0.0	0.253939630964	And, we said no.
0.0	0.270750559542	But this is what we also have to say.
0.0	0.379287423577	Close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole and...
0.0	0.309271873079	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.430557053171	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.229072085767	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.650929134077	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.70021880874	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.267028668168	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.586927550651	I do agree that in particular, Turkey and the Gulf nations have got to make up their minds.
0.0	0.234684403743	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.215119335498	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.722791158725	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.299351547684	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.
0.0	0.277584173518	These...
0.0	0.714871023333	Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons -- three out of four people in prison are black or brown.
0.0	0.661632996578	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.532032221514	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.428045568635	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.336191799558	Yes, we must protect our borders.
0.0	0.297108420395	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.382566250628	We got a U.N. Security council vote.
0.0	0.26029981376	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.267440411773	Let's keep going.
0.0	0.600166639184	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.272733641481	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.284967329737	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.47487286428	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
0.0	0.462122815564	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.2594607401	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.597571952825	We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally.
0.0	0.223539229868	I don't think it's gonna happen.
0.0	0.307163210636	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.299292271878	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.704443096644	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.288142116497	There must be some way.
0.0	0.412068709587	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.464244604965	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.264091193796	It's their money.
0.0	0.207016148861	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.450585128984	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.266134733406	Absolutely.
1.0	0.317189329784	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.222563544414	And we're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.287937489123	I know every one.
0.0	0.221715074826	What are you going to do for my kids?
0.0	0.373896697056	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.35026578226	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.347912777978	So, yes, this has developed.
0.0	0.288183944633	I like it.
0.0	0.309405598069	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.670690575571	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.237876423405	There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.
0.0	0.288383782371	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.64476583781	But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
0.0	0.696685134526	Sit down with people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the house, and work on a bill.
0.0	0.252761974585	I don't think so.
0.0	0.334094666719	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.5	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.695512422993	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.69759278368	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.253930061498	Does anyone know this?"
0.0	0.328748267365	Revolution never came.
0.0	0.300921045863	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.302127842239	Last point.
0.0	0.594623552555	As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country.
0.0	0.287097336582	You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.
0.0	0.410801240981	I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.
0.0	0.456353199523	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...
0.0	0.268365006641	And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that.
0.0	0.720374539643	I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground.
0.0	0.287224793522	And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.
0.0	0.607220540121	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.231361876869	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.346568313999	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.273418292775	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
0.0	0.5	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.386519168585	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.2546618154	And they wanted to make sure it got built.
0.0	0.601155512226	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.146938906889	Kathie, I think -- Kathie the...
0.0	0.511241730913	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.41135084014	We were the first in the family.
0.0	0.61991456574	I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.701275051819	Against the Republican leadership, who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies.
0.0	0.544388853219	But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.
0.0	0.215821927336	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.285640079527	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.389262630168	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.703693972469	If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences.
0.0	0.516929451294	You read about all the companies now that are doing business -- about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on.
0.0	0.295732768762	Those hedge funds.
0.0	0.520041658825	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.209563149656	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.246720879519	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.603846280799	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.591454930973	Given the fact that she's a lot smarter than me, yes, she would.
0.0	0.307456841035	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.253187185743	All right.
0.0	0.609909660877	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.277095957297	We're friends.
0.0	0.210795435688	You want me to answer that question?
1.0	0.715474063458	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.322635096165	It really is important that we go forward on this.
0.0	0.674861572317	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.642236701001	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.277120515651	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.709991933386	And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals -- the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
0.0	0.696043842885	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.23610197304	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.287228227154	She led that effort.
0.0	0.5	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.268709393999	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.52695441819	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.28048915709	Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.
0.0	0.264064853569	It's not true.
0.0	0.262770954351	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.334465665101	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.321113805523	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.215666277434	And it's-- it's a worthy debate.
0.0	0.366245620028	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
0.0	0.459253007811	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.710542549812	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.284579442498	We actually did it.
0.0	0.721736139761	We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.
0.0	0.717325254969	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.594891972874	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
1.0	0.378096513848	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.677247861741	That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.487949768933	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.272367710176	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.259328946422	Yes.
0.0	0.277578986518	...
0.0	0.279113096001	Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors.
0.0	0.261987994625	I (inaudible).
0.0	0.203396050455	I think he would have been right.

0.0	0.689868668366	I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries.

0.0	0.24386309978	Not bad.
0.0	0.379013793164	But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that.

0.0	0.723243072334	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.721751615954	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
0.0	0.38761655601	And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent.

0.0	0.313434979415	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.52146074679	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.415866020965	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.52871515605	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?

0.0	0.437365157746	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
1.0	0.351406091612	The Republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times.
0.0	0.528644757844	I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work.
0.0	0.311161608619	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.339148467572	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.665164366166	I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.505004616886	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.520564816492	First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino.

0.0	0.5	No, no.
0.0	0.332660687836	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.52825466477	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.622425827586	I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war.
0.0	0.258142862041	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.346774051737	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.28237731172	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.51700547187	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.467728503063	I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it.
0.0	0.537733634725	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.293579354832	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.245216580037	Sure did.
0.0	0.47749270122	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.276137935409	Are you not running?
0.0	0.371436940418	We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
0.0	0.212612237348	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?
0.0	0.27186281315	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.292331687651	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
0.0	0.547517891638	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.629626062232	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.702995439703	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.267783886202	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.394195883734	And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.545613436421	I've employed -- I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
0.0	0.603853958331	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.
0.0	0.370804336275	Well, I would just repeat that.
0.0	0.365189991107	I sell apartments for -- I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.
0.0	0.600139738184	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
0.0	0.247232853041	Sure.
0.0	0.291852914135	I said no.
0.0	0.364260919398	There won't be any -- you can get it.
1.0	0.347991083989	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.22864350069	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.300148946552	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.5	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.420781539802	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.466462180506	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.43959135444	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.298702933613	It goes away.
0.0	0.368274574274	The troops on the ground should not be American troops.
0.0	0.309935677102	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.569668365366	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.5	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.592766634654	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.601570595648	And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.
0.0	0.388097245571	And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation.
0.0	0.614561080365	I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.
0.0	0.268294963293	Then I looked at Rubio.
0.0	0.50860458212	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.479882547647	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.580406087235	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.66430203241	RADDATZ: OK. Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, right here at Saint Anselm college, Neil Levesque.
0.0	0.476885329037	The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court?
0.0	0.290440983097	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.702591162032	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.243565017706	Right.
0.0	0.277578986518	...
0.0	0.280795665951	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.288082502837	It all will be scrutinized.
0.0	0.288183944633	I like them.
0.0	0.578369850573	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.298240529165	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.581685272754	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.380854975878	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.46735329441	As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.
1.0	0.749390677513	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.525663043597	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...
0.0	0.674207064951	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
0.0	0.526576843821	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.420895026957	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.219266045775	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.276117361411	Excuse me, no.
0.0	0.553276823639	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.256899921246	I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail.
0.0	0.354717040158	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.264187536502	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
1.0	0.810121025625	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.655048570652	Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem.
0.0	0.595409403794	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.513857868013	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.628007624039	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.
0.0	0.237950253747	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.641331751445	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.701629916868	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.
0.0	0.481826859088	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.
0.0	0.27694503769	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.57258082739	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.33819967092	Many are in this building.
0.0	0.482338605479	And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage.
0.0	0.440039901114	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.701380826899	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.684606739496	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
1.0	0.459742075245	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.261348492551	Go ahead.
0.0	0.64619696583	You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.
0.0	0.426038876818	You did.
0.0	0.620428778583	We need -- we need somebody -- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.
0.0	0.389953853818	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.319599409345	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.544465649075	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.721472259904	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.253853089299	I said, "What's your problem?"
0.0	0.381106105492	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.576506859008	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.288183944633	I like that.
0.0	0.704369201128	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.265591840794	Get rid of the fraud.
0.0	0.201753259276	Thank you very, very much.
0.0	0.293590308138	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.665489372613	John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.
0.0	0.623671503208	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.423493100557	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.277584173518	No.
1.0	0.540471418314	And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.
0.0	0.297183489989	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
0.0	0.251473164897	They should be Muslim troops.
0.0	0.274464166797	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.

0.0	0.629201290584	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.700993088031	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.477341544571	If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen.
0.0	0.321748026685	I'll advertise my Web site as well.
0.0	0.484836318193	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.

0.0	0.521841314406	I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
0.0	0.690897588638	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.480556289905	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.
0.0	0.364075543048	He said, "I can't get it into China.
1.0	0.280212979261	They're bringing drugs.
0.0	0.219195158353	Here's what I'd do.
0.0	0.29425762969	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.26334463113	That is the issue.
0.0	0.478136783989	Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.
1.0	0.722862591183	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.273988621655	We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love -- they're great -- all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.
0.0	0.311679108409	And, I will tell you, I love my life.
0.0	0.291636373552	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.430864411864	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.242080150791	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.344448037664	Martha -- I would just repeat that --
0.0	0.33068645263	And it will have effects in the private market.
0.0	0.623383867112	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.680214487866	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.

0.0	0.685436416293	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.485155239379	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.264096034558	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.263336534912	Let's reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.332553862971	She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.
0.0	0.630533899724	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.359603092998	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.568561995836	I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal.
0.0	0.282969257405	And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.
0.0	0.259564577436	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
0.0	0.368943851231	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.375334550934	The nature of warfare has changed.
0.0	0.512927239075	Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military.
0.0	0.47131672407	So I said (ph), "No, that's the wrong number.
0.0	0.264659326873	Let's have a Democratic Syria.

0.0	0.274478362429	We don't eliminate Medicare.
0.0	0.337063216743	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.487965390692	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.277919853823	I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country.
0.0	0.390118482308	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.24132122612	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.715184207995	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.247582185144	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.277584173518	Both.
0.0	0.713448512699	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.287279422935	They are going to have to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.63098748553	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.255824942048	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.447472048877	They are our first line of defense.
0.0	0.28049905264	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.264562441196	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.291962093805	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.479982272012	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.272214106227	Whoa.
0.0	0.362370460464	I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.
0.0	0.306344234875	So ladies and gentlemen...I am officially running...... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.
0.0	0.265194394961	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.319132256283	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.627995127342	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.623247653714	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.697521278792	It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.363189522622	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.269409748701	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.391806569261	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.379944793408	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.370055236411	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.48687857721	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.513319427295	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.45199531758	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.623626538004	And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.
0.0	0.310926391196	By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job.
0.0	0.261680463717	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.513050924737	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.671871514146	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.646643637068	We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents.
0.0	0.612578104548	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.469564816592	When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish Glass-Stegall.
0.0	0.271383968247	It's nice.
0.0	0.564041562424	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.593049031838	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.279377973547	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.275765388828	The formula is working.
0.0	0.276173117699	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.64743588523	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.602021998729	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.289671614608	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.28565735223	What is the best way to do it?
0.0	0.271765247764	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.257062400865	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.710637486991	But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.
0.0	0.559621480966	The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
0.0	0.5	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.5	this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.
0.0	0.308106410534	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.360425693945	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.48578133681	And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work.
0.0	0.235423968328	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.248495785781	We're up 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.600585791763	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.174619049995	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.272466888717	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.5	And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go.
0.0	0.575835343526	So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again.
0.0	0.612181168479	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.274713196244	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.4202886809	We are already de-conflicting air space.
0.0	0.648620047061	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.337372640585	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.467521253563	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.233479682393	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.292176015658	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.3027032621	We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
0.0	0.561529878296	This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.
0.0	0.251713393195	They thought something was wrong.
0.0	0.254261223767	I don't want it.
0.0	0.645491119868	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
0.0	0.236664627433	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.262626749537	We get a traitor.
0.0	0.352754109777	First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, "they cannot have it all."
0.0	0.637647919855	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.225314556035	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.284443887637	In all due respect...
0.0	0.6495999749	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
1.0	0.714919002163	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.660033085854	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.264287990547	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.544508234623	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.642219981342	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.306845163081	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.458720379777	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.638460596567	We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.435306557038	They will be our early warning signal.
0.0	0.282914089409	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
0.0	0.427125800174	We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.
0.0	0.292143143732	I like China.
0.0	0.264598020223	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.
0.0	0.6369468265	I believe that our Federal Government needs to do more on pell grants.
0.0	0.448750883622	But he used to say, "Donald, don't go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.522980988943	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.510727007724	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.704445084989	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.21520638096	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.378729113977	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.267193540812	No criminal records for them.

0.0	0.602959851444	You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster.
0.0	0.301260462025	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.282758848123	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.411312745885	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.176987259546	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.30913796199	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
1.0	0.755440380678	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.5	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.253615439132	And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people.
0.0	0.27437139418	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.262056192726	Please go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.297267851228	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.292929926764	That's the secondary issue.
0.0	0.168352595778	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.241987132057	I promise.
0.0	0.662933228419	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.450532232221	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.267625946559	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.480562531323	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.264668506267	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.666254347683	John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL, and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening.
1.0	0.728100443007	Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?
0.0	0.295589428813	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.262648863258	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.44054451888	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
0.0	0.269003159614	What have you got now?
0.0	0.268172181699	They've advertised that.
0.0	0.458235810827	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.
0.0	0.467673791898	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.280805189793	You don't serve us.
0.0	0.460753319704	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.586377351307	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.704055797196	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.253187185743	All right.
0.0	0.246116457695	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.40764301812	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.279814577089	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.356719492681	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.386770875375	I will work my heart out.
0.0	0.400416559553	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.534935508147	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.
0.0	0.281562807731	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.237510267611	I would invite him, I actually would say.
0.0	0.712630314818	I've had had two town halls, one in Keene, one in Laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do.
0.0	0.438964366701	It's very important we operate on both at the same time.
0.0	0.271109162804	Oh.
0.0	0.543998699767	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.38149828513	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.619259436532	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.647563649944	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
0.0	0.439677698296	But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."
0.0	0.55894816719	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.272649327635	I really am.
0.0	0.296185090156	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.581066926968	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
0.0	0.27490605107	It was terrible.
0.0	0.488530293188	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.282486613303	I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.
0.0	0.202104158881	We're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.303159405814	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.329767960453	I want security.
0.0	0.491715044156	And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.689041936157	We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States.
0.0	0.343877943701	First of all...
0.0	0.578990136289	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.542854951805	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.475281701799	Well, there are so many, I don't know where to start.
0.0	0.376317685906	People were just being fined to death.
0.0	0.396405978926	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.291737628138	That's right.
0.0	0.509734362983	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.335957966447	I beat China all the time.
0.0	0.650006954769	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.415204328548	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.5	Why is it...
0.0	0.481209500798	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
1.0	0.724296700889	And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent.
1.0	0.725415127512	And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions.
0.0	0.272345956855	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.239815899575	If not, they can stay where they are.
0.0	0.3196459883	Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.
0.0	0.261124456093	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.286473233857	We need sound money.
0.0	0.542672262825	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.698649665293	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.568369443936	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.305748087646	If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say?
0.0	0.450185717982	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.308105065502	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.615782486759	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.43999872995	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.55883114083	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.329339815344	Might I respond?
0.0	0.260420401963	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.259547451085	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.274464935648	I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that's what Iowans like to do.
0.0	0.380104925383	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.601390315379	But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired.
0.0	0.284579442498	But actually I am.
0.0	0.394729272205	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.380583654493	It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino.
0.0	0.278082866349	I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country.
0.0	0.223649337967	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.262260004101	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.284339753242	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.254284976359	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.445382265345	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.269595777849	They're killing us.
0.0	0.332927239835	They would never be hired again.
1.0	0.355077025199	That's wrong.
0.0	0.5	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.509935027533	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.589107105188	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.444356692807	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.271831942368	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.487453762965	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
1.0	0.464068523267	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.568134389431	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.572984940838	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
0.0	0.375169191676	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.360970340575	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.541125337782	Here's my promise-- Wall Street representatives will not be in my cabinet.
0.0	0.689249902447	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.684530885305	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.330944312804	That never works.
0.0	0.27089040306	it won't happen.
0.0	0.366259738923	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
0.0	0.516832415587	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.617375370344	They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
0.0	0.517764941747	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.664151329254	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.271777017145	Go on to my website.
0.0	0.555559331734	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.474992433392	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.25216553623	I want a job."
0.0	0.392109157956	And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence.
0.0	0.232787282245	And, look, there are profound differences...
0.0	0.249319281117	And they're wonderful people.
0.0	0.236570595469	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.340128081738	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.344027436622	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.271561530129	Don't believe it.
0.0	0.19344807051	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
0.0	0.192546242548	I am the son and grandson of immigrants.
0.0	0.25861000707	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.374069658899	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.286177041618	You cannot grant amnesty.
0.0	0.274320378974	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.60501487501	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.45141594001	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.406954675716	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.299012057988	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.625154493287	It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.
0.0	0.347729298342	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.243565017706	Right.
0.0	0.258383324963	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.524393877166	Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, "Sorry, fellas.
0.0	0.666995618142	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.238282020489	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.601802581535	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.71904271105	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.253846857052	No problem.
0.0	0.287630933221	John, the world is a very dangerous place, but the world is not too dangerous of a place for the United States of America, provided we act according to our principles, provided we act intelligently.
0.0	0.700786218408	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.291969278553	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.313251460121	I...
0.0	0.56969628972	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.556896173174	But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.
0.0	0.507517527877	Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.
0.0	0.522068020175	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.28928054302	We have people that have no incentive to work.
0.0	0.238921384127	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.294228719425	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.600293169667	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.390100486007	It -- it doesn't need to be that way.
0.0	0.359923262599	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.344555235939	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.670804005911	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.26673842535	They are ripping us.
0.0	0.674200589341	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.684537532038	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.276886513289	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.443366151518	I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons.
1.0	0.353389843695	But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works.
0.0	0.600818496122	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.217427427548	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
1.0	0.278645592572	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.300477088311	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.439952318727	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.59344891914	Good company.... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in -- and I wouldn't even use -- you know, I have -- I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
0.0	0.33124789663	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.277584173518	Why?
0.0	0.254828858501	They wouldn't be there except for us.
0.0	0.28981320795	We were the first to pass a minimum wage.
0.0	0.237180639094	I know.
0.0	0.644436824152	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.281468937419	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.486175481569	I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security.
0.0	0.275609473732	We got it.
0.0	0.679242452819	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.63386127153	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.240564339045	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.241444393661	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.249019098434	We don't know anything about that.
0.0	0.60638725874	Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.
0.0	0.556671992914	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.
0.0	0.59418560193	The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign.
0.0	0.250803031356	You want to know what carpet bombing is?
0.0	0.299205851898	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.675453491439	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.280194696095	So you might not.
0.0	0.279285758528	We are not France.
0.0	0.517933005705	But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it.
0.0	0.288736965192	May I respond to the critique on the ...
0.0	0.46318504725	I led the effort, unfortunately unsuccessfully, against deregulation because I knew when you merge large insurance companies and investment banks and commercial banks it was not going to be good.
1.0	0.41022788057	He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage, and what its effects are.
0.0	0.224232282669	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.344256726611	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.258142862041	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.277578986518	...

0.0	0.590141289682	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.720696278291	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.641588628803	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.

0.0	0.72703278524	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.426038876818	That is...
0.0	0.303129776692	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.436895618736	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.322961729338	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.564230276876	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.275221880385	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.357595662965	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.636655482314	Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.
0.0	0.542006641551	And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
0.0	0.307615493219	It's interesting that Jeb mentions the book.
0.0	0.614665601902	Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.
0.0	0.226005720186	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.262246420648	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.633917650202	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.401755241451	And it's impossible for our people here to compete.
0.0	0.598976738597	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.270559024396	I agree with them.
0.0	0.594352214861	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
0.0	0.417742587058	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.410849136446	I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.
0.0	0.371850211977	That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.
0.0	0.36521065617	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.731349440174	What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS.
0.0	0.718332027098	We cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of moral nations around this Earth, we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats, because Martha, this will not be the last region where nation-states fail.
0.0	0.671600791295	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
0.0	0.49094194669	And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
0.0	0.604263748348	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.
0.0	0.208551869345	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.30162252719	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.
0.0	0.648157032193	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.206250964382	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.45548830786	Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.
0.0	0.693299731127	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.410186575158	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.639765903312	We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS, which is a danger to us as well as the region... SANDERS (?
0.0	0.277492791283	We can do that.
0.0	0.577397416103	If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
0.0	0.273008366923	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.339430337852	Yes, and it was the same one that President Obama made.
0.0	0.368126286665	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.322991161502	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.271747050095	Just get me a job.
0.0	0.240064385118	I understand.
0.0	0.414573268605	That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
0.0	0.327662221484	Well, I just want to quickly add...
0.0	0.335223857712	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.276138368731	Well, I did.
0.0	0.246805060015	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.69283716607	Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values.
0.0	0.321019830292	End -- end Common Core.
0.0	0.287802794287	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.263547719159	So it is difficult.
0.0	0.296746525654	You want to see a war on women?
1.0	0.477702629718	Today, we have 272.
0.0	0.424995867546	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.724708873396	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.546561990519	We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations.
0.0	0.54766854788	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.348216490685	I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone.
0.0	0.229639140197	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.657843360328	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.395867091017	Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.
0.0	0.321365127581	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.365019965079	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.660649713658	But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks."
0.0	0.247706801359	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.602014383647	The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.387242709437	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.551967377034	One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines.
0.0	0.392928164543	I'm meeting with three of them in the next week.
0.0	0.269672187568	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.249225898624	Very valuable.
0.0	0.239154215289	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.250723389716	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.672354123348	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.606961845568	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.677953565268	Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.
0.0	0.444610228729	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.60242911579	But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
0.0	0.348882216622	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.641790207459	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.41194560105	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.275244197176	That's good.
0.0	0.397689147843	I want security for this country.
1.0	0.554889838947	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.343637558061	Their business model is greed and fraud.
0.0	0.278367916643	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
0.0	0.332707692522	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.455654879798	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
0.0	0.265322090356	We offered a lot more.
0.0	0.614292859101	The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.
1.0	0.568499423532	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.220994438771	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.366450323927	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.344039699521	But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
0.0	0.262137926226	Go on to martinomalley.com.
0.0	0.270198675017	Alright.
0.0	0.452368798284	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.377970725531	So we need people -- I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.587466358667	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.
0.0	0.264852387926	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.703082237479	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.42748044166	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.56867423971	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.66594057617	I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.
0.0	0.593420472735	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.594324402813	Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.
0.0	0.247873295233	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.245317411797	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.307272264051	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.597716181688	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.236767012357	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.296021883272	You know where their United States headquarters is located?
0.0	0.308834313219	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.370022420764	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.248561797342	If I am elected president...
0.0	0.267631033804	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.694160365637	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.24620971609	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.582338565324	Well, I think it's perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid.
0.0	0.278651488374	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.282396509014	There are many lawyers.
1.0	0.276365899879	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.31918065886	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.697457727087	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.43994982335	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.277584173518	No.
0.0	0.350900296107	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.322319901747	And Abdullah said something recently, very important.
0.0	0.723895968093	But accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000.
0.0	0.521686900478	But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
0.0	0.27480330659	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.345622185021	These are very, very real issues.
0.0	0.679056853221	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.556731115502	I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.
0.0	0.669898684158	We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations.
0.0	0.294066163146	You get together.
0.0	0.646130835507	Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country.
0.0	0.63326898775	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.530450524637	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.289889320657	Our country is in crisis.
0.0	0.321944003946	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.488880197548	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.295850352682	So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.
0.0	0.315637459259	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.5	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.
0.0	0.281116380351	For her convenience.
0.0	0.387106120603	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.246017922183	He's a bad negotiator.
0.0	0.568555345296	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
1.0	0.451791935447	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.292656609596	We're running.
0.0	0.409583625967	They can't even answer simple questions.
0.0	0.380410320268	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.25829851315	And the fact is it was wrong.

0.0	0.610228046003	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.633336891856	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.
0.0	0.277578986518	...
0.0	0.370074870026	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.566094747101	Now, this takes, David, 18 months to 24 months, two years.
0.0	0.587673760513	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.238805199852	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.42483735759	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.457195211921	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.591780511639	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
0.0	0.685255637607	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.342841944462	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.293873292404	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.689333486775	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.5	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.611418904087	I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.
0.0	0.333955602751	People were shocked, Trump got it.
0.0	0.271679223491	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.373806785698	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.693733929548	Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
0.0	0.313545163489	Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.
0.0	0.359335356603	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.439615037977	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.547952111332	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.304905129982	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.4673060032	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.526865282695	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.285096846734	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.542122132541	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.336846287712	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.409303326591	The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
0.0	0.470302518361	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.280306278375	Good at email.
0.0	0.245505867945	They're off to China.
0.0	0.682002024696	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.302501745542	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.649556602625	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.33315106075	And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China.
0.0	0.279264332933	That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities.
0.0	0.29077049576	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.313449313121	I like how you stand up.
0.0	0.518546564079	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.406031952875	And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.
0.0	0.24520033036	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.439407394096	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
1.0	0.546557159733	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.264072278053	You count on it.
0.0	0.266075918891	OK?
0.0	0.262248598267	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.250340713006	I hope you'll reconsider.
1.0	0.580777852059	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.408822166731	And now they are beating us economically.
0.0	0.537213138347	ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries.
0.0	0.219285216601	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.396134097344	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.277395111032	I am advocating...
0.0	0.245155379312	We know about the Belgians.
0.0	0.672507985434	I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.
0.0	0.53029480943	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.333659073394	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.25804752144	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.382503268889	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.315681177144	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.547477060361	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.170633650997	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.406483866705	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.43157509338	What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.
0.0	0.278128527937	I love China.
0.0	0.581159162632	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.307578064396	They're terrified by the saber rattling.
0.0	0.257419826516	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
0.0	0.696710104135	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.280403579221	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.248039085592	I am telling the truth.
0.0	0.439858823752	But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.26634496062	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.442204381082	Major crisis and primary health care.
0.0	0.539913156876	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.692465968973	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.513185517779	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.21905266542	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.316514787714	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.425704994252	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.647423079322	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.511177644589	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.520852656844	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.67025133239	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.438891165758	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.527852237385	They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn.
0.0	0.6277676163	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.
0.0	0.707970396161	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
0.0	0.32113793702	Our next president...
0.0	0.63532551902	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.532194839256	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.711593561874	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.265903636266	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.648089433273	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.265374758206	How great is that?
0.0	0.382259492715	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.248663769501	I think so, right.
0.0	0.262221606614	Bill.
0.0	0.344362745963	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.538500057501	There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
0.0	0.490068934049	They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.
0.0	0.392137975534	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.31612008525	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.646571763734	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.
0.0	0.517835785973	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.33373510109	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.546987256539	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.
0.0	0.269887022804	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.550881191086	If you want to make it into the middle class -- I'm not saying in all cases -- we need plumbers, and we need carpenters, and electricians, that's for sure, and they should get help as well.
0.0	0.307438467814	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.526268593317	... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street.
0.0	0.655706681452	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.5	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.312928902577	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.720506765554	What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.291541132607	It will give hope to millions of young people.
0.0	0.634965628771	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.688352015465	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.461002938309	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
0.0	0.649595282083	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.282818705793	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.257372890318	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.523600923611	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.291737628138	That's right.
0.0	0.446581236807	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.272568619421	Wait for what?
0.0	0.488487731685	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.242019658757	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.62886741119	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.43234307175	That is some group of people.
0.0	0.449444762542	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.66894152921	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
1.0	0.816152584707	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.463039461056	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.616789508602	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.31972399944	Everybody thought the deal was dead.
0.0	0.553554730566	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.306508164928	Really big league.
0.0	0.583701024916	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.704951136746	Number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own.
0.0	0.591019583227	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
1.0	0.734017927086	In 1988, just to set the record straight governor, I ran for the U.S. House.
0.0	0.439504258102	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.
0.0	0.365914658201	They have no plan now."
0.0	0.263629507007	Maria...
0.0	0.287021343118	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.38165064312	And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen.
0.0	0.607567808703	They're building up their military to a point that is very scary.
0.0	0.302964289587	I'm not using the lobbyists.
0.0	0.25805935381	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.704051434708	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.390026183879	Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.
0.0	0.287105996075	Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.
0.0	0.369101009548	So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.
0.0	0.19807938984	And I'm confident we can do that.
0.0	0.490219998734	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.600863824817	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.155255458623	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.520261528745	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.475725300174	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.532568551185	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.469674504843	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.330870298757	We're ready to start shooting."
0.0	0.397689147843	I want security for this country.
1.0	0.746219944351	The average middle-class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.329999018491	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.294427565272	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.310649805429	It's making...
0.0	0.316686427995	So, what we want to do is to say, look, we have 11 million people who have been here, many of them for decades.
0.0	0.30646953325	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.277096969958	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.
0.0	0.285454964281	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.721701564695	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.
0.0	0.557972692705	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.680735518878	So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.
0.0	0.283574246387	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.569769188732	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.368656902028	We actually passed a living wage.
0.0	0.266756295887	He didn't know.
0.0	0.608664765248	On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center.
0.0	0.632987513879	On January 20th, 2017, the next president of the United States will walk into the White House.
0.0	0.261739173391	But not for us.
0.0	0.280125797511	It sounds crass.
0.0	0.416007178139	Number one, there are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.700982977387	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
1.0	0.37541058871	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
1.0	0.471871634964	A $5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.408051021276	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.230170337796	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.674661938553	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.439047084666	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.691359299651	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.601409986992	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.367897402993	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.578008745507	I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place.

0.0	0.5	But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.

0.0	0.556639018151	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.192587197077	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.231251735739	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.614057610023	Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS.

0.0	0.221547667615	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.253187185743	All right.

1.0	0.679857821556	We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks a piece.
0.0	0.493414440124	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.600963337889	More importantly, I want kids in Burlington, Vermont, or Baltimore, Maryland, who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade, who don't have a lot of money, whose parents -- like my parents -- may never have gone to college.
0.0	0.590988306629	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.299520534166	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.286571620866	Bigger than that?
0.0	0.318398452115	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.415032732101	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.570728366276	All through the recession, we defended the highest median income in America and the second highest median income for African American families.
0.0	0.297117109884	We raised the minimum wage.
0.0	0.700651992277	We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up.
0.0	0.611252068972	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.245001112627	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.397568980233	We can triple the border patrol.
0.0	0.24520712888	I'm getting to that.
0.0	0.71927571974	You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.
0.0	0.299250613795	Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.
0.0	0.291502114106	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.298563621594	It can happen.
0.0	0.34768668561	And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe.
0.0	0.222158778875	But you know what else they're anxious about?
0.0	0.264846577699	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.400611259316	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.212470888159	I'm going to tell you -- thank you.
0.0	0.247151954402	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.663222503733	I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.
1.0	0.718707460634	And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money.
0.0	0.245190493035	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.355355254445	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
0.0	0.358831383154	I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.251054710308	I can't do it.
0.0	0.700460024018	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.704674190576	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.441244325734	But I agree, as I mentioned a moment ago, with King Abdullah.
0.0	0.284735132596	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.377503749464	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.276954417139	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.507843316793	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.549945549194	They're saying, "Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough."
0.0	0.276792326457	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.264325711985	They won't accept it.
0.0	0.273758285871	They sweated like dogs.
0.0	0.418505085629	This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.
0.0	0.649768140786	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.267318772482	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.245131934651	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.426038876818	But Megyn...
0.0	0.552339262897	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.420156838209	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.293951939638	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.64488072257	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.540317626348	We've got the consensus, what we're lacking is political leadership...
0.0	0.381058357164	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.307691806841	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.428291995562	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.285992019627	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.433518284562	That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them.
0.0	0.699886046783	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.700231132631	We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.
0.0	0.253246292338	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.605542281244	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.6034370003	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.466345402911	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.621654394399	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.
0.0	0.46582759318	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.
0.0	0.664207352373	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.308557598687	He can't have it both ways.
0.0	0.264852752244	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.346771238264	This group needs to be confronted and defeated.
0.0	0.560103111919	So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income.
0.0	0.274960233564	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.713560485582	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.509300872957	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.454886568478	That's what I said to my own public health people.
0.0	0.319653622949	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.538463909493	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.257820164656	When did we beat Japan at anything?
0.0	0.265971192121	I've laid out...
0.0	0.277584173518	But...
0.0	0.407799776582	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
0.0	0.278527157789	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.339960512381	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.696820551679	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.3742224479	You learn that threats always change.
0.0	0.344008696814	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.338277089721	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.518288619963	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.379513561102	They went to the DNC quietly.
0.0	0.403470159697	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.365042864804	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.345966708589	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.283211503137	I feel like...
0.0	0.442684010644	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.300615441495	That is why we need to make...
0.0	0.342273221215	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.279122374042	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.263332878274	We should be supportive of that effort.
0.0	0.665106261564	So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion.
0.0	0.569722653176	And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.
0.0	0.533294651448	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.621357822781	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.346010758319	I mean, my dad went to college on a G.I.
0.0	0.284881057427	I want immigration reform to pass.
0.0	0.69713568646	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.656116493525	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.276322974394	I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.
0.0	0.344027436622	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.417858416265	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.411116000186	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.49428011022	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.2678099466	So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do.
0.0	0.5	We increased education funding by 37 percent.
0.0	0.313136638329	I'm going to support you, and I think that is absolutely appropriate.
0.0	0.428120275918	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.465303182632	We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.
0.0	0.33097536235	That means education.
0.0	0.314297861875	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.357571755806	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.579991471557	I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.
0.0	0.509842950018	David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave.
0.0	0.264251692901	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.22330076574	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.
0.0	0.63822427873	But I said, "Don't hit Iraq," because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East.
1.0	0.682813371715	He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.
0.0	0.562803249156	How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years.
0.0	0.304411165927	The big banks--
0.0	0.573789600743	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.26495927371	I would change them.
0.0	0.605512371501	And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.
0.0	0.281898280185	They would like to rip it up and start all over again, throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now.
0.0	0.283270225721	So protect the Second Amendment.
1.0	0.620327637231	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
0.0	0.697825414266	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.261995415355	No vision at all.
0.0	0.385051012862	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
0.0	0.5	How about this?
0.0	0.564915387694	Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.
0.0	0.399288404703	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
1.0	0.681271140725	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
1.0	0.556626868802	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.615969222987	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.285453721082	Yeah.
0.0	0.346113276592	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.493260553535	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.526557966809	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.388258885729	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.245360315618	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.436104187548	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.
1.0	0.787387490164	So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education.
0.0	0.708586724979	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.609101664044	But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be looking for new sources of energy.
0.0	0.270912014506	In addition to that...
0.0	0.360173434236	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.305001819316	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.329999661146	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.335756109615	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.360259664556	And we need the right people.
0.0	0.690194737626	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.592532432268	You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56 percent, equivalent to 56 percent of the GDP In America.
0.0	0.494500909983	And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.
1.0	0.513209681984	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.417566975419	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
1.0	0.523051579337	I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.
0.0	0.599146965937	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.536724980012	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.534855767964	It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.
0.0	0.589059025058	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.541752340392	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.553742413677	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.294855735513	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.266394755969	John?
0.0	0.262951900697	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.272376816265	And for good cause.
0.0	0.313084551983	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.517308955845	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.286406665358	I'm tested.
0.0	0.323493325973	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.263367185198	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.550683792907	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.539108876806	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.28138440544	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.236273369499	That's what should be done.
0.0	0.485893431707	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.174115923561	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.641717497906	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.623620292462	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.
0.0	0.59480139038	Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.354447827207	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.274891607541	We need to stop that.
1.0	0.686115981835	Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.576515118535	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.277422767785	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
1.0	0.716712220357	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.657894978225	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.369191113562	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.254842144775	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.278349041125	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.458677383322	We have -- I don't know that there's any disagreement here...
0.0	0.344745341415	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.57485077354	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.661028890722	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.246291952002	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.613542342789	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.272500902587	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.601751468453	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.30229063171	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.
0.0	0.302859496125	I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.
0.0	0.261331058106	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.321060550318	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.611246020531	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.636395153776	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.56365907674	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.454320320828	He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, "No interest."
0.0	0.426038876818	It was.
0.0	0.645853565047	They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it."
0.0	0.35429358937	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.523890738647	Martha, we offered a lot more than they were willing to take.
0.0	0.559027615577	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.288124055844	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.5	They're controlled fully -- they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
0.0	0.486177157448	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.725506517347	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.614946753504	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.563586295458	First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty.
0.0	0.645695453419	But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future.
0.0	0.649280014612	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.255249900791	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.262579607497	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.233224472842	It didn't have the votes to pass.
0.0	0.5	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.580464946311	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.518053722852	I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor, I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very, very powerful and most important of all jobs in the United States, the president, whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country.
0.0	0.446208278724	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.390826693474	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.5	This is 2016.
0.0	0.515268055228	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.569538499231	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.315111810642	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.652790033269	You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well.
0.0	0.434467618463	Have to do it.
0.0	0.380298528072	And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.
0.0	0.420845126976	In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance.
0.0	0.572009315544	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.251605873588	There are thing that can be done.
0.0	0.300552004182	Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.
0.0	0.282402772223	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.227279931937	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.308637192815	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.
0.0	0.47209983769	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.34660727855	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.27875891817	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.592612157261	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.297280609447	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.445844772778	Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.274851580855	We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.490946427335	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.579712412752	But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.
0.0	0.662481374288	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.353846365781	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.236548753215	We have to find out what's going on.

0.0	0.542316907107	Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.
0.0	0.702511241598	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.527840854745	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.402648737205	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
1.0	0.688672103523	Today, we have about 4,000.
0.0	0.303071440375	And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.
0.0	0.688997822265	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.299029177476	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.26255414409	And God bless America.
0.0	0.31462295004	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.454424489716	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.422473774519	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.278021671814	And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.
0.0	0.607132209539	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.262382825289	Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name.
0.0	0.487999852012	I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom.
0.0	0.292567417523	The problem is...
0.0	0.392646267027	People have been paying it for years.
0.0	0.605308622078	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.259385433411	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.276933344679	I said, "I don't need it.
0.0	0.541361810795	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.281938294647	That's fine.
0.0	0.398727202858	Saudi Arabia without us is gone.
0.0	0.284986119437	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.685593050374	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.72044112561	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.295124467624	Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability.
0.0	0.261129202843	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.278234530821	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.625346178423	Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts.
0.0	0.270750808905	I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.
0.0	0.297056734456	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.447625693379	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.511243432263	Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate.
0.0	0.231874924994	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.538765914285	Then, in 2008, you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying that we don't need those regulations on the federal level and now you're coming back around here.
0.0	0.28705440901	Do we still have standards?

0.0	0.615908979035	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.300702443733	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.629983721673	I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...
1.0	0.661384240818	And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.
0.0	0.478269868103	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.607347863768	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.
0.0	0.716169059028	But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.
0.0	0.329747288877	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.260393081149	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.584851460641	These are often very long- term kinds of investments that have to be made.
0.0	0.509528523871	And most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that.
0.0	0.69205304098	Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.
0.0	0.637842738306	More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows.

0.0	0.536711886146	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.439532105321	And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition.
1.0	0.632070504444	The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.

0.0	0.578835362094	But bottom line now, is in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or her family.
0.0	0.273545898132	He's wrong.
0.0	0.712473085538	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.

0.0	0.691474135628	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.281323844794	Check it out.

0.0	0.274525618789	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.270436290916	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.697399815346	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.667360464683	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
1.0	0.39083058868	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.

0.0	0.483738565495	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.456871154315	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.642848051905	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.5	We have Dodd-Frank.

0.0	0.380680818441	I started off -- thank you -- I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said -- and I love my father.
1.0	0.527229674371	I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded.
0.0	0.697254897943	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.44896302072	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.616518027106	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.380013456641	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.246449635267	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.244914824954	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.332586741448	And what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.262302285539	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.618059166658	I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
0.0	0.360405004485	It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee.
0.0	0.595616037474	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.311696696178	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.
0.0	0.264678520778	Secretary Clinton is right.
0.0	0.557052253583	But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
0.0	0.510668311872	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.614120362841	You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.
0.0	0.210387967319	I believe we've got to go further.
0.0	0.603628846512	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.620346417504	And together we make it possible for a new generation of young people to refinance their debt and not come out with debt in the future.
0.0	0.70718591341	We should make women third-class citizens, that we should allow children to be sexually assaulted, that they are a danger to modern society.
0.0	0.387010350068	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.253467533662	But I learned a lot.
0.0	0.576843205039	I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses.
1.0	0.546712673533	It didn't say a word about legalization.
0.0	0.286039828121	That is abundantly clear.
0.0	0.242142624559	Let's...
0.0	0.493550074251	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.340334566719	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.654008551927	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.594853512254	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.246416712024	And I've been there.
0.0	0.377149259123	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.355736832599	At the end of the day, if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities.
0.0	0.556731115506	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.350480799547	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.371676646489	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.261731718765	I was the architect.
0.0	0.446799759132	It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested.
0.0	0.571424070587	A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.
0.0	0.733696251412	Tear down the EPA's blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates.
0.0	0.247237972412	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.588658365205	So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.
0.0	0.430567494743	People died, and only three people have been fired.
0.0	0.267579664191	Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down.
0.0	0.24200053567	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.26009058536	You know, I've always had a great deal of respect.
0.0	0.630927836313	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.268641032706	People who we should be welcoming and working with.
0.0	0.316114688137	I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen.
0.0	0.264424828497	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.662435307257	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.592739474653	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.711464681413	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.480609093303	And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina, and many other Republican states, that because of their right wing political ideology, are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act.
1.0	0.591885496353	People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.
0.0	0.217915245026	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.41358751594	Martha, may I -- Martha, may I...
0.0	0.54289518889	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.537506555204	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.265431056181	That's really nice.
0.0	0.388480721613	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.226344682001	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.260090157353	Could we have your support?
0.0	0.461228006514	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.283749654242	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.393130260141	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.259468323466	I know the good ones.
0.0	0.710970777447	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.429648067559	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.612725663443	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.26675102061	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.351612566691	I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace.
0.0	0.363694543933	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.280669859413	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.336563860254	This is revolutionary for education in America.
0.0	0.280309968551	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.720124644271	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.184860560162	And here's what's going to happen.
0.0	0.250290258662	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.556727891853	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.166394270383	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.219832521365	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.310075880407	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.598316621493	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.308977662065	David, I am the very first...
0.0	0.701584841165	For example, it is outrageous that we don't have an opportunity for Medicare to negotiate for lower prices.
0.0	0.506619969048	But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.30707650698	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.262230312299	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.516866992525	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.68053775288	I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.
0.0	0.274129541971	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.261700352529	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.56723076899	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.292250715385	This is a terribly complicated issue.
0.0	0.394516967872	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.319367214446	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.61184205211	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.550350795807	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.394672791836	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.264001070416	That's crony capitalism.
0.0	0.284958460927	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.570011400604	I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures.
0.0	0.281536896748	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...
0.0	0.380840859722	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.563492866095	You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.
0.0	0.251605977784	We have problems with Russia.
0.0	0.263639347466	So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.
0.0	0.282911518952	I learned so much.
0.0	0.302217965306	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.494892223765	And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.
0.0	0.397882262059	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.572882433715	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.241781113825	Say again?
0.0	0.283395768787	Of course you are right.
1.0	0.670211090017	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.

0.0	0.553638429237	So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.

0.0	0.345146566297	None of that information was looked at.
0.0	0.384828531178	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.559712519533	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...

0.0	0.610890684427	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.470732718183	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.

0.0	0.48057959695	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.536986584426	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.677773372394	Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.
0.0	0.557352391184	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.255745688902	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.229673217908	You know what he said to me?

0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.291996424883	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.722887130629	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.41541637431	You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now -- it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run.
0.0	0.259328946422	Yes.
0.0	0.55562636506	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.

0.0	0.330481751331	I want the Buffett Rule to be in effect, where millionaires have to pay 30 percent tax rates instead of 10 percent to nothing in some cases.
0.0	0.413246733436	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.355422659868	First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.
0.0	0.568041747373	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.294089374767	And second of all...
0.0	0.616039459646	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.697042510404	In the 1980s, it was in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Reagan's administration, and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel, and others were murdered.
0.0	0.625266197538	So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.
0.0	0.393806944656	Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.
0.0	0.2869195903	We're dying.
0.0	0.23669054841	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.2787560307	You know, I like Marco.
0.0	0.276262555209	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.416827628063	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
0.0	0.437918025229	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.343047709961	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.426352460271	You can't hide behind parliamentary tricks.
0.0	0.266180573159	Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.
0.0	0.664805173679	And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't.
0.0	0.558705098278	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.442598067902	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.261371940874	Now they're going militarily.
0.0	0.322016836793	I don't need the rhetoric.
0.0	0.288654423495	We listen to you and -- and then we act.
0.0	0.253939630964	That's what I said.
0.0	0.283584625432	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.32991056778	You learn to create feedback mechanisms.
0.0	0.298911039578	I -- you know, know that Senator Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers.
0.0	0.323007278011	I would just...
0.0	0.476957541489	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.371704491068	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.61002925622	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.232683939181	Please think of our founding fathers as you listen.
0.0	0.277982765911	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.685988174969	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.286888595343	Came out great.
0.0	0.645808786617	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.5	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.700835571145	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.267106954256	It's not crass.
0.0	0.277492791283	You can have him.
0.0	0.259328946422	Yes.
0.0	0.293690716699	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.251453005323	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.174229449403	They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
0.0	0.278242040987	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
0.0	0.482291070538	And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.
0.0	0.57868097506	When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it.
0.0	0.288437461725	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.221971295278	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.275812296308	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
0.0	0.341204510475	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.348140010377	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.270550146614	And guess what?
0.0	0.214677573326	We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
0.0	0.282008886592	I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
0.0	0.291547270933	Yes, well, roughly.
1.0	0.517287307428	In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.
0.0	0.387191808568	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.553351963996	We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
0.0	0.603370827163	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.349073366548	But look, we didn't know what was happening next.
0.0	0.275942793996	I never said that.
0.0	0.304314941306	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.540242691617	And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.
0.0	0.277584173518	No.
0.0	0.564472522326	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.158159709599	What would we do if this were ebola?
0.0	0.556791026817	But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.
0.0	0.58422348205	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.290190160816	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.267275047015	I would just say that...
0.0	0.269302342853	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.454927240782	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.54278191166	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.323061806082	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.705980082484	I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
0.0	0.309558566831	... and I encourage everybody watching this tonight to please, acknowledge that by going online at martinomalley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism.
0.0	0.515308829846	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.611647106236	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.295787544914	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
0.0	0.32184990081	I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here...
0.0	0.443832667597	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
0.0	0.264064853569	That's not true.
0.0	0.434467618463	What do we do?
0.0	0.36198699255	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.583833948941	And the answer is: Because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda.
0.0	0.409400644588	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.262252663406	They all have jobs.
0.0	0.279635179893	We get Bergdahl.
0.0	0.269534890811	No, what I would say is this is look, I was the first of the three of us to call for America to accept the 65,000 refugees we were asked to accept.
0.0	0.52581585177	It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.
1.0	0.347389227506	You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small.
0.0	0.270716272206	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.480883012167	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.294699318471	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.355477296239	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
1.0	0.805850732068	There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign.
0.0	0.392023532622	They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.
0.0	0.262522562779	And you know what?
0.0	0.252478851562	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.346971205501	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
0.0	0.315045904463	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.28186193669	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.335565085859	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.333172343186	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.268184933191	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.269735715984	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.542840354291	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.702048676339	But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn't cut and run.
0.0	0.339819642312	Listen, we can solve immigration.
0.0	0.659831412761	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.652227753295	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.374495998506	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.654958282919	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.623846170548	I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.
0.0	0.489281030767	So what I had to do then is go back and start working on a bill that wasn't the bill that I wanted.
0.0	0.302815792184	The world has changed.
0.0	0.590600563686	But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything.
0.0	0.426038876818	But what...
0.0	0.558529604164	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.301035746636	We must anticipate these threats before they happen.
0.0	0.212016629135	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.313678261112	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.455624324744	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.245692983886	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.24808642772	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.589970446276	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.306931244638	I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...
0.0	0.388564416618	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.311371215999	But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America.
0.0	0.604715175684	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.341817927329	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.409757015388	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.269357213712	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.265819718743	Ford.
0.0	0.275839890604	It ain't complicated.
0.0	0.251172049766	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.618048037085	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.317602607972	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.349338996756	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.299182174908	Thank you, John.
0.0	0.623703701141	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	0.705107770217	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.259489521632	We overcame the NRA's objections.
0.0	0.462858949926	I was not at all.
0.0	0.328563204637	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.250191177423	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.296037257988	And we should be a welcoming nation.
0.0	0.358515208754	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.470317147515	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.300527845561	And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.
0.0	0.359870872455	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.445798360525	What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.
0.0	0.70396331986	And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.
0.0	0.622102688492	Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values.
0.0	0.221417186974	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.334787311861	May I respond?
0.0	0.336901451384	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.555871361562	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.296597449569	to save a company.
0.0	0.265510596225	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.414608910774	We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States.
0.0	0.514272181662	I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.
0.0	0.265931582586	That's not right.
0.0	0.268809794597	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.687323858957	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.458821582175	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.434467618463	What do we do?
0.0	0.371349204035	Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody.
0.0	0.486399930613	But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.
0.0	0.344242822875	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.702771214251	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.430204491468	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.559442161166	It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably -- probably -- from the Middle East.
0.0	0.302055789549	I'm using my own money.
0.0	0.424898580642	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.465312218434	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
0.0	0.247400981646	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.
0.0	0.598973259192	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.266089162961	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.5	And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it.
0.0	0.232267651925	...John...
0.0	0.652089948536	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.247346315658	I want to thank the people of Iowa for being so welcoming to me.
0.0	0.619462287571	And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.
0.0	0.397036666818	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.253505301517	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.544495872967	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.264562441196	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.448957511145	We have three children, eight, five and one.
0.0	0.335906920178	I said temporarily.
1.0	0.396957129871	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.323145256742	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.291737628138	That's right.
0.0	0.491831012359	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.561522145702	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.311161608619	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.529585921725	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.492953399092	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
0.0	0.560439975464	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.251987081245	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.436190108209	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.608091221456	China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.329093881251	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.284059334512	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.443694505259	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.653417803238	And, unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage, I actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.198584769354	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.514931397542	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.529526309411	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.418384982477	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.355192680459	We need security.
0.0	0.34426614726	I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not.
0.0	0.397364691528	We need to end minimal sentencing.
0.0	0.205906686898	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.184860560162	But here's what's going to happen:
0.0	0.532132417899	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.689647457407	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.318468925624	My oldest daughter's a teacher.
0.0	0.566322201087	They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care.
0.0	0.704035568592	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.675012106149	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.622738084372	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.559610550665	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.600058799167	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.266478911522	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.559174013868	But here, a total net worth of -- net worth, not assets, not -- a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets -- Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York -- many other places all over the world.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.245463535135	Reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.602860118435	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.262975305753	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.57287249829	But I'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya, you would be looking at Syria.
0.0	0.706921440781	Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.
0.0	0.370102082403	I'll keep -- I'll keep heading in that direction, believe me.
0.0	0.515155799132	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.518623901932	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.443715663435	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.683207040231	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.289075853239	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.545790014644	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.21914986907	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.645807557873	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.277584173518	How?
0.0	0.67786047051	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.616205823188	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.689017197729	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.543517624821	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.
0.0	0.24727705267	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.5	As president, I would make the administrator of USAID an actual cabinet member.
0.0	0.418627601319	We only have one or two.
0.0	0.556909144762	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.266134733406	Absolutely.
0.0	0.558106862842	I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader.
0.0	0.420311261772	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.271956356149	We don't need that.
0.0	0.394157850961	The list goes on because the differences are so stark.
0.0	0.51059000952	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.516339338921	Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take.
0.0	0.614190619661	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
0.0	0.41239536605	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.279020679103	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
1.0	0.517602211756	Very few children.
0.0	0.286140966663	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.282445733461	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.316778722315	We'll be filing it right on time.
0.0	0.35268141091	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.675113233633	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.
0.0	0.331591387599	It's Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.
0.0	0.480402544767	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.256714968363	Neil?
0.0	0.308062766388	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.283257304175	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.5	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.
0.0	0.586883433257	When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal?
0.0	0.274082621853	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.401478004919	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.292561415777	That is important.
0.0	0.277492791283	We can do that.
0.0	0.707613638663	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.228643770303	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.657985645268	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.277584173518	But...
1.0	0.692891953454	And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent.
0.0	0.543674616469	We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.
0.0	0.428233047925	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.702939073485	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.286431123818	He was vibrant.
0.0	0.240628323486	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.24620753898	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.672342316658	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.454441654328	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.397776274815	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.306676660232	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.274517763999	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.262995589347	Yeah, but let me respond...
0.0	0.680958726384	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...

0.0	0.704177533488	We haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.
0.0	0.337683826695	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.367596415936	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.305502510665	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.5	If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.
0.0	0.251863434137	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.252798989349	All of us want equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.556800647804	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
0.0	0.259758463419	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.
0.0	0.349262682777	... First of all -- Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
1.0	0.6434360078	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.5	The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering, these are not the perpetrators.
0.0	0.567967397266	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.685976253293	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.
0.0	0.55999085059	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
0.0	0.277647713314	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.589418946996	And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty.
0.0	0.666822234884	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.714803273514	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.633345081141	And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.
0.0	0.28794840583	Give people a chance.
0.0	0.287247749454	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.526977679634	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.

0.0	0.490256237546	I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.

0.0	0.259328946422	Yes.
0.0	0.527609145331	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.556362680079	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.353989466367	They will never make America great again.
0.0	0.26544544527	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.311546344881	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.558467853114	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.

0.0	0.462858949926	That's what it is.
0.0	0.64798014925	Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.
0.0	0.285453721082	Yeah.
0.0	0.343761264058	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.

0.0	0.67356365584	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.
0.0	0.67049702204	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.714682138912	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.578090099103	I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation.

0.0	0.655866842752	At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.
0.0	0.360133626807	And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous.
0.0	0.685076918318	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.

0.0	0.596019763357	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.307316357035	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.43354550977	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.269720917211	Predominantly African-American and Hispanic.
0.0	0.245618346446	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.576437315429	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.681413547363	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.415903691342	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
1.0	0.620324471435	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.674946966333	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.278614366813	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.348231369383	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.517093630641	I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.
0.0	0.26633502793	We ended up with 56 votes.
0.0	0.510980666547	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.699610672961	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.296266546893	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.5	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.318767733478	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.599741293617	Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.
0.0	0.384907184138	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.262985886738	It's called the politics.
0.0	0.53012264041	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
0.0	0.713789293644	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.277578986518	...
0.0	0.270521561577	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.382694410836	We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.
0.0	0.699579050801	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.269425093955	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.424200022038	I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
0.0	0.428428278419	Fifty-one percent of high school African-American graduates are unemployed or underemployed.
0.0	0.344388662282	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.461893227756	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.443416896936	Millions coming out of school as you indicated, deeply in debt.
0.0	0.505250960145	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.57849861572	And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it.
0.0	0.345799355027	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.595450863231	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.603903512344	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.267383567667	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.612051915936	He said, "Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."
0.0	0.288083185553	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.367631107595	It was the most highly sought after -- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
0.0	0.312559499411	The number of women --
0.0	0.271453846349	I don't care.
0.0	0.270049835595	): Secretary...
0.0	0.570079888395	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.698321877717	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.700095431242	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.69747326253	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.297354460603	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.602690320207	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.265872696012	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.550399097742	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.370965612416	He's the greatest show on earth.
0.0	0.708755118314	And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.604006876674	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.247466082071	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.200907103176	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.703002507903	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.346263405769	We ought to send used equipment, right?
0.0	0.311142371054	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.55276718031	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.262778384449	You looking at me?
0.0	0.270528835864	Think about it.
0.0	0.256550076728	The bill would involve legalization.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.466252346222	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.645976363865	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
1.0	0.742496372122	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.293934471345	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.226529859035	I think we're missing the point here.
0.0	0.222565001721	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.677407953564	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.449113256589	Wall Street today has too much political power.
0.0	0.681867982044	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.521004529947	... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience.
0.0	0.244999590056	So, your original question is the right question.
0.0	0.395239636959	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.627002451691	Like, I'm standing here, I -- I watched the video of Senator Cruz.
0.0	0.282185781022	And we have to stop all the divisions.
0.0	0.346504645229	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.557334035926	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.277584173518	But...
0.0	0.584184799533	What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the Muslim nations in that region who are going to have to fight and defend their way of life.
0.0	0.700118923996	I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of State, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now.
0.0	0.282554168201	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.371848405962	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.
0.0	0.270272961729	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.492742029209	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.404297922234	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.20127668319	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.583586712694	We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels.
0.0	0.510830313524	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.361469476093	And for my part, I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has.
0.0	0.280167263838	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.28809037136	I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out.
1.0	0.455296614028	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.38408899729	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.264009835386	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.604865267286	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.542741281848	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.310393355954	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.41797718422	I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.
0.0	0.273545898132	We were wrong.
0.0	0.237087216986	That's what the political revolution is about.
0.0	0.602016510791	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.696840636316	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.239370731878	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.628898204234	They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.
0.0	0.625503118137	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.31295614812	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.277546553333	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.

0.0	0.266606687985	I think you're --
0.0	0.262170730849	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.457886619007	And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.
0.0	0.265855534433	That makes no sense at all.

0.0	0.274069632317	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.575458977265	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.261727626209	That's not fair.

0.0	0.660652465017	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.618599003488	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.601629226684	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.447462917539	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.400683884451	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.478144153739	We end up paying the highest prices in the world.
0.0	0.238811972643	Not good.

0.0	0.263055199688	They'll all come back.
0.0	0.272709980085	So it's unfair to say in total...
0.0	0.625932796928	And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.
0.0	0.409715340171	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.691783331717	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.633849367803	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.277475104933	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.515494302312	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.422029161309	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.274445991329	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
1.0	0.276813198582	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.519030990268	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
0.0	0.311368047528	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.698241418713	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.285453721082	Yeah.
0.0	0.673918933051	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.395924328435	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.348558647395	Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.714830291036	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.285454964281	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.602097494447	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.482158913133	I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.
0.0	0.35526555419	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.524203451869	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.70777499521	And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.
0.0	0.246599517865	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.277249898986	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.549176969191	But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
0.0	0.346140838668	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.701202943657	When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.
0.0	0.282720650997	We now finally are where we need to be.
0.0	0.253198222807	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.327397904559	David, let me give you a little bit of background here.
0.0	0.410054886498	He's actually a negative force.
0.0	0.368287819961	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.60931679679	And so people are still going to get health care, thankfully, in emergency rooms, in hospitals.
0.0	0.676544594591	You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down.
0.0	0.320629956034	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.34296145998	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
0.0	0.270972809524	We have losers.
0.0	0.546151589782	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.262462868589	They have no choice.
0.0	0.338506264371	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.401645568298	I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.507753467967	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.
0.0	0.61620526529	Well, we did have a plan, and I think it's fair to say that of all of the Arab leaders, Gaddafi probably had more blood on his hands of Americans than anybody else.
0.0	0.267139239624	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.710764291495	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
0.0	0.723880280532	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.720209862404	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.311307100968	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.38361129068	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.331332346806	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.261679796468	This is absolutely absurd.
0.0	0.622144493161	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.433151259829	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.333305555116	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.256714968363	Neil...
0.0	0.33292561331	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.491267552777	You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.
0.0	0.307845468201	I want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, which they have not been doing.
0.0	0.662136850088	We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.
0.0	0.513329242204	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.352777750085	You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.
0.0	0.285330730658	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.411488678288	It has too much economic power.
1.0	0.754631833004	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
1.0	0.385353951587	When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.711524072302	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.644613877874	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.609114871658	So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.
0.0	0.426038876818	It was...
0.0	0.376252056322	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.722618349741	And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.
0.0	0.272822644008	Well, they're glitches because...
0.0	0.614805499628	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.488058349901	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.315596480414	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.602721251326	We have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as General Dempsey said.
0.0	0.401667353641	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.56807414781	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.273154360186	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.635003037024	I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college.
0.0	0.5	I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party's nominee.
0.0	0.329760480363	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.248475843219	Everybody got out -- and they kept our equipment.
0.0	0.363931637716	And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a -- that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.
0.0	0.631801511348	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.490718205022	I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria.
0.0	0.309869084065	Well, sure.
0.0	0.579322301314	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.277395182729	So, in terms of refugees, I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe, with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that, of course, we reach out.
0.0	0.152645267585	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.72057542976	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.64875072248	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.611190221196	Or a young woman who had been performing at President Obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member.
0.0	0.547711588844	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.699101323652	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.403549999071	But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting.
0.0	0.54408859278	We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.
0.0	0.631913006536	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
0.0	0.479582100082	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.539402766819	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.277097864319	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.209068775733	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.262210869503	That's the difference.
0.0	0.261696550618	He's very upset.
0.0	0.268050733829	Secretary Clinton also said we -- it was not just the invasion of Iraq which Secretary Clinton voted for and has since said was a big mistake -- and, indeed, it was.
0.0	0.379602995792	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.260343545322	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.267146720746	You know, Ted didn't show up.
1.0	0.718889802434	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.598397527656	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.436563876926	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.442899667396	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.514126262055	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.
0.0	0.454992005444	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.421907769473	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.335389339155	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.397865974393	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.549025938619	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.661505543142	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.703717639106	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.298867937846	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.23592695924	Got to be on the floor of the Senate.
1.0	0.571872386912	But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.
0.0	0.223373743088	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.600239687079	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.595563393187	Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top.
0.0	0.243565017706	Right.
0.0	0.361032011321	Support community banks and credit unions.
0.0	0.722541676192	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.
0.0	0.709606702163	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.277578986518	...
0.0	0.218287188142	Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.
0.0	0.140361861106	So we have a disagreement on this.
1.0	0.70391355765	According to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.317636973566	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.25566543882	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.57399193499	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.441951057759	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.243565017706	Right?
0.0	0.26374144382	He's very charming.
0.0	0.284377022585	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.312367416096	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.588304125232	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.205777473603	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.286860061925	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.413698006825	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.
0.0	0.572990412731	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.461640002311	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.426472629504	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.281178393549	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.545172420562	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.471484203457	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.277572410265	Divide that out.
0.0	0.360811209855	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.643270362254	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.666814772838	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.289375954812	A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.
0.0	0.654576185993	So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.
0.0	0.730572164903	I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.
0.0	0.566426791877	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.289906381561	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.638701446559	We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.
0.0	0.66217643544	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.598616050132	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.302847193981	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.380159734316	It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible.
0.0	0.394184077467	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.274455847646	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.392615683779	Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
0.0	0.452959727999	Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense.
1.0	0.452954781986	We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.671544965857	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.314867493986	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.353380711266	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.19610318808	I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.677779262498	Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.
0.0	0.624727240081	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.484419834817	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.658997091406	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.686496622785	You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.
0.0	0.320103481813	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.221930194153	It's what they call it.
0.0	0.221572017987	You get a lot of them that are overrated.
0.0	0.298452676083	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.484625968357	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.403855344825	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.28433427721	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.191510290843	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.231361876869	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.309103952545	If they want to accept our values and our laws.
0.0	0.574669732891	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.281323844794	Check it out.
0.0	0.295405674866	... ground and air.
1.0	0.649971438248	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.303928345155	Folks, it's not too late.
0.0	0.556803586685	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.547424191311	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.409711067073	You have a problem with ISIS.
0.0	0.250778513557	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.274813602767	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.385042915657	Please become part of the political revolution.
0.0	0.649936991002	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.426084321376	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.209868781074	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.556586039353	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.477536865679	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.259328946422	Yes.
0.0	0.309520234598	We needed 60.
0.0	0.221542215596	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.436108856202	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.273545898132	They were wrong.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.638239031324	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.535425620831	But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.
0.0	0.306727936522	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.266465682204	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
0.0	0.247628309357	But Secretary Clinton is wrong.
0.0	0.266936030824	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.413985047592	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.612408094443	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.533818745907	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.564525503535	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
0.0	0.253123271241	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.280586572573	We've gotten off the Hillary's e-mails, good.
0.0	0.282389962182	Can I just say this...
0.0	0.276948792721	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.292138944067	I need your help.
0.0	0.714342949406	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.
0.0	0.261931465577	They're a scam.
0.0	0.291938551672	This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.
0.0	0.52874430191	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.68583214526	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.452966320565	... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do.
0.0	0.521108044988	All of that together, we're going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.
0.0	0.592564909014	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.43946373444	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.668349413303	We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.
0.0	0.70772520168	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.443570017945	But it was also the cascading effects that followed that.
0.0	0.321091348416	The central question in this race is trust.
0.0	0.335153302233	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.323204090675	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.216252054763	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.240697696783	I think this is a very difficult issue.
0.0	0.448955749139	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.515043665343	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.40747179308	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.443691243321	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.319395693935	Okay, thank you.
0.0	0.48675588048	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.547538571274	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.643551034855	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.463621437507	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.608564945364	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.365008463322	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.721098691455	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.595433671378	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.
0.0	0.480151315299	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.162083458577	DICKERSON: A question from Kathie Obradovich.
0.0	0.547343755137	When somebody is addicted and seeking help, they should not have to wait three, four months in order to get that help.
0.0	0.593149858916	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.455858137937	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.55543968858	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.377397973768	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.717279422139	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.263776861878	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.387421020319	And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.
0.0	0.646389686874	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.697087073505	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.
1.0	0.320241578553	And some of them are like third world countries.
0.0	0.307137780171	Doctors are quitting.
0.0	0.599093270243	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.
0.0	0.606996940381	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.720413845383	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.608191735912	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.60728669177	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.535851403685	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.271839151179	They wanted Boeing's secrets.
0.0	0.344482418257	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.292399591725	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.26367213872	He's weak on immigration.
0.0	0.606834443076	You can -- you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.
0.0	0.392398791998	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.477360977864	We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.
0.0	0.294318040761	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.346388117582	And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.
0.0	0.417439904524	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.276858745861	I didn't.
0.0	0.616251421694	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.261666742671	... not everybody else.
0.0	0.297943237487	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.449284235753	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.457263953661	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.396640470007	So -- because we got to make the country rich.
0.0	0.698491370793	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.28144832776	And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.
0.0	0.313586242495	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.671653336416	It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.
0.0	0.287063017868	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.56502723771	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.335338824835	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.490998204328	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.265872696012	But let's be clear.
0.0	0.284990741764	Number two, we had a really good plan.
0.0	0.261964852196	I'm really rich.
0.0	0.281174968593	We need, basically, to pledge that we're going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.
0.0	0.555112306606	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.717291182363	We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
0.0	0.262464890074	The answer is no.
0.0	0.26968632989	I don't think anyone has a magical solution.
0.0	0.454891412965	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.591247272746	... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.
0.0	0.222547495086	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.276599458224	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.239423614661	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.229118513086	You don't hear it from anybody else.
0.0	0.558724090142	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.524248853523	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.450789048517	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.551989419476	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.350151678011	I'll give you another example.
0.0	0.725269053026	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.32177760832	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
0.0	0.310152418389	For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check.
0.0	0.44027636389	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.708090345542	There's too much -- it's like -- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
0.0	0.241141794532	They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work.
0.0	0.556758706958	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.647812079186	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.515816445264	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.305707183454	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.653102024761	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.55096086588	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
0.0	0.256664169203	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
0.0	0.16037607671	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.285607609616	We talked about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.344715501579	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.670994840137	So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has.
0.0	0.296768321959	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.660116563839	But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.
0.0	0.265876525222	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.550025200558	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.353808893103	They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.602880020564	So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.
1.0	0.732442060651	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.30800784449	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.367203755129	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.274225559879	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.708157072014	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.285453721082	Yeah.
0.0	0.550087799162	Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope.
0.0	0.667178175355	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.377425696506	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.266394755969	John.
0.0	0.334471268552	Now, it's very interesting.
0.0	0.597483828554	And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.
0.0	0.515268584991	See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together.
0.0	0.489873212637	Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
0.0	0.314573779871	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.455991114939	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.266197609944	This is a complicated issue.
0.0	0.35572567631	We must able to work collaboratively with others.
0.0	0.442716829735	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.18519946036	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.605488849793	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.
0.0	0.41435521233	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
0.0	0.630259620274	I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks.
0.0	0.646478564305	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.431498567061	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.371997095049	Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.236631895142	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.58351766004	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.454916687927	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.550738065548	I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.
0.0	0.434467618463	It was against Assad.
0.0	0.275161447487	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.242142624559	Let me...
0.0	0.209988647117	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.544414619929	Now, our country needs -- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
0.0	0.24816561069	See?
0.0	0.343436484958	And that's what I will do as your president.
0.0	0.306455976829	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
1.0	0.562970092373	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.259328946422	Yes.
0.0	0.251071466805	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.552458426359	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.264606137771	My plan is there.
0.0	0.269672187568	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.261687976539	That's American citizenship.
0.0	0.636647542414	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.288896491324	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.277264495353	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.288504671276	You want to know why things don't get done in Washington?
0.0	0.505696050568	That is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.
0.0	0.575898694798	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.541794225002	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.68859316874	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.528254957113	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.546928872972	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy.
0.0	0.307596425695	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.289172226267	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
0.0	0.258243114094	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.396042677702	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.672848240054	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.692652831974	The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...
0.0	0.279740458933	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.
0.0	0.335889840937	They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.
0.0	0.426038876818	I do.
0.0	0.242241620465	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.410395670206	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.686274083772	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.219383742957	...the only reason is -- look...
0.0	0.380126638194	My daughters went to college on a mountain of bills.
0.0	0.27089040306	It won't happen.
0.0	0.214140302394	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.486558280328	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.673115366783	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.631907251232	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.328977423377	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.470199127602	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.611803566366	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
1.0	0.623646636194	And the overall message is that it doesn't result in job loss.
0.0	0.550253634081	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
1.0	0.401260042802	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.272485549469	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.263018062255	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.275251286077	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.30176162726	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.328501190168	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.69152139595	And I'll tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign.
0.0	0.590732420599	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.720717904916	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.633501977292	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.697232560208	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.51576811378	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.69818130998	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.535145746705	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.657562032939	Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.396801351049	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.520260292825	And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.
0.0	0.748030996465	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.184403260336	She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship.
0.0	0.439024208786	We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...
0.0	0.359224837224	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.5	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.379833998004	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.5	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.642829151117	But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.
0.0	0.463999785348	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.28687625065	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.334988920672	I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.
1.0	0.74663327232	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.646938663137	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.310759531102	There's been no crowd like this.
0.0	0.25888460571	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.564829404679	As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
0.0	0.557955474782	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.510557002889	The United States has, unfortunately, been victimized by terrorism going back decades.
0.0	0.59313621459	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.562013964638	We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.
0.0	0.692221291373	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.426038876818	I have.
0.0	0.490523569817	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.608110018382	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.707102406035	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.578568814757	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.480087224391	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.445836716324	And, of course, I met the mothers of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, and Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and so many of them who have lost their children.
0.0	0.315096170224	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.277553933881	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.292351350562	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.279849563386	You know why three?
0.0	0.585767874755	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.291737628138	That's right.
0.0	0.260177245837	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.65992100865	Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin.
1.0	0.696771268479	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.5	If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.
0.0	0.386821418744	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.718376697412	We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that's what's keeping him contained.
0.0	0.383984195891	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.247971308945	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.470106921064	We have to go after what is called the shadow banking industry.
0.0	0.242787461767	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.666852187166	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.299519614069	Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world.
0.0	0.715943677957	$2.5 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world.
0.0	0.38798524338	Seventeen more million more people have health care.
0.0	0.416709102356	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.701076307658	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.442912350415	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.281075038372	Martha, if I may...
0.0	0.485629984367	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.688242584314	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.
0.0	0.702486833175	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.537342803009	We have the U.N. Security Council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path.
0.0	0.440457408933	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.35561335639	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.314343387039	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.568655976228	Please go to hillaryclinton.com and be part of making this country what we know it can and should be.
0.0	0.5	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.194282883852	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.285106498478	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.643671663446	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.45168099323	I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.
0.0	0.5	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.216372034224	I gotta do it, Dad.
0.0	0.264096869612	I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?
0.0	0.435440336996	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.376560131459	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.198292385794	No, Martha, I would not.
0.0	0.3524106901	I think that is the number one requirement.
0.0	0.396240812433	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.273838208588	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.485767215374	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.35559786325	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.277295299687	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.277584173518	No.
0.0	0.289011417617	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.767967707977	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.266075918891	OK.
0.0	0.278238199328	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.243421464525	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.524289115287	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.724500304008	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.375804442217	The people don't work for us.
0.0	0.285744629888	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.315792898893	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.344372473652	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.288585363698	People that know me, like me.
0.0	0.510963809098	And America's best days are in front of us if we move forward together.
0.0	0.242157433729	We need to know who our neighbors are.
1.0	0.627023252148	John -- John, this country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.715133683007	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.308078837906	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.275942793996	I never said that.
0.0	0.245261134706	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.629635030474	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.428785040387	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.644848560922	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
0.0	0.663379185766	In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
0.0	0.262152216676	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.245384265701	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.266348091159	So, so important.
0.0	0.191452306372	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.253767055763	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.341375218444	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.518803727751	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.563381105658	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.270622388449	They knew that.
0.0	0.279262201962	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.557199378274	Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day.
0.0	0.372739640723	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.
0.0	0.597378681365	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.538793850135	My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.
1.0	0.72028213807	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.693745787009	And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.
0.0	0.212735400531	Look what they did in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.287719901519	He cut and run.
0.0	0.320980731364	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.623036057824	So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
0.0	0.358102597703	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.297636004145	And those countries who are opposed to Islam, they are going to have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today.
0.0	0.289371007798	I changed that.
0.0	0.25860358525	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.508298111613	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.482152688907	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.710217956909	So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out.
0.0	0.217407120747	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.308197037642	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.19872124313	That's not the America that I think we should be.
0.0	0.633949893681	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.261381687918	Now, I understand that this is very difficult.
0.0	0.266763044411	We got nothing but problems.
0.0	0.5	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.300576379887	Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild.
0.0	0.306302073433	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.206620496403	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.302939875803	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.641254780057	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.314232184377	We have made some good progress.
0.0	0.563365891169	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.157008648499	That's who I'm indebted to.
0.0	0.594073445516	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.72272237381	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.262945850206	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.287843190943	He'll say.
0.0	0.306324342796	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.580639623409	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
1.0	0.563922559649	What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons.
0.0	0.614950249434	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.287632334366	So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.
0.0	0.284305906859	All of us believe climate change is real.
0.0	0.24910920272	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.304023063015	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.392993479415	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.472837096549	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.311889104899	If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship.
0.0	0.207939358815	And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.
0.0	0.650764611566	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
0.0	0.247799355893	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.415749627349	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.51538962447	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.257393157527	I know the overrated ones.
0.0	0.71585614969	Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.283923161828	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.30167890187	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.
0.0	0.449584318266	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.505788677061	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.257075400977	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.474694243503	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
1.0	0.706770028347	Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world.
0.0	0.571463164944	What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people.
0.0	0.550571073785	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.506697168569	And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.
0.0	0.331163592258	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.302479307011	And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.
0.0	0.471974564705	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.
0.0	0.273236309903	You do legislation.
0.0	0.283177854883	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.318627497785	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.25022213705	We know about the French.
0.0	0.518129364658	You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying.
0.0	0.303598835793	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.340295182172	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.464310454862	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.254236035506	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.661855798851	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.231178097144	Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.277578986518	...
0.0	0.257306102706	It is a tragedy all over this country.
0.0	0.333235497684	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.318032691244	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.708684789968	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.698218793873	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.327383921015	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.267235922994	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.266134733406	Absolutely.
0.0	0.434467618463	And here's why.
0.0	0.623988240456	I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video.
0.0	0.355010271675	I am not the candidate of Wall Street...
0.0	0.372687637008	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.36355603738	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.273161168675	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.545059357789	I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis.
0.0	0.331288466871	The DNC has hired vendors.
0.0	0.590189191082	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.23327148426	Everybody should.
0.0	0.679259540604	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.31748633763	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.309226604573	We saw what happened in Egypt.
0.0	0.301245119241	No, both the federal and a state approach.
0.0	0.284759559449	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
1.0	0.270547767218	They stole it.
0.0	0.382399177666	It was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up.
1.0	0.487877776191	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.248663769501	I think he is right.
0.0	0.263528502496	And we are not England.
0.0	0.274918191902	Oh, great.
0.0	0.263030718185	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.379104433996	And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth.
0.0	0.662806770418	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.272690954757	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.267904621546	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.292608096798	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.481811107056	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.581284875436	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.677171655218	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.289271053603	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.308508212641	Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us.
0.0	0.579162113785	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.655315858247	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.722964140894	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.359649507437	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.266765409946	That's just media stuff.
0.0	0.572091955282	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.244780653545	Both served.
0.0	0.288183944633	I like them.
0.0	0.277492791283	You can do both.
0.0	0.270528835864	Think of it.
0.0	0.311833049938	It was a different situation in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.272841866506	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.334787311861	May I respond?
0.0	0.5	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.631121996043	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.362104969656	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.464790655415	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.330293946584	Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.
0.0	0.684567467632	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.717748965704	The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.
0.0	0.252788162102	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.37335602197	Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.689416579303	When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it.
0.0	0.257624892373	Yes, exactly, exactly.
1.0	0.458275078957	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.337597499054	We need to figure this out together.
0.0	0.248888565883	I have a problem with that, Martha.
0.0	0.451764827614	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.375061055025	And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce's great story.
0.0	0.359224968	We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government.
0.0	0.473152108854	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.625091633857	And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring.
0.0	0.228953616484	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.262522562779	But you know what?
0.0	0.703683555587	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.277630572817	That can be done.
0.0	0.375012487263	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.
0.0	0.610991956998	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.317373408924	As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.253347354168	I voted against the war.
0.0	0.548828475632	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.337885225218	Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico.
0.0	0.317016888968	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.293716648327	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.333735736033	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.246280652691	You're right about that.
0.0	0.262522562779	And you know what?
0.0	0.26732899365	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.712509084067	... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region.
0.0	0.252720403988	That's kind of a no-brainer.
0.0	0.417331516796	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.231715460018	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.474550854721	And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
0.0	0.285330730658	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.248104463392	It's not a bestseller.
0.0	0.620656197345	And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.
0.0	0.671004282644	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.314459878131	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.263590795577	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.557970441624	This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along.
0.0	0.320216006718	There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out.
0.0	0.2709490062	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.547438489592	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.
0.0	0.656803853957	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.345442344291	That means medical.
0.0	0.600478227585	You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that.
0.0	0.277584173518	No.
0.0	0.5	That's it.
0.0	0.400474504482	But I have another one, Ford.
0.0	0.319719346672	How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
0.0	0.649079816156	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.42429432584	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.340776050691	That's a hard road to walk.
0.0	0.30368695192	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.26519101272	They're going to build in Mexico.
0.0	0.310812152643	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.277940010869	It's real estate.
0.0	0.235233238681	But you don't hear that from anybody else.
0.0	0.30690014047	But it cannot be an American fight.
0.0	0.55384073717	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
0.0	0.413191163809	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.5	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.279782167623	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.509251687832	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.297633756496	... first of all...
0.0	0.67224875356	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.329934705292	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.290900328216	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.
0.0	0.509537567577	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.323328102196	Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.
0.0	0.289517858854	Hillary doesn't want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her.
0.0	0.296038679868	We can build the fence.
0.0	0.292667703659	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.266756295887	Don't know that.
0.0	0.246045019029	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.372103463955	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.67656344663	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.295102461467	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.243565017706	Right.
0.0	0.327656851326	But people have to be alert.
0.0	0.686569536744	I saw Ted Cruz say, "we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill."
0.0	0.266134733406	Absolutely.
0.0	0.721691071027	We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America.
0.0	0.696472248304	We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.
0.0	0.277986716153	Never support.
0.0	0.556731118223	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.299340085261	So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
0.0	0.249505826712	Did she do a great job?
0.0	0.252877368162	It's affordable for everybody.
0.0	0.696420872284	And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world.
0.0	0.300538740079	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.49375285977	I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization.
0.0	0.272457358886	You really can't.
0.0	0.282125745591	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.243428519698	It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state.
0.0	0.279383837441	You're right.
0.0	0.671118189937	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.456186610219	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.305578922381	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.225277904822	We don't want to be Sweden.
0.0	0.262548168755	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.
0.0	0.443905061706	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.37384223551	The intelligence was by no means absolute.
0.0	0.72469235441	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.329911810958	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.302534744787	They have to be alert to problems.
0.0	0.214712439423	Please reconsider, I'll say no.
0.0	0.437889421029	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.434467618463	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.488780847559	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.258479933391	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.280148631307	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.635796502063	Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
0.0	0.245810745819	Oh, yes there is.
0.0	0.333653725518	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.617925531129	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.258171813372	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.697512757391	First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.197091810273	I've always listened to you, Megyn.
0.0	0.370884348638	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.659793639759	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.697707869303	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.663264001171	And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms.
0.0	0.42748044166	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.289149150871	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
0.0	0.340902705952	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
0.0	0.277312094478	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
0.0	0.433864622153	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.467520895996	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.261693038838	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.305213249544	I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment.
0.0	0.586391891122	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.67666664864	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
1.0	0.719019970364	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
0.0	0.696654389561	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.231722853745	...Chris...
0.0	0.453516160036	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
0.0	0.662881242924	But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you.
0.0	0.467805131375	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.249652890118	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.373863966172	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.567587412155	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.537564177053	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.483426430762	You learn to create a security cabinet.
0.0	0.231685265012	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.620224932353	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.578452888201	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.341656777407	A military island.
0.0	0.427370155482	I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.
0.0	0.275609473732	I got that.
0.0	0.625493802963	And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues.
0.0	0.58616635881	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
1.0	0.562130942554	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.697575776625	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.
0.0	0.27696305992	My point is this.
0.0	0.532366965307	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.231171704895	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.253490409834	Look--
0.0	0.404763246645	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.272662125708	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.456879083391	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.271310824501	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.248892893358	They don't know how to bring it about.
0.0	0.290445301364	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.
0.0	0.580773679684	So it was not against ISIS, it was against -- it was against Assad.
0.0	0.420605353939	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.383744513065	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.
0.0	0.719835684692	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.
0.0	0.318540809635	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.699088724266	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.482085748007	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.669622637555	Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer.
0.0	0.249815226611	I had to borrow money to go to school.
1.0	0.391791989689	The 500,000 who came home with PTSD, and traumatic brain injury.
0.0	0.460763642923	So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly.
0.0	0.428544666299	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
0.0	0.283166364871	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
1.0	0.789749230408	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
0.0	0.713178619868	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.671029505838	I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider.
0.0	0.537452382599	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.599340237598	But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that.
0.0	0.265742371112	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.260666645699	Look, I served on...
1.0	0.768632474082	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.286806476575	The Turks are being threatened.
0.0	0.434038268724	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.278690059318	I love the Saudis.
0.0	0.51716024136	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.655461658994	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.665584878873	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.680856132251	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.274781558662	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.355332616264	When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.
0.0	0.702757439358	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.667405020808	And I think that's a mistake, and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways.
0.0	0.606513772251	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.323306267562	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.694250890543	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.24616290761	But I was born here.
0.0	0.492173919816	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.21797959745	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.55330640144	And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.
0.0	0.612071571746	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.5	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.245926129188	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.714621042491	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.314973871311	It cannot solely be America's fight.
0.0	0.508459683934	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.261859860706	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.672875554863	If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration.
0.0	0.542712784119	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
1.0	0.73378980099	They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
0.0	0.580820747685	He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing?
0.0	0.289427836529	Not assets."
0.0	0.698018243369	And also -- also, what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health care outcomes are not necessarily that good.
0.0	0.589518942331	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.301566077781	They can provide resources.
0.0	0.5	The no-fly zone, I would hope, would be also shared by Russia.
0.0	0.699355699601	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.348817411486	Bret, we're just starting.
0.0	0.288944630235	I didn't say permanently.
1.0	0.353811082128	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.27629103107	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.
0.0	0.330111724056	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.294323594519	Break them up.
0.0	0.376588096263	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.360840571686	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.353265141621	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.643386712876	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.347274526173	That's the right of people.
0.0	0.217348385979	Again, with all do respect to Secretary Clinton...
0.0	0.202648646542	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.621388688435	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.181109622206	I think they'd want to hear it.
0.0	0.702516678817	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.251315502414	That is an egregious act.
0.0	0.306563423508	You know, on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign, I was in Keene, and I was asked what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?
0.0	0.267822969578	It's hate action.
0.0	0.536189356458	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.266756295887	He didn't know.
0.0	0.17486442309	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.690372024832	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.364303599856	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.261987994625	Then (inaudible)...
0.0	0.25268600652	Because now he's going a little bit better.
1.0	0.55843025197	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.529628481554	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.3151451575	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.288372898043	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.245453661793	He's a progressive economist.
0.0	0.668112464693	And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.560135437766	A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this.
0.0	0.248635564566	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.337063913292	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.269346978742	It's a joke.
0.0	0.351439080347	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
1.0	0.521512947879	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.275345799179	I've prosecuted terrorists.
0.0	0.4517716103	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
1.0	0.692029593319	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
0.0	0.517738201096	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.339760462766	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
1.0	0.40069098274	And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph).
0.0	0.650670920854	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.357233624278	... saying, no middle class tax raises.
0.0	0.44069847328	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.434467618463	What do we do?
0.0	0.423154038694	But if you place good ones, you pocket it.
0.0	0.665938376459	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.707106500234	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.327849324545	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.524147969993	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.272230407554	I know, Bret.
0.0	0.379803062689	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.519034349286	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.621932889912	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.301610569366	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.632707044815	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.24752208807	And I hear their speeches.
0.0	0.59113842151	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.5	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
1.0	0.295210756262	They built a hotel.
0.0	0.608402551119	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.382910504123	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.359333669635	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.253164970013	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.
0.0	0.28774087739	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.318454575394	... people all over this country -- not you, Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other.
0.0	0.255903841001	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
0.0	0.410138227298	Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.446625489418	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.648746442882	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.59967508021	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.271453846349	I don't care.
0.0	0.277575826247	Thank you.
0.0	0.587838506094	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.287388321276	That's true.
0.0	0.714147659452	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.677221836461	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.534630174929	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.335917638313	But states need to do more as well.
0.0	0.25280112109	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.406090727698	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.262170682297	This is an emergency.
0.0	0.245768340624	It's coming from more than Mexico.
0.0	0.521947249943	So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.
0.0	0.631319824483	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.555840826362	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.342222124534	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.657144747522	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.377840788948	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.217860769803	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.454424489716	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.321335303663	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.33721504461	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.698603481251	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.463494303934	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.386884475754	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.5	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.306085053549	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.261721182162	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.264064853569	That's not true.
0.0	0.549825607324	You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super PAC and they're advertising against me in Iowa as we speak.
0.0	0.628321603622	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
0.0	0.692359627721	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.302726438284	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.295848823852	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.258296269199	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.507782159654	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.245645851076	I have to tell you.
0.0	0.357631167567	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.290625675066	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.290850831993	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.423903557495	Now I'm not doing that...I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?
0.0	0.290800723492	Ted can change his mind.
0.0	0.554293005501	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.297870601116	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.29103301727	You can change your mind.
0.0	0.557098918691	No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.
0.0	0.517475275136	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.401977864089	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.59335033915	The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.
0.0	0.599189319704	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?
0.0	0.264904792648	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.307450965636	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.543791987255	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.562337093468	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.267311649815	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.601849819067	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.71884775172	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
1.0	0.283862523594	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.674163331443	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.486350462615	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.282482095986	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.556894642789	And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, "if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed.
0.0	0.556739691915	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.518078546529	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.443370256662	Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers.
0.0	0.583399856227	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.272485549469	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.33102434044	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.595574740246	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.620256271507	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.596149854776	When those buildings came down, she was trapped in her building and I didn't hear from her over six hours.
0.0	0.390044321116	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.261348492551	Go ahead.
0.0	0.349691625931	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.379204712842	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.694231795955	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.362193296983	... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
0.0	0.728544408986	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.274993487391	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.264656726582	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.683441537654	Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.
0.0	0.252256542384	I said, "They send it back?"
0.0	0.339617089765	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.575014273679	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.235350295794	Did a couple of cataract surgeries over Christmas holidays.
0.0	0.300820451507	That's a wonderful business model.
0.0	0.405707908333	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.42156716597	When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.70654124246	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.253199949461	The worker's out of a job.
1.0	0.730298758474	In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship.
0.0	0.266961921837	They think they are.
0.0	0.687119519547	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.352896873654	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.21129625325	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.586399638402	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.635295345669	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.183364254092	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.416295787602	ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.
0.0	0.330500865078	Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem.
0.0	0.273249080269	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.242786980284	We've been at this a couple of years.
0.0	0.279383837441	You're right.
0.0	0.266360967034	She said the truth.
0.0	0.330885232617	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.601725419643	And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.
0.0	0.319887715905	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.289035216946	There will be a process.
0.0	0.280135440161	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.319641825912	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.277680336928	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.242039489304	When do we beat Mexico at the border?
0.0	0.400101644898	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.333646475935	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.62352231964	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.315676551143	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.691353398774	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
0.0	0.450079648322	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.556731776274	So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.
0.0	0.344211568625	He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
0.0	0.54722776592	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.433568723338	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.646932978387	And, also, acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration, and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners.
0.0	0.218436680703	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.684179661481	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
1.0	0.678525108796	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.610407480462	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.53170546825	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.664963543504	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.573360599703	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.277985122763	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
1.0	0.761494302292	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.280140117228	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.36055470571	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.301173330799	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.453876030242	Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy.
0.0	0.605514426474	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.643206276915	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.411622470871	But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.
0.0	0.647697894713	The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.
0.0	0.363268885242	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.358417338875	No, I've never made a promise like that.
0.0	0.246396584126	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.259328946422	Yes.
0.0	0.375445559791	I think that what we're facing with ISIS is especially complicated.
0.0	0.531674512001	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.398990204781	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
1.0	0.28441069506	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
0.0	0.526557421291	I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out.

0.0	0.490931085627	We didn't win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America.
0.0	0.3556026432	And we also need a cheerleader.
0.0	0.650743272081	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.645975525769	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.

0.0	0.697441699159	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.243565017706	Right.
0.0	0.376581038761	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.

0.0	0.632884562808	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.331249077899	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.205961833138	So be very, very careful.
0.0	0.305802017546	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.275274571508	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.460086823438	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.297692627621	So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe.
0.0	0.458905122849	And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow.
0.0	0.465886256959	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.27437139418	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.696548781505	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.510632580075	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.586512204696	According to the economists -- who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying -- that $24 trillion -- we're very close -- that's the point of no return.
0.0	0.479433279588	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.390299785577	This entire question was an attack, but that's (inaudible)
0.0	0.282086232741	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.357210036402	This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.
0.0	0.727666255304	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.548359807002	And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
0.0	0.281599505995	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.703421920492	And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.262439284581	I happen to think...
0.0	0.302738602666	He just writes out an order, executive order.
1.0	0.626275518123	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.371855165218	When you come back to me, I'll share that story.
0.0	0.288519667105	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.377557588458	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.348350777931	We have people out of work.

0.0	0.319861964338	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
1.0	0.720473648151	I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer.
0.0	0.322575579489	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
0.0	0.613345629233	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.380958478788	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.

0.0	0.263483456891	Chris, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.5	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.630622613173	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.214589949989	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.584464961747	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.700696902859	And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.
0.0	0.245864425868	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.380265794858	We both made the identical promises.
0.0	0.29705723568	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.

0.0	0.608810429727	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.693379154972	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.260567486523	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.586395424977	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.

0.0	0.487694054314	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.277578986518	...
0.0	0.431457480053	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.435256392078	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.699702176217	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.713659643913	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.369910395939	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.42323820763	Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions?
0.0	0.525040283708	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.679961652384	Furthermore, in a competitive global economy, it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world.
0.0	0.633774455469	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.674039687087	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.236102097314	We want to build on it and fix it.
0.0	0.271066071009	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.231474101867	I say, "That's a terrible story.
0.0	0.550258950336	So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.
0.0	0.522832859817	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.281969874916	They've become rich.
0.0	0.361429168971	Well, I think it's pretty clear that they know that I will.
0.0	0.466025384415	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.485373821919	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.606936891962	Now, you'd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me?
0.0	0.23070709942	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.
0.0	0.221296772924	You should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition.

0.0	0.373322312184	Seventy percent of our population lives bi-coastally).
0.0	0.603133255018	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.453989670812	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.440452677561	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
0.0	0.307131446275	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.54129488307	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.545268321156	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.327943123541	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.54586896214	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.295004689213	We can have debt-free college in the United States.
0.0	0.34560874596	We need much more than that.
0.0	0.261877150184	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.243565017706	Right.
0.0	0.320357994756	Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble.
0.0	0.590750160154	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.516049337298	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.52411020073	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
0.0	0.593365949441	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.257481424594	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.587895226736	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.561475575427	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.294798948791	Sadly, the American dream is dead.
0.0	0.627157016629	We have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information.
1.0	0.571461220469	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.386555751156	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.628821912901	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.432957692831	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.261496911451	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.269138815336	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.696194481753	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
0.0	0.631172844587	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.331074477768	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.370203683254	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.309415994347	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.29347547904	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.364912830291	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.245142238407	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.43505781182	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.621941261318	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.
0.0	0.527449346547	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.224459893597	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.275587834496	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.693837186795	And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.
0.0	0.168864840656	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.245417400163	And Martha...
0.0	0.582210572242	Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable?
0.0	0.347221081022	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.28508980044	And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem.
0.0	0.282885142753	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.601220534746	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
1.0	0.459637761516	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.598392876816	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.273447857028	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.344763857626	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
0.0	0.379690556193	Eleven points, to be exact.

0.0	0.269175197136	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
1.0	0.589165656974	Twenty-one mass shootings, including one last weekend in Des Moins where three were murdered.
0.0	0.597312245537	What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy, and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need.
0.0	0.363921951474	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.610521624553	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.67933081533	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.269352591588	Whoever heard of this?
0.0	0.29363350442	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.510265469834	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.245725593166	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.699404242214	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.280309968551	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.290897764209	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.701570380443	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
0.0	0.404070234977	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.560948995654	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.318733007793	Now, what does that mean?
0.0	0.260175628359	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.296370365133	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.282903478258	We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital.
0.0	0.470402249077	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.270205906846	He undermines it.
0.0	0.280081763923	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.315645460905	They will not.
0.0	0.69355884516	Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS.
1.0	0.527196027863	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.512632507488	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.253920179843	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.569590040814	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.259383786932	... but wait a minute...
0.0	0.301820560956	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.
0.0	0.607958528577	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.621459192534	I don't know and with all due respect to the secretary, Wall Street played by the rules?
0.0	0.556256103404	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.694995672566	And, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like Gadhafi, a despot with American blood on his hands, is overturned.
0.0	0.471348708524	We have to end -- education has to be local.
0.0	0.479517008717	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.
0.0	0.347671510593	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.237325833885	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.711622824912	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.151995817149	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.241861644306	Becky --

0.0	0.419117021082	David, there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees.
0.0	0.426092864021	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.42776558573	They make a billion dollars a day.
0.0	0.289185899903	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
0.0	0.270748991116	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
0.0	0.298277103492	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.248669566974	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.707428171968	And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.272300383217	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.

0.0	0.352563255351	Meanwhile, the rich get richer.
0.0	0.3016514504	And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.
0.0	0.701365166933	We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.
0.0	0.600223504231	I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support.
1.0	0.715223533869	Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof.
0.0	0.263465987894	I do respect Rand.
0.0	0.266134733406	Absolutely.
0.0	0.404833939288	Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
0.0	0.294741226919	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.686172571164	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
1.0	0.278004930036	They're bringing crime.
0.0	0.394023087106	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
1.0	0.597352936545	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
0.0	0.233886829633	On welfare.
0.0	0.717938303857	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.315462016475	Of course not.
0.0	0.25327026734	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.279850852219	But it will be...
0.0	0.331718323605	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.381189160345	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
0.0	0.26484776244	Looking forward to it.
0.0	0.263243375596	I have no idea.
0.0	0.393542368279	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.35561335639	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
1.0	0.829787728322	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.337399096776	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.38312906942	The business model of Wall Street is fraud.
0.0	0.295820546324	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.31486280166	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.545773759865	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.348778151156	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.680654703743	We have one House member from Vermont, three candidates in the race.
0.0	0.253987236095	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.
0.0	0.28500364306	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.

0.0	0.485614190255	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.211432829028	... who got us out of that...

0.0	0.658095011519	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.338758306594	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.645447585575	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.261931465577	They're a scam.
1.0	0.730702254974	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.329856820197	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.619763699222	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.434467618463	What should we do?
0.0	0.265096334473	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.545859548969	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.220727408126	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.37114645996	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.565875531159	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.312220239119	It is going to be amazingly destructive.
0.0	0.49287157143	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.295093145254	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.396317108395	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.237247277873	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.399440337779	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.72957105694	The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.
0.0	0.707037783007	Why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want?
0.0	0.672861097024	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.270806377559	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
0.0	0.280146312854	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.422068239588	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.227404926412	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.232350264962	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.383315465298	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.243595645405	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.597688181045	We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground.
0.0	0.26235475157	Again, Americans murdered.
0.0	0.253385387133	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.615877921447	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.686807200916	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.251054710308	We can't do it.
0.0	0.269161654168	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.262522562779	And you know what?
0.0	0.648952455498	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.490865470529	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.322249815942	Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.
0.0	0.678010059403	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.266075918891	OK?
0.0	0.145014917194	And I apologize to nobody for that.
0.0	0.382607564973	In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America.
0.0	0.59976000663	In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, "what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"
0.0	0.690502779513	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
0.0	0.704477265689	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.260971169692	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.573981635773	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.365546530056	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.642314462967	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.626223091699	So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act.
0.0	0.355507243074	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.365817356145	Our country doesn't win anymore.
1.0	0.695610640448	I lost that election by three percentage points.
0.0	0.616208504858	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.302034052058	He couldn't answer the question.
0.0	0.282350941014	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.513298657566	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.270972809524	We have losers.
0.0	0.348767245054	KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.
0.0	0.691606701244	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.603783424894	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.313487259096	She's the senator from New York.
0.0	0.274129541971	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.399344179705	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.256660336046	So they put together this.
0.0	0.427550367741	I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.
0.0	0.28333226511	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.296194131331	There has never been a jihadist group like this.
0.0	0.616049143826	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.351606839515	Because I've seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime.
0.0	0.206567606262	... Chris, your questions that you...
0.0	0.546240381811	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.368568396371	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.313737734073	Mark my words.
0.0	0.525838844713	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.493866370593	It's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement.
0.0	0.204671468927	If I was president, I'd say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.47988407566	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.653522008233	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.651587866933	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.262137926226	...before I go.
0.0	0.332467911091	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.554668552483	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.300541449786	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.347695335176	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.351725164616	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.562220414179	The United States must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.340659070167	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.277816610432	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.556751697117	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.530008946695	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.321989062919	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.676652260422	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.698155639021	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.284404954662	They would have to pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.365166560473	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.681330447976	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.297222110555	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.5	Jared (ph), Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family.
0.0	0.640804365613	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.262522562779	And you know what?
0.0	0.562821234053	You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.
0.0	0.442691989947	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.512421104145	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.43203621741	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.249710488102	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.662319724962	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.438383518472	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.38117725862	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.379655369557	I don't think the term is what's important.
0.0	0.601308600132	I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.
0.0	0.715515046808	By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started.
0.0	0.691812001175	There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction.
0.0	0.303053292523	And he asked me to support that.
0.0	0.555734559312	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.709606702163	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.718612710525	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.472716660205	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.541668943382	We're spending $80 billion locking people up, disproportionately Latino and African American.
0.0	0.245163773923	And there's a lot.
0.0	0.353657711731	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.383122468958	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.338953173964	... family leave for a very long time...
0.0	0.592611043927	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.307399735528	Let me just...
0.0	0.279850852219	I will do that.
0.0	0.394249987699	Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.
0.0	0.363472456749	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.492333751792	That is why I support a $12 national federal minimum wage.
0.0	0.18619232796	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.614160316099	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
0.0	0.556361887112	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.31467134477	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.721503678395	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.439230302149	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.
0.0	0.306477088675	And the U.S. chamber of commerce, which hardly ever says nice things about Democratic governors anywhere, named our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship.
0.0	0.474843144351	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.608467878804	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.262522562779	And you know what?
0.0	0.666532294615	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.301776759186	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.532842355661	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.225688296538	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.299321639013	This is what's made our nation so special.
0.0	0.319393372672	Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978.
0.0	0.23388062629	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.252663257005	And I watch the speeches.
0.0	0.329999018491	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.557632412186	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.444672308583	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.262520759915	I'll do it.
0.0	0.570219622697	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.337868912077	He believes everything he stands for.

1.0	0.73242838602	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.242062525764	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.383186943379	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.376917691388	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.365285477964	I made it the old-fashioned way.
0.0	0.509240279206	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.

0.0	0.437861962583	May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care?
1.0	0.445273295873	Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.

0.0	0.361716032191	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.532185741436	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.231784463623	How the hell can you vote for this guy?
0.0	0.342226932404	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.701656169764	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.691374073433	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.586003429193	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.619457085707	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.72813740281	And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.
0.0	0.245093780873	I'm the only person...
0.0	0.322703175021	And in fact I would go further.

0.0	0.29224618087	Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond...
0.0	0.233287022171	Kevin, if I could just jump in.
0.0	0.277492791283	I can do that.
0.0	0.260118030876	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.277818724738	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.342898491177	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.705240887511	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.220725125849	So, I thank you very much for that.
0.0	0.264001070416	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.577812104988	It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.
0.0	0.276207906211	Can you believe this?
0.0	0.273416080992	Let me give you the bad news.
0.0	0.444320065261	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.44223991197	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.315630010121	I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.
0.0	0.274874538967	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.656470030175	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.373387941757	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.692163585701	I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history.
0.0	0.597545960222	And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
0.0	0.646657798669	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.299892995973	But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college.
0.0	0.506778661182	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.
0.0	0.509103499673	I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.
0.0	0.209659834046	... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.
1.0	0.7089214746	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.691467350926	And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.425854699707	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.277870206422	So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating, but the highest median income in America.
0.0	0.284317054321	The Obama administration.
0.0	0.654738173025	Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country.
0.0	0.337752295968	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.
0.0	0.704630499335	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.296994354416	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.427927698138	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.265190532925	It is enormously complicated.
0.0	0.255722667299	That's what we need.
0.0	0.315352073994	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.245497960811	Yes, I'm getting...
0.0	0.615281867731	He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration.
0.0	0.625824097882	We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president.
0.0	0.339594266989	And when he moved on his own people, threatening a massacre, genocide, the Europeans and the Arabs, our allies and partners, did ask for American help and we provided it.
0.0	0.216124918802	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
0.0	0.574069287082	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.279985230932	I will be ready.
0.0	0.290979761114	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.301557500411	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.676969468665	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.
0.0	0.599705309528	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
1.0	0.312074001033	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.291737628138	That's right.
0.0	0.374990710265	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.313462158982	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.451926583671	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.360615302465	Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done.
0.0	0.275766305707	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.528941703519	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.265931582586	That's not right.
0.0	0.5	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.28306616378	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.292780708076	My background is different.
0.0	0.273545898132	He's wrong.
0.0	0.533549766296	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.266913710329	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.527656441916	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.438579435138	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.257145003169	Kathie, this was not merely theory in Maryland.
0.0	0.384786136644	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.32893549825	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.394672791836	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.630331515449	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
1.0	0.787534149731	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
0.0	0.705282438503	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.430352463683	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.583407581897	But at the end of the day, no doubt, the Affordable Care Act is a step forward.
0.0	0.339542931457	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.611952103399	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.301986588019	Washington is broken.
0.0	0.220454088856	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.378710463905	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.251614473606	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.475962011985	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.281505471842	They don't have a clue.
0.0	0.63021329921	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.401403788241	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.567450130709	And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.
0.0	0.270559024396	I agree with that.
0.0	0.210917785381	But you know what we did in Maryland?
0.0	0.586781047457	I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena.
0.0	0.27505882468	(inaudible).
0.0	0.352688705587	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.584648325053	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.27917453072	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.251460608042	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.397828145459	And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives.
0.0	0.262522562779	So you know what?
0.0	0.537134174852	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
0.0	0.401021836802	I released 34 years of tax returns...
0.0	0.683523747673	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
0.0	0.269325346679	Media notwithstanding.
0.0	0.206786063983	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.667844046648	So let's move toward what we should be doing as a nation and follow the values of our immigration history and begin to make it possible for them to come out of the shadows and to have a future that gives them a full chance of citizenship.
0.0	0.405348313541	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.396924467137	But unlike either of these two fine people, I've actually balanced a budget every single year.
0.0	0.404214684432	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.260821145006	I heard what they said.
