0.0	0.289580002742	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.

0.0	0.398996749009	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.39337784684	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.

0.0	0.37184473822	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.465595696949	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.

0.0	0.124259457536	Maria...
0.0	0.456933759755	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.476023353206	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.491441969015	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.318724080711	The Europeans have moved on.

0.0	0.374378654176	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.51518586967	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.447881289227	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.41681287653	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.319834610135	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.608283901376	It was.
0.0	0.417572846202	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.401885750083	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.413600034724	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.29750141791	We have to find out what's going on.

0.0	0.328608066631	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.294828166892	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.402476805598	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.5	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.393826668233	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.412563165258	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.434497049532	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.401830129075	She sees her cost of electricity going up.

0.0	0.448791516622	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.463058304245	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.403566297944	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.438693864244	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.111730834457	We are not France.
0.0	0.389608535554	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.431716004101	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.469136713872	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.417110811841	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.459576945744	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.440814350605	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.413164038817	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.457435709306	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.448518197994	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.448478808437	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.418672927832	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.321318042142	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.457420801063	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.510634710599	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.458152710438	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.358433533189	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.483154349476	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.380776665736	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.445940508474	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.35736337284	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.493754970673	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.447461482614	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.318137846495	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.280479018931	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.4309753578	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.259905580796	You're right.
0.0	0.444913513154	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.38653404166	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.37404990923	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.433023485915	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.485900534732	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.

0.0	0.273355244687	She was right.
0.0	0.380164302609	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.451730033475	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.453491028317	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.482783221305	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.480634879021	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.456236137724	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.379538939687	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.38845189573	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.308791365694	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.428078660656	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.299931164406	We don't win.
0.0	0.370549812526	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.273355244687	That's not right.
0.0	0.257622236912	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.4162031865	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.36309440658	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.521893852982	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.

0.0	0.432708308976	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.527938112771	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
1.0	0.868737204748	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.441602978433	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.

0.0	0.456752542475	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.465956380545	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.398534785388	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.312251084477	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.47739984705	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.236583910055	Not bad.
0.0	0.494268762665	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.

0.0	0.376673910713	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.539074986103	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.447897787663	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
1.0	0.775626370053	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.530080633416	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.431406070103	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.388660656433	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.457522253326	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.387953879174	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.370641422745	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.454538246276	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.432817710519	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.519757919788	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.35962901882	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.302721473637	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.432729197958	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.368979862933	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.463594469658	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.361345392309	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.349671577899	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.608283901376	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.344764959239	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.385998518447	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.205383405993	Okay.
0.0	0.505854889674	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.358377464431	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.26031290422	That's for sure.
0.0	0.516191232635	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.

0.0	0.431217498028	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.362541458114	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.484756134113	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.270362072766	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.457011535686	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.435547015615	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.

0.0	0.454082103097	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.363039564091	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.413982002359	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.447444904457	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.386844947072	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.150021091154	Divide that out.
0.0	0.285619992167	I said no.
0.0	0.482361297481	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.455865331607	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.384599122369	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
1.0	0.788548511015	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.353806807767	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.443125467321	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.34771994004	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.464472914855	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
1.0	0.462989467155	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.417998840146	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.363703198638	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.471698026586	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.376794392205	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.37589885938	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.456628152474	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.378453373688	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.440445920294	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.442551318139	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.476923777053	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.327928132209	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.269373618693	I like that.
0.0	0.405664760318	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.162442820237	We can't do it.
0.0	0.472335901139	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.365755963679	And so do I.
0.0	0.290763867702	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.237109834725	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.363332985068	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.5	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.473138057406	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.416617054962	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.394592990347	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.349605968777	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.429448113721	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.440294770602	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.462899440759	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.320745382287	Can we stop?
0.0	0.447595649973	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.43593222832	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.368539930725	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.408257831952	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.434250411271	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.343445327153	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.337770002235	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.414902687515	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.383828518478	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.255387246581	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.392974255652	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.413867443058	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.277206676404	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.426454048257	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.365623990998	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.352957410103	He has never defended...
0.0	0.471398721903	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.457097972466	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.459002682984	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.344985546904	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.41206143288	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.399401483931	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.250682605109	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.387696625878	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.311870909692	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.453989935694	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.400462396391	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.403495108705	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.440212955803	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
1.0	0.765852381896	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.489650153982	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.453014203793	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.311415315076	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.409661269128	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.427201226212	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.486184819837	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.435610622817	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.407532596397	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.480799930842	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.398110060565	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.352981724894	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.235421186505	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.369567166344	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.447068483336	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.455738275931	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.378737869138	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.608283901376	But...
0.0	0.38814886452	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.516249541957	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.356354916051	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.467071871216	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.329812469009	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.370404360023	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.458593318574	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.432018837326	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.37898201456	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.447908841907	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.423916805504	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.448565106067	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.425857425646	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.422626432848	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.409637404274	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.480841664639	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.4561403793	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.453890103405	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.423678646808	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.436711666071	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.304503661893	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.394261973564	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.48949563975	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.43729762623	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.34416560884	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.5	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.374391041609	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.458088052493	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.148654756113	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.493461341346	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.443609524295	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.343487641592	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.320703039715	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.430438007343	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.40716773577	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.378360568031	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.292201908955	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.467944826188	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.5	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.453716141628	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.353921396107	We need security.
0.0	0.473620399424	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.481328440717	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.425677102042	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.490079547823	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.390388471338	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.47496425251	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.409619024114	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.306994014024	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.475824385669	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.466730400913	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.421100189568	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.331234560259	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.377400923897	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.489021063106	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.486955940566	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.425823379104	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.451837736663	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.256180929056	We're friends.
0.0	0.36220837842	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.440881732674	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
1.0	0.521058497347	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.257622236912	And you know what?
0.0	0.608283901376	No.
1.0	0.770049049972	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.444849674478	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.455739752503	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.442453539057	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.461450426526	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.426292387447	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.5	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.483279940175	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.422947290206	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.429811057625	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.346220236485	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.364176843814	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.322507804434	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.33878656307	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.312001045056	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.41009111769	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
1.0	0.746019993145	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.455220125224	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.417176027117	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.387530510307	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.410632321762	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.378396419582	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.353953397828	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.481143726153	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.356928305265	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.430454673466	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.42620875829	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.384891695337	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.279103203627	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.409555875594	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.2011372554	OK.
0.0	0.379762150716	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.608283901376	That has not been...
0.0	0.289841105547	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.399551692845	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.389264660518	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.389964763773	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.352314847966	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.457396528007	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.347922688287	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.396235378648	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.42094116985	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.412813071119	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.296678563481	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.361005231029	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.360591077088	We know this for a fact.
1.0	0.800560031411	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.5	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.434848209235	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.111112451533	...Chris...
0.0	0.225610686043	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.491498430344	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.489365956519	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.384404502527	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.53002441262	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.414970954372	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.289294163639	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.477263849283	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.382950623675	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.390195063508	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.320083441845	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.388962721296	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.37723858019	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.469797922376	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.277697685321	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.431857958005	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.262064423599	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.361297124478	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.456457749882	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.400289965043	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.48285459663	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.47051339007	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.442883039978	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.5	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.466035035998	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.454585255288	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.456410511629	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.494283357106	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.493183074691	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.459173876115	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.259265420399	You really can't.
0.0	0.5	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.5	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.367516163855	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.207029284316	We have no borders.
0.0	0.449188971872	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.437583757932	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.34722501278	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.362542363426	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.486948726099	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.192534044278	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.438837578657	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.339514537148	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.448801791309	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.466167653535	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.396882198641	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.407910144302	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.465831349544	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.394575431109	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.458083458899	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.400790246193	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.486568929384	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.45310867261	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.461648552261	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.420871204631	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.432222427669	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.402340566353	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.24874349981	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.488082210962	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.294636900122	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.5	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.431405932541	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.362588095303	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.444190059218	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.464609302812	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.345388474337	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.445106150601	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.5	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.42927856658	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.343357603828	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.237357447959	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.285878118771	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.40292877482	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.321571978534	Well, sure.
0.0	0.492364091952	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.39634972665	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.251759222791	I can do that.
0.0	0.445854063407	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.334545568437	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.374694626534	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.378091606186	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.305168631804	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.382173044948	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.463474024587	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.472272245178	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.272808857116	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.390563747769	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.453826076736	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.486559919594	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.34024869764	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.454283857449	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.490598308677	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.368209478311	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.608283901376	No -- no...
0.0	0.283308899035	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.249001584331	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.477843112616	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.0823424494783	Thank you.
0.0	0.35486444086	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.452271458935	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.45958383466	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.423183950443	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.163071198716	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.478325122649	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.304877892833	She said the truth.
0.0	0.386164688302	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.5	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.45334645601	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.39332367145	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.369869959524	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.231649955835	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.421194998792	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.474322339118	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.440419461322	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.428329861764	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
1.0	0.517045545142	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.331979089864	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.507131288907	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
1.0	0.466955263601	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.399594666228	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.486650621512	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.234580502552	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.371483046443	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.44715733943	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.369761406692	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.471600487261	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.435989739426	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.3850368491	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.327883828629	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.466749867711	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.525771716423	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.299771613822	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.389068659909	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.36618769427	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.33464105769	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.524568708471	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.420074208093	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.28845576209	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.29564041497	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.483182760595	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
1.0	0.8472750351	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.241320295502	That's not true.
0.0	0.167016746116	Yeah.
0.0	0.429747524433	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.411342967122	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?

0.0	0.366197196366	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.464298563232	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.

1.0	0.768768279003	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.442390936211	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.480963608318	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.0823424494783	Thank you.
0.0	0.349060250508	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.

0.0	0.472286804064	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.428923256565	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.

0.0	0.474989754432	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.414203348941	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.437867477468	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.437747360761	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.466081082095	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.469641369343	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.5	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.392208861312	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.167016746116	Yeah.
0.0	0.428618730664	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.366553681105	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.439996767777	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.460659020953	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.397491585905	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.397498093001	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.428291849887	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.251397886189	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.428469620772	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.391455827535	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
1.0	0.452824814652	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.524009710964	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
1.0	0.7784784364	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.401591385527	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.251759222791	You can have him.
0.0	0.394085889738	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.397364876127	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.5	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.406032175925	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.460683236108	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.418251810383	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.394502161685	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.454254906015	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.443247184399	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.462737072013	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.421400140112	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.447204401561	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.448538151779	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.314029730065	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.509277142652	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.374038852513	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.385800989726	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.410717021144	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.515581343695	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.451447724367	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.401830129075	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.2011372554	OK?
0.0	0.355876907272	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.322507804434	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.39855807077	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.378016205856	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.460551908243	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.285088287702	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.347851026546	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.457419208196	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.471312986209	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.474598733231	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.378991088927	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.468954059947	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.354569776085	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.379393912156	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.441477345117	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.400054318095	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.458097753374	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.256564694779	Illegal.
0.0	0.381258614758	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.33800533611	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.397338147461	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.426913046506	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.

0.0	0.308359499673	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.0823424494783	Thank you.
0.0	0.380022064672	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.360485243809	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.277125784061	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.36774724126	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.423569327383	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.374528029026	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
1.0	0.797033119361	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.39007728979	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.441018989219	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.425899012412	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.449718227709	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.492020294528	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.514488413682	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.446388105439	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.46548487121	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.39851742231	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.389608535554	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.443709540057	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.15473732072	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.452760096064	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.448899354105	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.418959980245	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.484382100643	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.456934121716	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.419900450641	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.417963079751	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.374278238651	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.393068915482	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.391828465395	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.

0.0	0.211195439741	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.429507166393	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.389020664397	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.41570465878	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.

0.0	0.458493206989	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.608283901376	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.437669694961	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.475902558176	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.

0.0	0.401596179743	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.491077391548	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.470965460606	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
1.0	0.855301568376	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.245386485487	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.344083472336	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.309218090305	I've laid out...
0.0	0.257622236912	You know why?
0.0	0.5	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.436290930976	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.423149205817	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.419087153149	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.465800121987	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.222249740015	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.484153778709	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.34750952077	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.446463603805	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.269584824233	They don't like that.
0.0	0.388651574616	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.38857320754	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.487860515682	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.362547275742	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.420621404105	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.488908131668	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.608283901376	No.
0.0	0.416293146061	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.481143638527	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.431061132524	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.424194395576	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.432987044485	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.438338819581	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.416521078086	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.45380751312	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.304187848983	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.608283901376	We do.
0.0	0.373703082704	I never said that.
0.0	0.131406567745	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.361749389147	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.376654257465	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.434139012878	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.264360941709	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.372247510637	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.135640542243	John.
0.0	0.347274558848	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.479860310002	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.446729022577	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.403695726823	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.413779373432	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.434374700678	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.424202948161	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.382412718142	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.434653723406	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.405923525962	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.451717375662	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.438136793534	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.46877035225	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.415492487921	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.450505797407	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.444126092914	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.448462192022	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.435899162141	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.356650862047	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.4307926585	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.493052345614	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.311450929246	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.348193507887	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.433399596191	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.422700912132	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.2011372554	OK.
0.0	0.44406877346	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.478541858835	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.319318320415	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.330387933203	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.370259726067	I'm never going to change my tune.
1.0	0.524265855177	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.31846112602	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.391716398778	I would just say that...
0.0	0.268818476155	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.222353763172	That's my view.
0.0	0.421985245679	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.33829639242	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.248000992263	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.185513106246	But look...
0.0	0.489722366302	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.530373881499	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.447127075549	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.432015820256	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.508626683487	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.409139235695	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.5	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.435862001365	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.456661981944	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.458712530764	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.348509992029	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.253125836608	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.200965069496	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.377336623089	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.293215035281	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.45003567135	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.395879171122	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.426431290567	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.34237736505	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.226650911772	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.43453651304	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.311251465321	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.405460764394	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.382375906679	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.352243104528	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.405980459537	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.331615353032	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.448258973465	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.404474966292	I know every one.
0.0	0.149743951265	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.125230989423	...No, sir...
0.0	0.5	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.335383393596	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.160088913484	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.453567460178	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.133744084179	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.409142222377	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.0982579307684	And we are not England.
0.0	0.47187177343	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.331499831394	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.318089075688	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.488994647505	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
1.0	0.830927298434	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.420451908782	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.327866048575	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.492135081732	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.5	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.411462639715	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.465807370436	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.417910584225	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.4553784683	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.422800172059	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.404497968589	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
1.0	0.788098700673	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.361122103647	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.411458409044	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.362070568195	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.488204075194	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.447356176207	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.488026380404	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.300814499788	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.30775700284	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.39961496248	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.

0.0	0.389499037353	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.37895809259	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.608283901376	No.
0.0	0.45002111966	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.445742072407	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.412626206124	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.440086843566	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.48104916455	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.313891575063	And for good cause.
0.0	0.429256460332	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.

0.0	0.328240259306	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.400560733565	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.

0.0	0.414439013924	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.404174246233	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.505370209425	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.368000868473	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.475688495121	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.468523751211	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.35628304847	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.276461381352	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.258051161511	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.389778127701	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
1.0	0.85900010091	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.440455300104	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.376802716181	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.183523102317	HEMMER: Wow.

0.0	0.318708668726	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.47234463964	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.417477092116	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.425833408903	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.4558732553	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.377389139404	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.451279789836	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.379056665654	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.322198322836	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.443077176122	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.329895039284	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.367212332373	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.423592140285	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.398738513134	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.44905103391	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.32295239126	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.421798801591	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.472326287105	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
1.0	0.764844541993	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.336053509857	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.467390515721	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.472184899202	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.428654268041	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.204305180275	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.258069223437	I'm a fighter.
1.0	0.782306665358	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.143677296271	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.259905580796	You're right.
0.0	0.465650492438	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.403707370685	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.444965048535	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.455673218698	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.235636672574	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.347638041483	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.487408866022	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.388114151016	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.38853164988	You know why three?
0.0	0.211294170007	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.427487777471	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.380892875248	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.470045605751	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.360026633351	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.37392779115	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.424038457185	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.426235688297	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.403009846098	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.47371157091	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.213733233019	I promise.
0.0	0.398720017291	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.39206126214	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.48955480837	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.376508557568	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.470220739495	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.471605345303	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.355471474605	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.5	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.377695618627	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.462282821279	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.427616524243	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.456403923839	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.333851868842	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.47825867093	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.467815333684	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.363202263475	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.35660262317	What have you got now?
0.0	0.468542734694	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.444513229428	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.438416807989	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.238770919548	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.424415566508	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.40796064643	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.378005059629	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.266012636946	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.470117577609	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.461697256704	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.362080271869	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.425639614363	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.608283901376	I have...
0.0	0.399695785426	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.447155621181	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.431356133723	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.427031759949	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.428934286968	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.410534765597	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.472005705759	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.378016601621	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.3376683493	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.270848413376	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.403685489647	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.461618450303	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.445613155697	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.608283901376	No.
0.0	0.295743665247	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.41813484488	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.286278411015	You get together.
0.0	0.301027850499	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.460013716264	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.447703519127	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.480416017464	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.19553958614	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.44111230482	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.393476099879	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.478568025313	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.321074774899	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.43508620429	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.423447604896	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.361813737594	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.419951744756	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.135640542243	John?
0.0	0.318707533365	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.356959320914	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.349577792998	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.373359253881	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.378829423426	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.453306713853	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.49112698695	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.515173046842	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
1.0	0.330625705853	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.467774010725	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.386943262603	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.5	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.416751680247	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.349946005346	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.505119967184	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.458913892933	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.143104850682	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.2567996694	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.471976173434	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.458406120517	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.40651662657	The number of women --
0.0	0.405279449834	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.

0.0	0.355806650531	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.484445096705	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.477104653782	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.262356425792	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.392148033748	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.449399997915	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.205572502415	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.447833952349	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.5	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.608283901376	I was not at all.
0.0	0.348349074429	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.431622464488	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.418469020551	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.248269385959	We can't do this unilaterally.
1.0	0.431081312736	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.334578631359	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.

0.0	0.449422513132	Secretary of state for four years.

0.0	0.519361958643	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.435428037416	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.353049040849	It was Countrywide Mortgage.

0.0	0.342669121152	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.442185762608	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.362212413664	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.376684662167	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.171282897516	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.5	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.412202672855	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.442720771081	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.428838784284	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.397913473342	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.44999764743	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
1.0	0.491424599174	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.

0.0	0.377787045084	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.361048781611	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.488464606914	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.463658573919	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.358175062887	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.202811577496	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.465524103682	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.440141679404	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.438036837051	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.463570032481	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.401591274395	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.449969350898	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.608283901376	Why?
0.0	0.487823316728	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
1.0	0.795443060209	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.399106942918	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.439359279511	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.111112451533	...Chris...
0.0	0.449855357357	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.455476017931	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.453143877271	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.489275014474	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.230430692074	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.278987699163	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.349659556654	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.335776582767	Our next president...
0.0	0.447627613871	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.416263019517	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.298500063406	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.428350895271	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.375464281158	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.304691790875	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.464740224223	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.511191682962	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.48735853613	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.435518508737	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.463908841612	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.5	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.334418894673	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.360492585749	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.486777640832	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.417008510562	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.38887001488	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.5	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.470700969007	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.470031149024	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.373654769212	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.302828950428	Ever.
0.0	0.424158906618	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.434724715003	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.225985734008	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.320678367835	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.354888467387	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.475338396911	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.37724178643	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.508018475904	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.437131953557	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.455038527406	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.345341178114	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.5	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.458585475493	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
1.0	0.769793819389	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.293314926378	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.44843335979	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.4462453764	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.31707004322	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.442290556695	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.355361216683	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.408942488372	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.470505305543	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.460428541233	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.177014288567	Neil...
0.0	0.487949073021	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.37899251658	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.529033912184	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.354605146172	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.365132819064	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.44371179189	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.330696279899	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.384910400307	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.368065919223	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.398445815928	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.476039287046	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.322808653603	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.42854160719	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.2538871995	In addition to that...
0.0	0.344053474371	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.510693608374	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.408857092025	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.432456709772	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.415144323142	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.157626131195	I was the architect.
0.0	0.0823424494783	Thank you.
0.0	0.443301965016	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.489164376212	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.444319430083	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
1.0	0.420985867256	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.472460175327	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.448258973465	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.48793401463	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.473158958592	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.471892508563	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.439594786059	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.391994603711	Just for the record.
0.0	0.380222933949	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.47487199954	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.410197724086	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.451448550667	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.401141337261	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.367289151463	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.446612029537	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.400544372376	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.40827794111	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.465577076116	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.356551821302	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.480076880815	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.398688919281	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.257622236912	You know that.
0.0	0.447018570287	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.436178857905	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.44957336155	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
1.0	0.808765099049	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.45388351487	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.414740583604	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.457140457093	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.471592880414	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.507211329294	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.429012845818	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.390840664846	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.456198179957	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.445260096758	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.415223021177	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.399339076613	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.490948029592	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.442678488461	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.409463618821	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.257198367277	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.194634108192	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.510821538834	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.357867867995	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.452660052754	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.456281996218	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.357467001351	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.482546938959	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.348432552281	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.391026083131	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.483654723454	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.44228640534	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.459195677075	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.373703082704	I never said that.
0.0	0.425046116561	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.445727275327	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.494750929291	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.338829035174	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.415130084642	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.396089759486	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.5	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.469244016079	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.292280446269	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.464134523634	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.257622236912	And you know what?
0.0	0.248000992263	That's what we need.
0.0	0.459272057138	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.400886724128	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.382916828401	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.479310090266	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.413398190821	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.469643918703	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.439010011071	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.381718966645	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.399293550947	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.427465922571	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.431598013223	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.199058593781	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.284758878256	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.436046751345	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.347375984737	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.406982656105	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.47945541677	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.437628293651	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
1.0	0.519045053145	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.389653303334	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.361050165652	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.374501191392	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.359008837637	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.401930294109	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.474289905735	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.450098858445	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.335976042646	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.398677232623	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.381492887564	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.340622220211	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.311218714048	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.405788013115	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.363061826985	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.396455623126	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.475121576774	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.4238326246	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.344985546904	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.373556886824	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.339987714265	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.444318424578	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.332017280814	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.421260113739	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.475688495121	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.464631475668	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.445397502701	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.471494678743	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.38171912363	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.48323319162	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.416873478821	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.398480270723	Let me give you one quick example.
1.0	0.79641152837	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.412676422409	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.375461508833	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.0823424494783	Thank you.
0.0	0.392275992672	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.339902728477	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.333339109847	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.469556131869	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.463534416174	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.608283901376	Why is that?
0.0	0.51954254659	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.367562167683	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.435819881066	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.284581836512	I totally get that.
0.0	0.472378742518	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.388887674088	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.489322065554	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.420801818461	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.303866209883	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.513287006887	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.139128289304	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.3929684331	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.462703387393	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.486077247695	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.608283901376	And why?
0.0	0.341110724076	... tariffs that come against us.
1.0	0.530373881499	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.410565424425	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.426205037424	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.422455897501	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.32960550416	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.197330293977	Absolutely.
0.0	0.39598783211	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.376358683377	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.456192295173	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.452140324834	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.29148874419	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.437594334206	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.374801258253	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
1.0	0.767940294155	They were wrong.
0.0	0.449116053122	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.467887493849	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.5	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.366862165856	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.608283901376	How about this?
0.0	0.361636905512	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.489253854451	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.435603721708	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.32037684394	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.379587038786	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.475887668011	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.409735798351	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.5	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.5	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.454032520784	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.391539143783	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.290551585618	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.52222110842	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.383104283164	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.359866926376	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.400618511731	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.427716826948	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.411193651476	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.197330293977	Absolutely.
0.0	0.608283901376	I have.
0.0	0.377326797399	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.139128289304	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.434127158705	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.382752934929	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.45841368218	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.254916069385	Yes.
0.0	0.418308625207	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.379614499074	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.440492231651	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.356892356635	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.473904187149	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.380246337717	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.425945446128	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.331697438611	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
1.0	0.828721973449	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.365881043775	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.414278399398	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.35772511924	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.451929207079	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.234332493058	They were wrong.
0.0	0.408595777391	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.406016896806	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.465168043405	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.470858310154	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.382440082844	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.431791532847	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.489328574417	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.318555317301	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.441427142184	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
1.0	0.184148598697	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.244028791387	...before I go.
0.0	0.370907703809	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.442197299144	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.608283901376	That's what he is.
0.0	0.452527898444	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.344153468515	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.42060366172	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.471651621617	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.390989778054	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.297833162934	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.450685341202	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.441999352048	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.441214443472	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.318129466161	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.424280429826	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.465419193074	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.391501116944	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.374065278405	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.464832490625	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.463146674714	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.519740275778	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.362359242411	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.473432204672	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.331971340881	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.418845071553	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.305984454334	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.424151577403	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.135640542243	No, John.
0.0	0.361033601064	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.37208545331	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.452951997889	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
1.0	0.440537597811	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.454552651258	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.29432496663	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.489293015979	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.276810621238	But, we can't rest.

0.0	0.384613798511	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.444334305331	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.5	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.418711791465	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.39113364334	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.257622236912	And you know what?
0.0	0.431139861024	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.493275166355	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.421424677489	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.300517115218	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.473869147615	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.391703765064	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.482898341963	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.380879647696	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
1.0	0.466436017011	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.485913863223	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.266323671806	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.350752730962	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.5	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.371885250901	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.394835141374	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.40264083542	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.304367150387	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.296118436456	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.266685150708	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.456456442174	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.441413196204	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.460946113284	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.46369981693	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.5	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.436551487871	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.520348467447	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.442800320551	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.32072023112	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.428510101137	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.372004428742	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.371488752759	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.332810503754	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.302113987561	I think he is right.
1.0	0.830009595755	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.400201002355	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.379735000177	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.347201219459	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.16874866799	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.522153894467	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.490346766194	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.524605868452	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.480385331841	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.512996577747	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.428504158127	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.336582801555	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.260029261075	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.307913308954	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.421832710518	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.387950348651	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.5	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.226634682604	Both served.
0.0	0.455834287751	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.22015577574	I will not do that.
0.0	0.375074150329	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.426407735817	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.471956594058	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.394698238921	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.48872846868	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
1.0	0.395394403095	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.273355244687	Right.
0.0	0.17274418843	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.359866973857	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.248861776341	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.448210394869	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.218572975054	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.417763626069	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.275525395317	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.403074592297	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.475332547657	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.424239672258	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.608283901376	It is.
0.0	0.436237843507	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.306149654045	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.36671014641	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.31901203015	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.46154582338	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.389608535554	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.480676180777	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.462703387393	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.401721580439	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.453451859747	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.235065402643	You find me...
0.0	0.428778687171	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.205222877815	I have no idea.
0.0	0.470998000893	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.381702351466	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.479406025883	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.394227561051	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.379104719834	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.433293032722	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.334818680417	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.440278309981	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.318360172702	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.331979089864	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.488355592223	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.250967110054	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.400618327968	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.469514249222	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.468767158602	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.457001452877	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.287637100337	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.478390566435	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.237109834725	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.522926474311	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.422043029327	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.426986496621	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.395847929233	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.441604038566	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.442919498582	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.373923300952	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.451984727917	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.5	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.408535566077	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
1.0	0.762013970326	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.372366123498	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.304721518044	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.478769436777	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.407289366902	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.462525873751	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.213352300778	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.4479810611	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.360874251619	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.445866444638	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.299052261045	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.388992901851	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.412568424544	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.47382832217	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.456023673413	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.410105371582	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.518881801843	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.329783162902	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.308574280249	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.412442343766	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.257622236912	They know.
0.0	0.385780880997	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.431378130978	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.46030512942	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.485951137804	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.444463595819	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.350081334244	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.478494955253	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.373792211096	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.417055017412	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.470821656741	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.32739700262	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.431611898586	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.430652523044	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.235773961253	That's my bill.
1.0	0.374140673506	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.0766286276787	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.402268888997	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.381142145906	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.406658924595	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.48531621693	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.467502234911	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.331173767483	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.456707295111	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.46776179015	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.405186493325	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.459994306352	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.385390219922	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.419141095324	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.480581782113	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.

0.0	0.39395977136	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.608283901376	...
0.0	0.366300444044	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.442817220786	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.405576879132	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.366841700258	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.412758819826	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.405763730958	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.475231277095	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.462946036433	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.429820833495	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.

0.0	0.491564725666	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.405001588507	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.431090508072	But we allowed people to keep health care.

0.0	0.17110219378	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.428588072651	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.428521466164	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.368109930373	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.409098374265	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.

0.0	0.5	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.294846399963	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.428343330559	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.

0.0	0.5	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.482893084458	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.396452517093	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.454907768424	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.452437460623	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.529724123692	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.5	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.415568402458	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.459740457446	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.47078405897	So many companies are going to leave our country.

0.0	0.386865115011	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.470396953756	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.5	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.

0.0	0.39458475587	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.514071164639	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?

0.0	0.400670730951	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.

0.0	0.482485554999	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.313290074003	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.312022340648	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.437844279048	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...

0.0	0.447195173011	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
1.0	0.282146879871	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.386841233582	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.365254986525	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.44406877346	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.5	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.478992322536	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.451791277765	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.3712761616	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.439721939918	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.448992623998	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.434754562441	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.42230685324	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.486584581499	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.0823424494783	Thank you.
0.0	0.162442820237	I can't do it.
0.0	0.509224075007	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
1.0	0.290216203334	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.364855599945	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.35673108345	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.435741823148	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.215330524554	That's fine.
0.0	0.448291846043	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.272184083922	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.408143541956	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.450143255936	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.414375428151	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.375209132824	We actually did it.
0.0	0.268138498471	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.360396600869	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.461678811136	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.608283901376	You do.
0.0	0.505548382615	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.341317685468	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.456138294635	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.276081005038	We don't need that.
0.0	0.416565949988	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.273355244687	That's not right.
0.0	0.309207581614	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.169665569619	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.367999081571	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.477490006202	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.409974867804	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.5	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.306920356097	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.445765464862	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.399097100898	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.379350750991	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.262681869178	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.41634328642	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.351123883605	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.5	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.513707493202	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.413852430647	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.413444878607	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.41390230425	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.425714107067	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.332188904737	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.260028094249	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.432837845803	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.392491362964	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.422403017788	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.451925880024	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.287437588001	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.373703082704	I never said that.
1.0	0.425506767186	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.348119265055	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.471089537307	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.382790517786	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.44865456885	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.452555828724	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.466034608457	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.269373618693	I like it.
0.0	0.405410018478	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.359333997136	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.345142543734	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.379655835885	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.451155248859	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.351579441207	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.349064993514	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.407474403329	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.226115237291	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.468467499189	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.413977348641	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.267246178441	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.388427015011	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.511723197847	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.223799919332	I changed that.
0.0	0.478321801203	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.456124499554	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.471650292898	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.403799787794	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.269584824233	I don't like that.
0.0	0.482765572754	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.348901878858	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.40556101313	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.399828076313	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.40145005641	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.304691909466	I've done it.
0.0	0.403763167447	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.481992562932	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.319429126464	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.393681570685	Our country doesn't win anymore.
1.0	0.479770008273	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.462217065681	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.411368456892	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.491701381397	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.467828207055	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.471690963267	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.47448842495	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.197330293977	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.344960095997	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.0823424494783	Thank you.
0.0	0.464107183352	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.418135959881	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.343242333294	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.446711882994	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.434885266926	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.421562837383	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.349077309524	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.373199233312	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.2011372554	OK?
0.0	0.378550376387	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.35138737661	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.354772715359	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.320980161048	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.288811477827	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.411915749497	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.36416307697	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.355113676039	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.314762267412	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.445915050909	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.490666332006	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.39566687636	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.372025158421	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.43115821928	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.471914841245	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
1.0	0.859612552209	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.486708363507	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.317555511633	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.467441739874	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.39661242698	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.454374458915	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
1.0	0.830990410318	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.437201781798	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.381918043734	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.436189527747	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.340052899422	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.289508571892	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.40930564372	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.472095107451	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.32745421333	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.388060242659	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.362921709789	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.391308871938	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.257622236912	So you know what?
0.0	0.397597575096	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.329448458603	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.257622236912	And you know what?
0.0	0.170783235029	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.472327571492	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.

0.0	0.427997390696	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.36211539926	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.459254165045	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.399772081255	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.467153880194	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.284722001596	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.418358175687	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.

0.0	0.327526639777	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.355740528081	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.456108090394	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.465872059834	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.

0.0	0.429053714873	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.43394913607	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.368830161245	We need to rebuild our families.

0.0	0.462430177756	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.468086487507	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.

0.0	0.35840298815	The planes are older than the pilots.

0.0	0.439513042344	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.412990399691	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.377791473574	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.5	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.435507109166	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.362464213944	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.323478485275	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.358026481907	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.285619992167	That's what I said.
1.0	0.467648226069	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.296394915475	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.46507000044	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.251759222791	I can.
0.0	0.465880618497	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.430681653856	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.134157608655	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.406944874224	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.162290399084	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.415492487921	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.40820258997	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.374056699411	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.44497883177	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.257622236912	But you know what?
0.0	0.5	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.465095452485	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.437957487417	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.5	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.40101111485	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.407682528843	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.413958640112	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.355559538373	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.459730456635	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.31559496668	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.41108560345	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.462218195335	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.151007333436	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.45479241922	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.489127274225	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.477869693851	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.478252893771	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.438391711427	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.454182436585	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.608283901376	No.
0.0	0.363225191372	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.421874100584	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.328471650699	Let me say on that...
1.0	0.754713168577	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.364418337549	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.467876652426	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.437820805852	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.478821497375	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.23190939306	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.464131719994	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.473523471775	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.424973891425	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.5	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.28935830213	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.403709811173	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.482686555236	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.489275674938	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.408188873993	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.484753460709	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.392532362642	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.443021905657	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.45667565835	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.608283901376	...
0.0	0.315627927994	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.459987169332	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.41865796977	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.426940513186	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.510955871262	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.5	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.371671720982	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.429882330147	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.426263959906	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.395070080347	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.47721331372	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.376156501307	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.390109955951	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.5	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.423847158108	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.458480846351	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.323006791597	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.484015160357	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.382719669281	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.247514585741	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.491192928913	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.458779291329	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.476859549201	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
1.0	0.482531805769	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.404132081094	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.439682232003	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
1.0	0.787288477432	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.511394290554	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.456236137724	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
1.0	0.767940294155	That's wrong.
0.0	0.421934612961	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.446310065428	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.237938836369	But I would add this.
0.0	0.471342448396	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.608283901376	...
0.0	0.382521877409	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.304815955829	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.460673483201	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.278255246153	I'm tested.
1.0	0.492684496247	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.487063661096	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.437801959482	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.400442280876	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.398720903943	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.293601906091	My point is this.
0.0	0.456696803861	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.365103128936	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.255941403795	Thank you, senator.
1.0	0.819226582117	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.226092368182	I think you're --
0.0	0.482561011847	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.458645669409	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.5	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.2011372554	OK?
0.0	0.419047679533	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.372847786531	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.387088289366	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.

0.0	0.259139863867	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.429154543456	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.459242638872	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.

0.0	0.33820221956	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.481992562932	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.365503870682	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.38853164988	You know why three?

0.0	0.427825803511	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.282600348911	Well, I respectfully disagree.

0.0	0.426116965303	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.402913007918	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.408010294317	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.

1.0	0.83093594969	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.404029645596	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.443955346435	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.378411488522	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.458722972441	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.339759617448	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.478731398704	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.

0.0	0.427243406384	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.327928132209	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.359498640188	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.162659548798	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.419952587891	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.513881045361	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.452524028355	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.169088840224	It's a joke.

0.0	0.397871825343	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.400314993899	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.343474617967	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.257622236912	And you know what?
0.0	0.448462099612	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.433758937322	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.289294163639	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.410736116703	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.272106989153	You're simply not.
0.0	0.485721032454	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.420940217086	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.461281733903	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.422339534891	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.191057208125	I agree with them.
0.0	0.472913987168	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.430436474856	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.431086217659	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.285619992167	And, we said no.
0.0	0.394258631068	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.5	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.350633433672	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.393139350646	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.608283901376	And here's why.
0.0	0.34876528882	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.407286101583	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.382040104193	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.125592374205	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.41391935001	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.175908536093	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.524372699287	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.379419840375	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.398148491725	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.353506397698	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.487412144954	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.387246503644	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.460876151711	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.475631079955	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.462998849633	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.313112662213	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.439715008421	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.332067525127	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.487031398516	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.197163761277	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.431853111555	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.508846364366	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.475506745294	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.382770080598	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.357344746606	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.317322376719	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.419072135142	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.352049134921	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.461459111255	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.15473732072	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.382121193182	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.608283901376	You did.
0.0	0.39332367145	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.467992567585	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.419952587891	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.448411731532	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.40198154313	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.456734376113	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.394698238921	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.330452413799	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.456357272493	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.459244043597	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.22956664945	I would change them.
0.0	0.42564622126	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.475043007915	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.403129681234	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.448210411921	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.434532919364	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.

0.0	0.239548121199	See?
0.0	0.384482110417	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.483567189085	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
1.0	0.786328014507	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.411921800658	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.467077963111	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.425944732604	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.349415104171	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.472197146902	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.358142595469	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.434379697095	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.257379819352	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.411598601589	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.301782562293	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.370907703809	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.5	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.410982403696	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.288644577627	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.426036731485	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.252406128427	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.464126277444	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.534428247125	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.432812219393	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.375547305045	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.41675120843	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.449663202706	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.333906802	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.341992091705	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.317286748958	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.15897755075	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.461581650573	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.378416625349	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.430987067838	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.377715490888	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.445187189434	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.37803083699	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.301081895495	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.483238590793	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.425042175582	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.439880144996	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.41393747793	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.369020240073	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.485952010502	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.469471742283	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.472671554058	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.

0.0	0.411590929727	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.431675221474	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.444685085255	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.400794452203	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
1.0	0.440132695563	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.608283901376	No, you did.
0.0	0.408916894766	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.273355244687	Right.
0.0	0.275940471332	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.395245051351	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.405809807718	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.474533314087	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.414189081629	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.454114235304	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.484485706747	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.387662319899	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.41409894064	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.288954528432	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.39780977312	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.387107752311	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.197163761277	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.459014623889	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
1.0	0.79719744545	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.437056234337	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.437347941713	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.466774710053	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.464784486942	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.481044593019	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.368216947704	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.386429053988	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.368137332469	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.357411562794	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.431427562692	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.49363708087	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.

0.0	0.359667076442	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.436579948695	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.5	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.485657209066	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.442067059625	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.385252521702	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.369009660515	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.295961137666	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.374370977409	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.245433292895	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.145099556683	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.428139606016	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.34852954623	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.532563477528	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.441405491175	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.429523687067	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.223992527027	(inaudible).
0.0	0.431921847631	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.302113987561	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.418605327079	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.332247859902	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.442478421018	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.492040575737	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.507513848871	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.51898920931	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.450831890182	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.44449468608	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.391894590859	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.409772742353	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.39956676963	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.425056739775	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
1.0	0.363701288641	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.335668705016	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.416050281458	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.437577350914	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.313222858011	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.365837143356	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.42525423981	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.443175666048	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.479954070127	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.406766909439	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.360905864457	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.462902303371	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.426529616733	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.398969679857	You are working at McDonald's?
1.0	0.473120793274	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.221915568019	That's the difference.
0.0	0.396172681945	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.355954541914	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.457167504547	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.161042646642	But I was born here.
0.0	0.35923787839	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.436696152706	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.363828137502	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.451250515139	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.39227614758	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.343985524926	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.415711831194	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.487529882636	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.47550323719	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.348012565194	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.329922294688	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.406194187515	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.443761255315	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
1.0	0.7691914524	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.441613541355	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.439191907083	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.319031067065	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.428210176218	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.532046043866	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.470057278897	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.375917894266	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.434163384638	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.453267131111	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.464273448015	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.431451035622	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.21525421951	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.314271493491	It goes away.
0.0	0.188739919176	Wait for what?
0.0	0.233242149802	And guess what?
0.0	0.265113178139	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.29079652053	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.360395645585	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.0823424494783	Thank you.
0.0	0.33062499666	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.507143856905	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.432419541648	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.331262504211	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.489301751959	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.527951218517	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.420894141218	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.510507350023	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.406775381839	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.343600711522	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.488573898963	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.426202818437	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.482422977885	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.466619006087	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.487078596965	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.188087053352	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.473003351579	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.330653475921	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.494165526135	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.385045738954	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.401423665954	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.397025676201	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.40022680236	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.507952613554	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.390646644737	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.391581290311	We need to reform Social Security.
1.0	0.733610436253	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.358683699413	I'll give you a fact.
1.0	0.924166481769	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.317177451264	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.493326027498	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.441797401828	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.259163446535	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.469924387101	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.317404804939	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.5	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.455328968867	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.315615871564	in particular.
0.0	0.413852250863	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.438417410482	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.290281024504	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.442883560005	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
1.0	0.803272218151	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.372548002644	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.467388590601	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.446403839257	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.444498105963	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.483353948626	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.513026998299	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.4659644701	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.461945985728	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.462094619567	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.428750950357	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.5	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.362314665655	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.403857674457	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.488708325839	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.440457643601	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.479325035556	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.253003407307	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.411835214926	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.258702667998	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.5	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.402477390559	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.469393549001	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.406142684055	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.403218506674	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.444283594107	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.422303457596	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.412760635584	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.

0.0	0.494398627153	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.

0.0	0.373757406837	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.302529760317	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.344851184943	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.

0.0	0.193445415684	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.439193572439	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.458251113365	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.257622236912	How do I know this?
0.0	0.344241353382	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.373630896673	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.476634737895	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.379525470095	Now, he's doing better.

0.0	0.224015567205	You're welcome.
0.0	0.5	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.441855726744	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.481038497643	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.222926414143	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.421327496844	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.0823424494783	...Thank you.
0.0	0.452218602828	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.

0.0	0.608283901376	I do.
0.0	0.438430832841	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.5	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.

0.0	0.430367234634	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.482160020045	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.366044014718	You can't deal in China without tariffs.

0.0	0.370569031408	That will change everything.

0.0	0.455727870746	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?

0.0	0.4480062399	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.444733325899	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.367085589168	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.45768757799	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.261472064654	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.303136903817	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
1.0	0.794923823283	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.363456265814	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.385683600006	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.372759730345	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.49393890709	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.424955831671	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.527461644672	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.469285832127	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.397674477779	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.463361983681	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.398045386494	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.443796431995	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.454766121283	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.423955793361	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.490471649055	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
1.0	0.751674460866	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.445509015826	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.341752507154	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.472247877982	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.322980118692	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.336840098928	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.441416399476	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.397393518862	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.472170538866	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.420470800885	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.245092268854	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.418347458644	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.467373615563	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.24243596581	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.508432729949	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.416052679178	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.42216533012	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.398788800917	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.381448338485	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.219146966096	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.302563903798	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.608283901376	...
0.0	0.300831442106	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.218572975054	The answer is no.
0.0	0.373934430352	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.253125836608	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.450074107035	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.5169011635	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.4641966217	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.448677017749	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.493916340969	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.5	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.320703039715	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.382753746503	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.48368097154	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.394962454074	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.460138231665	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.471883572906	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.403541665604	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.350404771862	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.480613197178	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.310254361799	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.373703082704	I never said that.
0.0	0.375884616271	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
1.0	0.307784377363	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.394704357467	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.429003510348	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.440720411488	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.472406967925	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.374065278405	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.380930557227	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.361050165652	I said temporarily.
1.0	0.518675476726	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.439179021414	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.396638407283	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.267066040093	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.470713167019	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.239790854113	You bet they do.
0.0	0.441027257431	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.252283212729	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.288872135065	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.197264096029	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.297228201931	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.362723756695	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.342208639098	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.373326256909	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.356338047935	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.176408160652	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.270424186652	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.411568861859	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
1.0	0.807747298223	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.388390528961	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.414636450347	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
1.0	0.816874406553	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.466504603232	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.427473440812	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.487036066478	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.608283901376	No.
0.0	0.469097634115	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.374724048907	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.320983300229	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.452836832913	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.343099751989	And he was a managing general partner.
1.0	0.771497047325	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.425170797221	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.426110048659	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.472491708862	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.467525480432	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.346425769146	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.386285095469	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.492193855808	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.395914551961	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.320703039715	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.426537601686	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.317885971482	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
1.0	0.73734106595	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.394672097542	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.43261600461	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.416759378131	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.35297970984	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.428017235746	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.415390503922	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.22015577574	I will do that.
