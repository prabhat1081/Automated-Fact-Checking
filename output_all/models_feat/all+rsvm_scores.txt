0.0	0.656993560853	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.53548660078	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.433661218636	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.78265912654	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.440620436985	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.221736180174	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.414916769833	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.58128691564	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.3553186976	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.153288678041	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.617945568401	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.284709251262	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.227516516108	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.320416237547	In addition to that...
0.0	0.18744142697	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.343713320478	Yeah.
0.0	0.5	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.492240198737	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.4779124519	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.316137016134	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.273322388165	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.357772726864	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.344568671105	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.395114003984	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.172458414179	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.352014874736	Thank you.
0.0	0.475461972327	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.477612631172	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.533955198748	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.522799379507	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.256966607538	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.787005021316	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.251006978397	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.312111441065	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.283265632147	I like it.
0.0	0.402856805941	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.566259095771	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.386508940813	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.203764497715	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.553159892704	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.35497815821	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.391593372132	It's a joke.
0.0	0.450463688926	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.264594499574	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.773190089031	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.304448674794	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.27510088119	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.211888421672	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.255044826559	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.436675150392	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.39124746113	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.372806464604	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.144802905503	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.605741411265	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.252365406612	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.129068340452	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.384791908567	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.460737068944	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.658193276161	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.515582475458	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.438059280434	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.445220184718	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.28221373485	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.333702309745	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.440879864474	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.152228698129	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.204697493708	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.198929485475	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.560926018655	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.387667345419	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.265060505753	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.359452691333	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.715185204729	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.37667930879	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.640696644667	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.435417025661	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.202319677445	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.606290085808	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.726176285698	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.2857951538	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.282080634202	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.448950550596	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.157786537424	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.76397656695	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.277347853922	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.63841688712	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.174942533676	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.352014874736	Thank you.
0.0	0.41105212891	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.317197041325	Check it out.
0.0	0.434939162944	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.0420227360395	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.280206108378	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.376188191245	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.662651752795	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.593565294725	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.545773890105	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.427943267988	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.251668801576	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.5	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.279629109622	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.367602027104	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.242077194024	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.585730105255	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.128455697273	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.328157712598	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.293770781341	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.119877114189	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.508797804582	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.538453942436	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.573819706996	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.252504867987	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.37910169632	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
1.0	0.527050756008	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.388212785869	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.344244285046	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.522673463174	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.298079559706	Well, sure.
0.0	0.361448336738	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.386450622755	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.491479702058	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.19906439971	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.316527256748	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.352014874736	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.176378251066	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.511906789279	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.400434545048	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.366368379927	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.343447483057	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.673031688077	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.568143033473	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.56992933977	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
1.0	0.812254698542	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.520640756893	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.24857656068	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.317596323937	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.381610317051	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.191119939769	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.433572346986	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.34694159188	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.50886547324	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.331299418176	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.225238799865	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.27242792008	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.396842086765	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.176900855562	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.111644073819	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.58446468597	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.538969498605	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.40274540669	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.696875834746	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.52951326204	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.451143576587	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.316281931063	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.386263977368	No.
0.0	0.279237610903	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.508519689756	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.715575465533	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.121924907719	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.465466392982	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.520231899733	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.382285012048	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.417372784035	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.398149624168	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.726476859669	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.394801682094	You count on it.
0.0	0.203160377693	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.320697390928	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.549968248851	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.224933214813	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.539884973342	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.58994719018	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.421506406561	It's their money.
0.0	0.16243180429	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.53710038804	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.639887928732	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.33849124301	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.174644001093	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.400396564233	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.158438782913	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.583022722168	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.280997420573	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.523222128765	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.65666890627	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.616605125886	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.365368906892	So you might not.
0.0	0.706536199615	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.490752468546	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.626792008587	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.461832816404	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.414221206043	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.385743656437	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.301616127567	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.593198071012	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.567784308015	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.441595899426	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.514739217557	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.091436508514	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.558481315051	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.0674346281885	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.

0.0	0.521288442283	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.30890476313	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.411738166318	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.735899270326	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
1.0	0.593123829516	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.68060168757	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.39656030498	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.258100866544	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.69291750797	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.400803270124	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.439294408814	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.758167292929	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.231778695257	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.762000177065	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.345446745458	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.215610410774	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.466404704865	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.715713105143	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.

0.0	0.536187419912	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.254330026114	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.

0.0	0.131018894988	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.368295735793	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
1.0	0.236919270827	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.34913159151	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.195858701734	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.352014874736	Thank you.
0.0	0.316433519344	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.243531413547	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.505058072779	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.153940845183	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.741308563057	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.616283924127	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.170600254749	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.604244879834	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.49031288457	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.0702834250873	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.52137988619	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.460591101028	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.819189254821	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.451446329407	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.872690181467	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.362063265835	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.258854818841	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.38386360304	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.383267864353	You know why three?
0.0	0.229577661441	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.595653938199	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.871940285642	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.431790055347	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.541712956879	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.482728386428	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.487400979722	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.187798323792	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
1.0	0.613058422636	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.567857149217	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.365945957508	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.193662201878	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.281957137934	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.40635422375	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.368197878063	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.717554373275	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.352007759486	Illegal.
0.0	0.138778850492	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.0991790514485	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.202150672017	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.363245654596	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.225298063883	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.244086757006	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.422517547566	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.765142411911	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.407744872584	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.42597899428	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.433479290175	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.440687723525	White people?
0.0	0.408248714055	But I would add this.
0.0	0.186504520115	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
1.0	0.774494773628	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.343777262199	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.294273530275	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.361857547181	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.525382169025	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.287099757315	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.278566210331	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.40146555499	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.469839803586	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.459048679096	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.470060027741	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.300490569344	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.291665567591	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.479449184469	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.168542064395	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.409873065719	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.157352212675	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.257902618742	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.805728710021	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.307326636357	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.724944713108	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.474424119692	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.593399711725	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.060551936863	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.219749117883	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.426724970337	I never said that.
0.0	0.461866748358	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.287075457833	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.234744154662	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.586533489698	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.31614822898	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.380115130573	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.356727182616	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.389263494956	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.480782136787	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.254211189014	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.412941841963	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.431548396617	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.653826314421	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.26719588671	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.380050747751	Right.
0.0	0.487302339556	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.406867366693	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.536824325147	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.37288701144	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.536769461833	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.375788239269	I win.
0.0	0.453508785781	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.216253551109	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.346545909385	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.508192003666	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.522353061038	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.403095403405	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.370128055133	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.0434441249432	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.669239083216	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.379615162475	John?
0.0	0.354864415242	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.459813913742	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.0577220891097	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.213193443694	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.466065263922	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.367406668107	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.582448909744	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.428979345462	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.435360383389	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.445657137782	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.442678141987	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.174712257743	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.59455535137	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.623931746881	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.436039274994	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.417629475281	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.161219525384	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.392976436543	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.137656882183	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.588014162816	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.264404453725	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.63730649203	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.389993391887	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.204692354032	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.50573425843	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.284396160831	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.208434369903	I would just say that...
0.0	0.429703322934	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.438697716634	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.419364840135	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.561474280203	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.369368929174	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
1.0	0.494115389712	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
1.0	0.566378651024	Very few children.
0.0	0.314971292521	No vision at all.
0.0	0.588972755506	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.450103785909	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.435596224664	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.607380953262	I said no.
0.0	0.449788787988	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.457451496883	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.700753857709	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.21001868206	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
1.0	0.766830667145	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.655099295085	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.380325097541	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.444873439466	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.484855304176	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.282566541862	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.401253334888	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.517492343852	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.38632649018	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.331324390488	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
1.0	0.838706332055	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.233754920717	I mean, you know...

0.0	0.288449759917	That's who's in my mind

0.0	0.238709162717	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.666002799333	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
1.0	0.925475680685	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.381329147821	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.

0.0	0.4280882583	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.19217760081	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.

0.0	0.458899550847	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.16285111211	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.518488740074	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.352497363122	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.484943318739	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.645001836009	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.5	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.317832419128	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.201202109613	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.62460175284	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.312284319898	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.735233680792	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.373471366282	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.436758634317	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.311178081618	We don't win.
0.0	0.637739014239	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.0830476498131	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.37430981796	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.674917258596	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.754220990382	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.282533553673	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.360746929792	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.45477207164	I didn't.
0.0	0.352281661809	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.36001433707	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.145916652491	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.479153870083	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.210236396479	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.44346269808	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.340429749846	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.226790931793	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.600379353907	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.2323352924	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.605531633897	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.138048478366	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.256359426044	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.820823053076	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.183133602756	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.409110308575	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.574200983112	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.119208886814	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.405041064355	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.597790647082	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.335408138691	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.411219611805	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.00798747864625	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.364892679605	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.388166002779	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.435480448181	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.508225291809	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.556151778699	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.218667527161	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.400163531853	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.168571121117	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.407609895666	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.32979476645	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.267842196125	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.609570304159	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.435989614929	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.567259462946	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.43143770478	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.387088278143	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.5	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.486676448891	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.458586638028	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.347441473666	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.258721280984	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.268882070405	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.613232844911	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.338215018363	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.578508047879	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.450739471014	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.203992471997	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.5	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.517594491863	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.206627773887	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.379615162475	John.
0.0	0.179857201924	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.34388135721	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.314795737355	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.297179886229	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.464538441918	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.408157158558	He's wrong.
0.0	0.45238372772	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.222179999514	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.434826614201	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.586677464656	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.527176933442	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.182816984845	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.336432291546	in particular.
0.0	0.631443298633	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.178571475609	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.44674210686	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.38946164384	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.267842746029	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.275819956236	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.258702758407	No, it's true.
0.0	0.225294458329	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.84058499498	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.457016023485	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.427066087429	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.282311356831	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.458354540797	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.203189528253	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.463948890559	So we have a good group of people.
1.0	0.363005284959	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.249333506851	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.547935657687	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.700467123606	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.651669629044	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.195317967648	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.487182081384	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.209769591262	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.528906419591	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.476625698994	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.370331999912	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.708126814942	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.245901627334	I totally get that.
0.0	0.386263977368	No.
0.0	0.523289302836	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.650979727682	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.290531704986	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.468530627616	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.291528672822	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.359835745578	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.609440835309	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.717118679485	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.298508541791	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.54017298994	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.556532035816	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.374749036076	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.238519616907	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.223376111719	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.675840473833	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.477827092501	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.43387760243	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
1.0	0.5	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.263643063521	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.447466821416	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.627359819483	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.367278092996	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.5	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.441661549473	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.400725697887	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.343713320478	Yes.
0.0	0.421116610193	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.352014874736	Thank you.
0.0	0.365814775592	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.18215095411	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.390737186398	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.394649917176	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.266542591524	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.383233529494	It is.
0.0	0.376001765044	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.309510147622	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.337812848922	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.329128369217	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.796879502918	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.362343207637	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.562577523996	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.377681396967	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.34502434605	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.634269569696	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.838647048013	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.253652312644	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.521584203304	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.464650331801	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.434285201017	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.558316293877	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.234849507911	...
0.0	0.40192109311	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.563757308782	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.206854641219	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.385201848875	You looking at me?
0.0	0.440851592986	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.5	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.615006597711	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.405177077736	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.0407573531857	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.445593350732	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.487275795103	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.583473079247	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.282851996757	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.58938323164	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.372177064987	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.218652980891	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.298512492727	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.536541041268	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.352014874736	Thank you.
0.0	0.309824564901	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.307217183302	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
1.0	0.634665715599	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.201708834433	...John...
0.0	0.573870009001	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.36249474716	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.414561245801	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.355438944215	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
1.0	0.5	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.64437092832	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.284843907353	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.191233081003	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.197519878773	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.369572579071	I love China.
0.0	0.722572832177	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.222696029276	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.52170848322	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.460251096251	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.410950742363	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.58013224457	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.671295966475	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.166101491125	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.374145896406	I do.
0.0	0.427696692339	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.209234178705	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.386263977368	No.
0.0	0.171006864385	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.337291885572	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.396368202872	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.265789080668	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.666324852769	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.466910159349	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.379389259465	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.708335987358	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.618728132599	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.557897241403	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.51088479199	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.579466146187	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.261074531572	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
1.0	0.344244739112	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.365702888402	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.555414672793	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.634442739693	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.736977472429	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.376108146057	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.656084650839	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.472146433922	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.43339046215	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.487658290804	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.380050747751	Dynamically.
0.0	0.302127144595	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.412009653861	OK, good.
0.0	0.162673804557	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.230694920062	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.479073473956	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.272010009504	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.378475101564	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.544325033429	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.23122700175	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.724322286639	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.217408166085	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.123442145776	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.362439945239	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.547909890055	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.28003247963	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.322001923172	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.747185691269	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.665150410363	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.251489745321	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.409712546139	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.343713320478	Yes.
0.0	0.0709373466106	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.782055655566	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.230211581165	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.293890373012	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.413548803249	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.512377357356	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.27222732745	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.411747551795	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.589822256195	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.348232182798	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.240098066499	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.302914300743	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.5	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.575052124721	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.541720443233	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.40950859735	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.246668522118	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.505962589541	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.225384138297	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.644670385203	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.380050747751	Right.
0.0	0.669935155511	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.345197093148	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.19541270463	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.433775281121	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.378571522927	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.113504785626	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
1.0	0.444169173067	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.293616327295	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.549764641386	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.373667518839	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.338335872279	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.352014874736	Thank you.
0.0	0.845339481265	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.820823053076	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.611048083871	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.29903034716	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.365888769282	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.577246658495	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.834606417578	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.790333347939	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.391171612301	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.246413301162	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.26167315596	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.597633859398	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.49355997143	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.656239492739	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.428237141598	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.586691555259	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.24338482577	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.382656419736	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.422730725314	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.431052621343	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.126255155527	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.449106817823	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.857901363161	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.386717186315	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.535898567584	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.451849902657	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.563698779995	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.277445191821	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.199916242767	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.426964313664	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.812606128677	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.247733322382	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.378359424737	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.594271216299	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.875141430019	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.222310233522	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.109830234457	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.587090557955	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.371407766525	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.401789577781	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.269907155182	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.435842028612	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.718843300855	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.193510703513	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.40279285734	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.212157280411	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.651906104987	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.312914422902	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.321141273406	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.404188377489	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.270369441381	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.39851573533	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.279500035353	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.278876215707	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.246608983111	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.261782602302	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.55132101527	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.34607352766	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.933803122714	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.386676093415	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.516674773319	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.223735133874	I understand.
0.0	0.345331080657	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.655929519504	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.555629136948	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.440499833126	That's not true.
0.0	0.516202279646	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.661287863075	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.255931139619	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.220222119176	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.478307624012	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.5	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.299125883941	My point is this.
0.0	0.444747983887	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.660565220089	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.468882217822	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.286182837001	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.699261800828	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.458976001958	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.311141683074	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.5	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.49163547237	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.551790976431	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
1.0	0.644215076914	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.267180347396	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.340904883369	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.423566131735	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.42643513034	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.192215239642	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.434569747572	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.0855100783436	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.726726671947	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.5	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.537565560434	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.55853061512	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.624304748669	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.343713320478	OK.
0.0	0.553540678715	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.441343940065	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.349823395905	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.279008554112	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.47720874617	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.418098776567	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.471636164896	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.159235895665	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.558727030395	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.452679471441	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.471382722563	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.361385156454	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.247733322382	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.302010273738	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.397179926282	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.251352991092	That is...
0.0	0.424906906732	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.323260368966	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.750678473963	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.694022818226	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.322127207457	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.372431278715	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.289753771297	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.143607043141	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.61792803603	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.305988055468	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.307636485658	You're welcome.
0.0	0.5	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.331063833849	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
1.0	0.818645397641	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.477045886948	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.372802768175	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.267080762398	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.365213686095	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.21714854207	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.265425766611	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.370347863138	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.299711145724	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.548218661168	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.450690746482	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.781964599015	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.441305981917	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.535789283695	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.168309750337	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.574936985868	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.374145896406	We do.
0.0	0.416586804781	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.4280882583	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.155177487395	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.515248221752	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.515484636976	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.369176187339	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.208275765309	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.234523914419	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.450717972815	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.512610195581	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.770837117321	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.246805586075	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.124024899424	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.343713320478	OK?
0.0	0.413455420892	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.821316222046	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.345931882992	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.617309028523	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.452188702979	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.444761604183	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.59459754711	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.274401746977	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.764451539378	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.391358887074	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.260940965875	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.246459736564	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.478764642603	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.473926529498	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.0759668344848	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.356756067623	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
1.0	0.294714153579	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.46928049105	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.329176867912	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.0747366959809	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.340201044609	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.310539578473	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.257567900062	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.531035304468	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.151457497439	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.589013195846	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.357588547732	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.708116665339	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.319888865115	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.541355241913	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.240383211864	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.562532921597	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.478713807371	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.535880654119	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.460647449302	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.291168282791	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.481661158049	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.383267864353	You know why three?
0.0	0.55187371656	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.676933745923	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.490866704031	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.44124420962	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.563002353494	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.553068007154	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.198131143425	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.303436589373	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
1.0	0.439151259274	That's wrong.
0.0	0.588100178563	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.523462774686	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.389853905272	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.429332066009	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.589196781418	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.292999140795	Let em also tell you...
1.0	0.507629314139	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.412653966541	And you know what?
0.0	0.690617457368	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.816191982568	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.166378438968	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
1.0	0.784500999176	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.309672870581	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.272523041301	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.33668105155	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.0390505979039	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.170380891568	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.425745391947	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.891611132596	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.197849455522	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.636909127659	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.646599946396	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
1.0	0.628730039979	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.398237789027	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
1.0	0.604121481086	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.412165072739	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.440129760195	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.343713320478	OK?
0.0	0.26463673661	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.63244398574	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.417175212597	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.51426216914	They were wrong.
1.0	0.562721606364	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.597908991543	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.5	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.482329161527	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.363143514442	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.410943384626	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.311973020178	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.644934132709	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.194581562957	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.469393947217	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.136086644929	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.152301159621	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.454443983862	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.51297994148	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.100446669932	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.322544323782	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.182740569434	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.553933377417	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.389996700283	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.468366375105	That is our government today.
0.0	0.466406698257	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.23126162332	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.386263977368	No.
0.0	0.318951131388	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.112332580937	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.33129906283	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.192215239642	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.525938477639	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.359963621043	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.47312814022	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.21146105962	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.244902570113	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.933323804729	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.766505307625	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.363307013566	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.234569689311	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.

0.0	0.365048470318	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.724153551506	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.

0.0	0.131969498353	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.

0.0	0.178269246491	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.963842596536	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.778381169689	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.

0.0	0.220956743398	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.0825699982275	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.5	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.

0.0	0.441783633769	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?

0.0	0.645700514107	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.465766896627	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.425388030971	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.618661998176	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.

0.0	0.406576808558	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.537740140376	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
1.0	0.219569196098	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.227972049057	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.449715828007	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.603125340622	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.382307217084	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.21398924033	But look...
0.0	0.0866817195042	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.449915840044	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.493400900797	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.433687749886	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
1.0	0.506422398276	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.191043308067	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.207829748932	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.0953537567635	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.344833836018	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.533343899577	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.461474011933	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.270118564565	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.412653966541	And you know what?
0.0	0.255434844764	You just want to...
0.0	0.36743111436	You can have him.
0.0	0.213245657291	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.47560378155	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.278341027648	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.180483404137	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.767075072148	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
1.0	0.515370397159	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.520008895138	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.427229375975	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.535395163353	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.414849235691	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.428000312395	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.147697062559	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.316142843231	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.5	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.39423913246	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.593590022693	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.252872545944	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.177069296645	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.450445482604	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.634643550449	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.490701142448	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.372860794462	They're a scam.
0.0	0.118412359381	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.395429299563	That's not right.
0.0	0.793133314222	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.138955355683	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.298113869269	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.412753210699	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.946625454474	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.272418962783	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.580100821248	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.151944956414	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.248273752095	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.533973975406	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.311781392048	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.534532508579	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.427547691275	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.5	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.466749655199	I was not at all.
0.0	0.414053672185	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.518527128075	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.369434464579	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.305869791245	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.863993730064	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.577883139789	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.505384512071	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.21786689734	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.414122586489	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.903786300999	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.193767595193	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.413597458722	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.0616809013385	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.737057392756	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.201708834433	...Chris...
1.0	0.519500233032	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.450681432589	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.20834414216	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
1.0	0.679925608651	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
1.0	0.537989969433	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.420821491193	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.239660864151	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.396285457351	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.333225355947	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.0654262321822	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.40975246273	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.124412845289	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.463921629286	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.319676162479	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.338345138103	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.380961833567	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.0637582539747	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.36477621187	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.186833997583	And guess what?
0.0	0.162005899461	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.701481670999	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.464455841572	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.634468392412	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.329732290271	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.510612186507	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.353746112337	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.609464013558	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.490355748009	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.467174420117	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.613401794123	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.222618382389	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.440099702988	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.22188488688	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.306837961346	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.19738974054	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.31962154472	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.271894896639	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.426929838081	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.261417074288	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.51858522861	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.462189615803	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.4039817154	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.184575057418	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.352014874736	Thank you.
0.0	0.266070359554	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.295092694482	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.425978256726	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.584803533526	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.

0.0	0.240783575599	How do I know this?
0.0	0.341998467352	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.471394690733	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.407681865994	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.350959811609	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.424414384153	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.

0.0	0.52951326204	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.316564345543	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.364142896735	Let's talk about our campaigns.
1.0	0.573263777784	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.391236009948	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.167815390952	Let people play, who cares?
1.0	0.684598989883	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.137632414582	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.5	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.483506644445	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.550330954066	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.232966598205	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.405379010603	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.41721356241	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.343713320478	Yeah.
0.0	0.388504502452	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.558747735035	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.0338427817206	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.378801875834	They're off to China.
0.0	0.57580214908	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.402337933362	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.395429299563	That's not right.
0.0	0.613986373134	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.289605750283	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.487328593821	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.159817569798	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.801502971801	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
1.0	0.800322482513	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.1595825093	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.275819956236	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.52887837268	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.482840229488	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.692855540842	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.352014874736	Thank you.
0.0	0.34953245708	Can we stop?
0.0	0.088160343866	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.388642233336	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.345277739072	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.21107752673	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.506743825283	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.115726549055	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.402341810913	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.244307836911	Becky --
0.0	0.494358656811	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.239689030907	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.236515890265	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.469395951731	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.290772943247	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.438787049151	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.340239255078	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.5	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.355118735536	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.34136158012	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.455559660724	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.347402211653	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.636227741955	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.481883946174	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.38268537095	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.285199571242	They have a responsibility, as well.
1.0	0.669118009245	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.283237003031	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.645834182628	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.384627781072	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.613632830719	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.388253625769	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.353193036641	What have you got now?

0.0	0.192655130145	And...
1.0	0.78936803581	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.933407223248	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.22575818526	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.179879876557	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.417163728668	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.138060723347	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.20619757362	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
1.0	0.378946008716	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.544817133225	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.263835635052	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.408945740303	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.0625617229411	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.284636943194	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.383449800776	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.256480642849	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.214856482268	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
1.0	0.749913740418	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.603063126383	Two points.
0.0	0.412653966541	And you know what?
0.0	0.251623618963	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.978008077485	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.208334680098	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.194704267174	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.5	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.425017209956	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.309186864399	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.409330127805	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.293464369861	What should we do?
0.0	0.374500321147	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.215997308172	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.279693666042	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.352886502236	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.763716519478	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.317107248654	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.398816336204	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.436786923656	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.451950968528	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.510268480638	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.547350489852	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.223033004517	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.293445675722	You know why?
0.0	0.21676190597	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.4453991281	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.715741949944	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.480209042139	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.511807463242	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.302324023656	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.801044245623	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.206396482495	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.29630021288	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.55331098981	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.256188305834	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.387092770134	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.334989940171	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.331248316941	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.656367532614	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.386263977368	No.
0.0	0.371662693528	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
1.0	0.705871020666	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.432237245068	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.433438263578	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.80312302256	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.600216502002	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.207020190432	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.349460466505	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.453814635777	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.260605781525	Why is that?
0.0	0.228162874424	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.365196343593	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.721519821427	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.544500421684	That's the difference.
0.0	0.463162376215	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.25664730161	I agree with them.
0.0	0.380050747751	Right.
0.0	0.391163636745	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.558182652617	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.0891204442632	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.317850118775	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.390478854271	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.702107703545	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.27808472392	We don't need that.
0.0	0.75549887996	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.611432262943	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.48464511381	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.404471964867	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.345918001808	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.353311698989	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.658675559398	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.449585817029	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.350994028738	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.36398615904	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.431566700569	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.151521593848	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.21268826908	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.334225216404	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.438444238142	My background is different.
0.0	0.408244599582	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.5	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.203067045268	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.689867532503	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.649431733179	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.5	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.513165666124	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.454574327423	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.390129493521	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.608097018794	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.60123066168	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.171960003129	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.156806985505	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.240797662969	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.357048816656	I was the architect.
0.0	0.413393975018	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.355410740078	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.291682768946	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.23328632344	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.5538146089	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.448230582856	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.658368991444	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.522259003496	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.32998993451	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.519861812284	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.329881230993	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.410501742621	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.2588579631	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.307914399547	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.84480724085	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.560119259793	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.36874688576	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.37891739834	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.477549426834	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.516012147103	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.480187911483	We both want to get more revenue in.
1.0	0.859268576985	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.422269254564	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.646181792762	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.401544984738	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.439524822637	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.44266928339	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.39963756916	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.244307836911	Neil...
0.0	0.469297069095	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.526280902751	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.579164886655	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.5	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.529753323552	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.249710761004	These...
0.0	0.293851879628	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.304045576963	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.252370820512	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.645524835403	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.5	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.312442881912	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.585897899818	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.277865344953	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.338222572473	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.138340444943	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.29923030099	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.642848092757	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.489737694677	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.474795480484	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.252924367472	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.421987558934	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.40825863475	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.393673060328	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.443041971047	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.492436383483	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.509984218054	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.54466996227	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.208464440305	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.423707206479	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.221364578644	And, thank you everybody.
1.0	0.83163443053	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.464979866105	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.625762001858	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.345285193842	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.328884187078	And I have many great Muslim friends.
1.0	0.456383849022	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.178284360238	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.481447496132	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.588557381522	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.343713320478	Yes.
0.0	0.708840746201	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.246286409774	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.363692366159	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.535110957333	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.584481811021	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.286236598478	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.

0.0	0.0590455789511	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.246902587046	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.468422368555	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.610350279602	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.

0.0	0.10153979381	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.

0.0	0.219706586387	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.538163391075	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.

0.0	0.45477207164	She was right.
0.0	0.177350262396	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.278681161541	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.25395180689	So I have voiced criticisms.

0.0	0.523142116366	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.426724970337	I never said that.
0.0	0.372303111479	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.207514740977	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.478716354015	That is important.
0.0	0.439225522853	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
1.0	0.651547091577	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.447138551045	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.

0.0	0.467571925399	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.317427534372	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.274314044532	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.671508554189	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.647808895236	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.

0.0	0.437098611504	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.493557224741	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.267035011019	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.

0.0	0.0218033812703	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
1.0	0.612362109874	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.605013506034	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.

1.0	0.188438932728	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.234849507911	...
0.0	0.41870986321	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.

0.0	0.490533795019	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.462476496729	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.688096122569	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.

0.0	0.482482880137	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.297696050643	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.309947414836	But I want to go further.

0.0	0.625379676005	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.316473597245	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.643791979689	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.402578253352	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
1.0	0.319639011016	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.448006766375	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.333945493173	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.367338428478	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.568502394472	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.625406148173	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.433803843967	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.165184378703	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.277724120876	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.316026455654	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.567643693695	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.353118352102	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.547005952525	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.355935194587	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.427295811663	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.193611259379	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
1.0	0.790230135586	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.189960807473	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.140893763562	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.205392917489	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.480779912407	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.291090675663	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.545485245381	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.454299070012	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.328214672924	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.47696371379	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.741987218122	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.873464017574	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.624414010364	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.505082054539	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.212142250596	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.234849507911	...
0.0	0.333120853976	See?
0.0	0.37090226085	You don't have to.
1.0	0.618343705008	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.292969104123	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.425318856841	I know every one.
0.0	0.201091698287	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.454399552323	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.152961343949	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.530042500854	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.691483385402	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.275255259672	Our next president...
0.0	0.323479130618	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.481103113888	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.863333761649	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.0752109053633	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.222802277472	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.286985238958	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.313915720691	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.21568158944	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.563262272923	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.307497705196	That's for sure.
0.0	0.574924711629	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.455408012063	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.490544156174	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.59375790833	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.47638376856	That's my bill.
0.0	0.23660176011	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.173955605443	I think you're --
0.0	0.323589502299	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.445785681467	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.421889662207	That's right.
0.0	0.512456492914	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.449196438158	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.0729811051484	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.158580153211	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.534347869496	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.238213291249	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.15054832898	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.402744669094	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.23913900202	You bet they do.
0.0	0.810964126279	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.359164721012	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.344149904533	I've laid out...
0.0	0.349615714692	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.464921744148	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.412149660727	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.468561779414	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.573839327805	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.370280551552	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.568975393814	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.109444164326	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.484982055741	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.389155302485	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.342833601638	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.214493537179	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.562470525036	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.974197909226	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.329275100172	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.342342415659	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.163868485346	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.398253385376	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.464918954371	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.5	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.295441752758	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.474356631269	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.352014874736	Thank you.
0.0	0.327420021115	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.293243084989	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.837373716155	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.183820452402	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.22744269836	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.413075765467	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.297566947514	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.378358819487	Here's the problem.
1.0	0.64566070823	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.201708834433	...Chris...
0.0	0.386263977368	No.
0.0	0.412167486075	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.0994798761672	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.141017010427	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.647981605521	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.393413229563	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.312181304219	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.615591668756	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.151309535716	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.793953995283	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.255885151526	Big difference.
0.0	0.406654572394	I got that.
0.0	0.529592720324	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.40220129857	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.143845290677	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.395973483323	Creativity.
0.0	0.125370333377	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.360179912512	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.200053198207	I want security.
0.0	0.207805446704	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.315566986383	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.5	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.52532593213	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.381080314094	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.576485226947	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.644564296961	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.281393395025	This will end.
0.0	0.334970500543	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.5	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
1.0	0.547403092247	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.555290545179	That's what I said.
0.0	0.352014874736	Thank you.
0.0	0.224329310661	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.638217721571	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.5	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.1561983482	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.567028785075	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.445296742393	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.395780123381	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.386263977368	No.
0.0	0.431685029012	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.549754124223	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.208168406979	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.361600494201	And we are not England.
0.0	0.630961720237	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.426724970337	I never said that.
0.0	0.165557558764	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.408118247831	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.248083531043	How great is that?
0.0	0.481123322899	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.242451216324	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.624129264196	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.364037190208	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.538646172136	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.591133697217	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.566474882473	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.18723823276	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.352562546116	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.53044568688	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.641414374915	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.204103493488	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.492631069719	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.264312416442	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.511428568156	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.239276637264	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.44388014061	No, you did.
0.0	0.465699755038	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.48962833569	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.232224790862	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.233546643083	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.32889662323	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.211500151782	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.404934680591	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.539344814828	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.198403772331	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.666959322594	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.344005484861	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.376966048221	I can.
0.0	0.624771798029	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.151187892246	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.720611345284	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.332471442568	He undermines it.
0.0	0.308836425697	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.298440309444	This country is changing.
0.0	0.488973563126	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.30731642144	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.440390787079	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.455633642615	We pay federal taxes.
1.0	0.575427877832	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.336207332538	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.339379340479	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.265293346937	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.493777996151	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."

0.0	0.429897586073	I got the briefings.

0.0	0.0822617790537	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.162463854564	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.486070185227	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.312120036046	The answer is no.
0.0	0.233625848975	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.821022642071	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.309809739299	I think he is right.
0.0	0.346354918133	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.490850497729	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.345604718997	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.564677115912	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.

0.0	0.264547012365	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.563484749638	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.281095197183	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.400710282982	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.563484678676	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.379615162475	Alright.
0.0	0.199895217876	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.534608676634	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.718771445674	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.

0.0	0.253648922737	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.360152302551	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.385356546655	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.416530970632	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.572265667225	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.397692994599	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.101752586086	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.8862931772	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.431122365121	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.645988707895	Of course not.
0.0	0.62438193711	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.354148841844	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.332983131109	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.536564165092	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.460198511476	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.668089756706	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.488504724992	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.548036690838	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.253071386398	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.489869075146	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.

0.0	0.343713320478	Yes.
0.0	0.422760300434	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.

0.0	0.584728614511	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.45499772784	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.57400565314	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.

0.0	0.5	I changed that.
0.0	0.234849507911	...
0.0	0.346826478018	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.459755485728	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.427282811781	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.519658435954	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.470608082937	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.

0.0	0.305033423347	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.

0.0	0.42205366011	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.597758127175	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.191721649805	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.289467967371	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...

0.0	0.309956823884	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.420053252093	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
1.0	0.582781427712	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.458846721902	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.523741174783	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.5726259353	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.406415047655	This is 2016.
0.0	0.410241253393	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.112495312392	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.182884645776	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.418289713155	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.379791501324	We have no borders.
0.0	0.118875413256	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.340620990804	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.335753429763	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.257775446548	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.235684819122	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.337407055848	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.4280882583	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.478356409109	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.347351699377	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.574538554682	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.592890847931	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.120038036464	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.262269763382	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.685854305543	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.300208759497	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.27510088119	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.465342842739	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.231245080916	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.650260521251	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.787040961562	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.412619212819	We are not France.
0.0	0.631306001426	The world has changed.
0.0	0.27451343405	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.756399207362	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.726663957342	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.454734654268	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.392888282851	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.527915653637	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.483712898118	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.597352887096	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.508688827556	You're simply not.
0.0	0.391904534393	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.371394587265	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
1.0	0.925025935895	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.445245644819	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.165668693333	It should be what are your substantive positions...
1.0	0.576863182988	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.302779613078	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.635891535756	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.179637647162	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.137299159973	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.50967051437	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.515568608709	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.489475230838	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.393333026436	We haven't.
0.0	0.537246420375	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.580558003977	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.355269834725	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.103301986648	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.33090543882	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.469715759779	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.245087295738	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.0434919112554	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.542830990693	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.432032381697	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.251141299017	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.268733241912	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.412074693576	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.232144013698	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.545678048411	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.307299900116	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.429096855177	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.245211457907	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.466490888205	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.437826546956	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.351557542585	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.839507623108	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.249131628521	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.37924546172	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.224763231359	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.208984533971	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.486190224432	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.111726833033	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.350892637515	Say again?
0.0	0.096336069175	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.421548318473	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.594219914673	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.637153459502	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.411539161117	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
1.0	0.476970983918	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.205946047682	... he's really doing some bad...
1.0	0.572326087518	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.567723928886	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.574685361503	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.365256070529	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.300753789332	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.256379545452	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.0828427867817	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.153935278797	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.395835686579	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.435509028128	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.378966015101	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.437989705776	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
1.0	0.703978581319	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.211074908593	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.726901009365	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.608955431817	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.540966526662	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.297408667516	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.764386620832	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.522176759334	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.426212703462	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.354295937011	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.524814661345	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.140914611934	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.244846161102	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.635262935898	I was mentioned in the question.

0.0	0.486354606285	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.318711171181	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.521739389584	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.622594618878	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.548668169096	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.277331287837	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.297008963157	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.689095719035	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.0411345620252	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.334956917395	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.30873754271	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.175584363434	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.583302441034	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.45431047088	I've done it.
0.0	0.391874114396	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.448292505121	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.479340769177	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.411875361734	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.509913024081	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.143855306833	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.292562809041	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.273403559067	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.415878209417	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.403540603027	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.4190107875	On welfare.
1.0	0.682753971533	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.349065045151	You know that.
0.0	0.760002562299	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.42259673886	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.530165263537	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.290133162296	They have to come into this country legally.

0.0	0.229126564496	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.201059474373	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.42841944683	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
1.0	0.758224704905	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.482417337891	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.757450749334	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.440509330854	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.364151989461	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.320864727765	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.364423228376	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.0974907716515	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.402695152381	It never happens.
0.0	0.490853287331	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.344493830573	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.239175875419	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.529159472797	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.304997489506	HEMMER: Wow.
1.0	0.5	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.463298329268	I'm ready.
0.0	0.467827503132	They're a scam.
0.0	0.601252859471	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.612107763704	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.231818460466	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.565584509381	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.630440755838	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.661843347747	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.867587233175	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.486717432304	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.149050654344	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.624534767699	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.219876916373	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.61372113601	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.323058437544	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.333213330675	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.678804077346	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.424621498571	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.33266246863	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.354053112469	I am against the raids.
1.0	0.480871088198	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.229373848867	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.251633743425	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.176667013554	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.674619715126	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.379596678012	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.0651618694931	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.258337491784	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.400171496353	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.914002662387	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.37745739332	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.234018671398	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.401792155707	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.467612566469	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.421229440106	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.439333453051	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.322843927271	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.863913077684	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.771872453863	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.601695339716	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.845111393653	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.513742468955	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.263752583562	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.301096336891	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.480215765478	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.41016288773	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.829150199995	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.804037058025	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.483856869659	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.158273389909	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.456691562628	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.564755835178	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
1.0	0.640741195424	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.251058482956	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.436831560964	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.44995345091	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.641028032791	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.248118186121	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.647062968807	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
1.0	0.80582762478	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.5	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.189123508675	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.284103241305	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.281487327	Why?
0.0	0.419456693485	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.528666417481	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.410553662796	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.160427709591	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.120417744114	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.383658571089	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.263849521152	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.399270429554	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.47341596951	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.520943698556	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.0900336635557	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.218825642535	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.410487140069	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.363843337122	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.339384848761	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.487369793403	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.576602958783	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.438137944866	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.695778066037	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.395328874042	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.570384141805	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.226896875127	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.184465665394	Came out great.
0.0	0.66351777269	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.477702380526	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.219883550917	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.573279570385	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.620689657171	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
1.0	0.650298821371	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.545844012685	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.0975203362082	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.700395402766	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.284651266188	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.33604951759	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.614239172671	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.478843639641	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.810514245292	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.432408446433	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.419948937789	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.522422321069	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.485060318117	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.788390192952	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.532449786124	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.689720026275	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.615007935587	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.0774082114963	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.604968839473	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.404972583879	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.249740384279	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.0202941036352	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.891630629167	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.20459362333	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.204499604262	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.437228979484	Well, I did.
0.0	0.239643493659	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.550145255749	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.765084581061	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.208188743357	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.195472764044	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.614631565516	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.546710632016	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.58948742564	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.545119702416	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.557507712639	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.15143557105	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.452455579565	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.342911774741	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.353794104008	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.821969962169	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.233394828165	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.573857152077	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.463963481595	Good at email.
0.0	0.42200561075	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.292474142316	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.293095258007	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.561015384083	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.151696370993	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.481017924389	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.484853489614	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.

0.0	0.447355715191	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.432614482826	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.

0.0	0.406221607072	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.

0.0	0.240098613336	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.384748902823	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.230513567155	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.548945030294	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.278759933719	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.5	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.437064070198	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.432166869891	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.

0.0	0.0274357287206	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.29549605328	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.380550533144	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.754354294006	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.444574857984	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.557877068874	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.

0.0	0.371263539118	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.724599805069	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.258971008229	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.242300016593	We can't do it.
0.0	0.402695152381	It goes away.
0.0	0.372606885235	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.736110455518	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.0741570627466	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.323351294824	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.194658573004	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.

0.0	0.362210310412	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.447188995048	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.332615963475	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.4807777369	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.885856292303	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.09063835887	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.190906589389	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.374996785857	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.2754687456	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.5	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.371747825316	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.28088194535	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.444656780092	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.548401592431	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.484881272124	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.208334650296	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.879638354292	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.540868156927	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.267176928028	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.157399076165	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.343713320478	OK?
0.0	0.209301209701	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.281391659712	It's not working.
0.0	0.20308022162	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.244871303177	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.120451902442	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.340890605433	I will not do that.
0.0	0.480843007904	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.217261762941	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.332367090766	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.353445486019	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.321569535988	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.550630431151	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.5	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.32982723992	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.549641892346	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.613302854109	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.431105802726	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.374153084173	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.211260867545	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.303152952199	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.219045903166	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.573358635991	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.156172185842	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.420800044616	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.462075488418	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.722686134066	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.457921672691	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.840800009956	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.316929129481	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.577123382732	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.403392864763	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.5076670548	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.101572706098	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.165704327902	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.0458934355614	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.123498480635	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.13106290554	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.575601749757	He hit oil.
0.0	0.634130001089	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.319722946689	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.137521384993	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.238865007309	And why?
0.0	0.673466407163	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.645803694477	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.431147617312	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.337327382023	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.443670351487	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.357243449246	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.634292996392	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.148534561631	In all due respect...
0.0	0.519013512268	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.386536947027	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.197398806204	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.481377723477	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.439598856173	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.237751161682	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.444952414652	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.309031936029	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.481773435263	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.357202431501	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.5	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.647813285399	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.457461805701	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
1.0	0.348474142465	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.471254762781	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.171047424162	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
1.0	0.333483405385	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
1.0	0.388446606712	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.423073144023	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.285013195273	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.0691395675534	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.173710389458	That's what we need.
0.0	0.180085096999	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.105103895466	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.418020387596	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.494887652337	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.161522337103	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.219199426792	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.524286960075	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.400323361692	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.167209230661	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.483372255287	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.542798599812	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.37374684387	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.510960485752	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.621316850152	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.743939299001	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.577398396117	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.270616713796	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.322118611309	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.549864857314	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.19517565617	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.406298270531	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.624755812208	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.626662722731	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.631033481516	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.279736634252	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.342814793775	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.56289672048	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.536275786393	That never works.
0.0	0.0739037806409	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.223833518266	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.322608966406	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.145100206148	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.939513711389	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.343068230705	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.186509386137	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.245115175705	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.506981652801	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.849134645603	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.421684638484	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.245220895991	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.871076930948	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.304849227235	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.352014874736	Thank you.
0.0	0.101882866169	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.25622761953	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.352014874736	Thank you.
0.0	0.148359760344	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.552946282532	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.422017332919	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.120107403039	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.0713995515948	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.625864264307	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.622548036138	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.530096824879	That's fine.
0.0	0.36370430847	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.580143868265	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.385379155322	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.509164983041	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
1.0	0.663276655757	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.184005404217	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.100500741619	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.124191846525	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.369990195523	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.25755815168	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.606459100328	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.65666834324	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.512479710271	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.261073322686	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.179582037015	The number of women --
0.0	0.405704052822	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.322635901376	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.434224126771	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.301377885881	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.277224323102	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.413222810978	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.0654310495149	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.823592979315	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
1.0	0.69780724209	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.490007092298	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.43531500188	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.0753740135899	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.378495303602	We're running.
0.0	0.165448585023	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.604877303421	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.19269044944	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.270293651814	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.341835340917	And for good cause.
0.0	0.399826839128	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.514568093418	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.809152869128	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.34978736576	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.47395739694	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.195785060902	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.5	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.256167729398	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.204061167717	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.245420734008	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.800395182045	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.417417697444	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.50530853394	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.40745363397	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.357831692036	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.36437695274	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.539026992584	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.220383885541	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
1.0	0.391288872799	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.153492602639	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.552579185053	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
1.0	0.868121667145	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.674505154066	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.421252047031	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.668690949824	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.585144607115	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.628758630691	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.624859586003	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.360645409292	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.5	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.373371376236	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.608149133065	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.371439044313	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.321969569751	Divide that out.
0.0	0.545950502416	Just for the record.
0.0	0.4926325011	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.416932485123	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.563281900156	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.625701171367	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.393333026436	You're right.
0.0	0.27809812443	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.433058315174	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
1.0	0.71930283154	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.642353515773	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.697728821664	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.548987492455	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.624304748669	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.278236355686	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.375506371698	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.276450659709	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.46893495392	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.263212736727	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.38122262745	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.555891790419	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.159314135737	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.259507666704	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.244661148038	Again...
0.0	0.544891984471	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.265457517638	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.232012124783	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.511239108406	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.214417877428	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.167031005938	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.481087298398	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.355704068361	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.48752659558	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.401900290666	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.404390730959	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.235599503282	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.865550476109	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.4685413414	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.774575932369	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.429285272209	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.25107836186	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.383083975147	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.319509040843	I'll say this.
0.0	0.272410644084	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.433492797041	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.56188709937	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.201873266729	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.661140268012	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.468598201513	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.554051072156	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.534461313811	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.230752250624	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.369738980824	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.461677246208	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
1.0	0.748863356551	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.444818219064	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.225059105402	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.556151590574	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.440631123876	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.711708722621	She voted for it.
0.0	0.392430081955	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.36134170669	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.184849670035	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.308588299047	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.435950207414	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.590348182649	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.52187625239	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.436602950633	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.317695928459	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.470940736105	That's good.
0.0	0.382486425317	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.289737791433	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.360447270163	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.434048247249	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.463106783704	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.25483951952	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.221611886876	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.407852206225	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.681299020897	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.80794446692	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.5	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.429004571005	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.282359358263	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.5280307024	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.446753174718	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.363073934719	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.445902950331	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.14124617973	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.5	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.31206185577	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.418551844014	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.318773181162	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.452676282158	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.767592570783	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.655718190842	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.517151436287	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.562403317236	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.455627099614	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.746830384886	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.264814208142	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.584381832794	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.340434029773	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.202592596635	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.515147000658	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.301604995955	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.5	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.583691726294	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.386598771491	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.259231083289	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.343713320478	Okay.
0.0	0.549183303193	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.570857820339	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.212632253473	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.229343261744	We need sound money.
0.0	0.263991918974	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.527840693094	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.578753769022	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.466181464374	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.133068662701	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.174971107837	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.125659096867	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.70611158334	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.180425651376	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.360482522615	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.406733612045	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.364432033688	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.418208567344	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.417038875568	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.18075239013	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.753514303452	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.531449556565	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.145279837116	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.335804521472	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.382530462309	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.300149479783	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.386316830183	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.144011411413	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.387056992693	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.23921674599	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.450638841142	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.329501831812	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.531906561537	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.575809365066	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.5	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.184234112262	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.22646964989	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.247550839159	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.247484158109	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.202610253273	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.754652917928	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.662937591566	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.439657616615	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.492230225646	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.0651772232308	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.446857887853	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.273409686397	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.269326324715	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.245298824762	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
1.0	0.544846153453	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.462522402569	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.476143878823	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.350860695919	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.343018917625	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.684117184233	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.280282679606	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.509941962366	He is a good man.
0.0	0.383719169642	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.428355867668	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.216591432995	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.131103096486	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.192919476051	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.438114344831	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.441594697978	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.345446547399	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.405179768795	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.61139475645	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.298485558667	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
1.0	0.963701502415	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.255270518197	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
1.0	0.900667188881	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.727537490407	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.473192922405	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.525884152707	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.0232901974896	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.375123070313	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.406193041536	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.449148503195	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.482293719418	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.587733810306	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.27358541385	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.281937625459	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.417175212597	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.460366958951	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.649691615597	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.605530845951	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.5	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.234820574218	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.43451270339	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.3439201855	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.223431211488	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.454636804373	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.407470160246	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.292333504683	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.552011495004	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.666324852769	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.450193129897	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.369361179833	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.268842585632	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.637398815567	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.269765825515	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.251073048551	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.525477250606	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.338236315181	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.623654893067	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.473849325695	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.32911601154	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.345663868535	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.704750042192	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.315912837845	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.5	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.198747747705	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.318696743204	That has not been...
0.0	0.341704364511	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.205615910333	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.447393730122	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.47809426226	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.45308148358	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.360261641117	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.457747791825	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.261484894042	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.176148070104	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.267643743794	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.661738352263	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.171798043322	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.494615704272	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.335360772898	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.221944056345	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.481260610372	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.273761646579	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.706312618751	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.375616248042	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.330611945329	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.239932325501	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.225181717349	No -- no...
0.0	0.563004378775	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.337102209268	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.369216196852	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.24695188026	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.301735547613	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.52551150115	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.371840799144	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.416762209357	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.386172568593	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.746953005253	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.373049414001	I don't care.
0.0	0.208203070187	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
1.0	0.227771643447	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.551188482983	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.529039267342	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.21932353981	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.236278548517	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.215690039202	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.213700769664	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.645762163973	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.725704105995	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.5	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.487092596717	A brief response.
0.0	0.655496001347	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.441182144845	We have to be honest about it.
