0.0	0.36042308174	It's one of the key investments we need to make.
0.0	0.115605818808	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.250095482685	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.2881958984	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.26739179386	From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made.
0.0	0.329665856218	That means education.

0.0	0.237391637302	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.438543642797	And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans.
0.0	0.47797214306	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.00894659045934	No, you weren't.
0.0	0.361225348384	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.23190271399	We offered a lot more.
0.0	0.5	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.560315811075	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.

0.0	0.271548346002	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.0988716882625	I'm ready.

0.0	0.190850908372	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.225357464446	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.489057677694	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.289677044178	But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
0.0	0.125886518509	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.560163094103	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.643795835389	That's what I said to my own public health people.
0.0	0.508915481639	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.701867433372	And then on top of that, we've got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are pouring huge sums of money into super PACS heavily influencing the political process.
0.0	0.253396492843	(inaudible).
0.0	0.142973995366	I'd suggest people take a look at it.
0.0	0.1194454529	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.

0.0	0.337376873432	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.10650227605	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.135032990696	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.0290687243956	And there's a lot.
0.0	0.454624642766	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.5	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.632907282012	In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.
0.0	0.599158158227	So that it will not be a federal crime.
0.0	0.0101905027662	I love the Saudis.
0.0	0.241945745493	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
0.0	0.186015569611	Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.208726094785	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.198497950978	We don't have victories anymore.
0.0	0.338078274223	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.222711714342	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.54260831869	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.30888299093	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.103007885848	We saw what happened in Egypt.
0.0	0.0831148626495	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.0545071428424	That's what I'm working towards.
1.0	0.662705766619	The truth of the matter is, net immigration from Mexico last year was zero.
0.0	0.19923842491	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.12849777006	I know how hard it is to build coalitions.
1.0	0.966780698308	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.0517960093561	Excuse me.
0.0	0.819852064241	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.83439785286	It's their money.
0.0	0.528529549799	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.446915874244	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.439807485538	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.225095122263	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.173284466649	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.856785054219	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.0900244872426	I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...
0.0	0.354069690215	I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
0.0	0.219082883395	He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing?
1.0	0.0703292451354	Don't believe the 5.6.
0.0	0.102729590159	Absolutely.
0.0	0.241406219978	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.
0.0	0.37856894057	She wants to pursue the American dream.
0.0	0.101933695247	We were wrong.
0.0	0.0705527054102	Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.
1.0	0.372702722911	We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
0.0	0.23667187613	That never works.
0.0	0.0936515969472	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.133258500291	We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America.
0.0	0.060115885726	Let me just -- let me just...
0.0	0.337887571962	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.266722145178	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.285284289513	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.154975493493	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.346075331824	My son is not a pair of boots on the ground.
0.0	0.0676042700201	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.178852912379	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.111607681573	That is absolutely not right.
1.0	0.880338275263	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.347445219486	I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.
0.0	0.250885666642	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.488083293614	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.220499280825	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.114251023691	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.0861615143778	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.4255392929	Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
0.0	0.212599476144	That's when we become Greece.
0.0	0.270620583529	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.0867928830732	We're ready to start shooting."
0.0	0.589491710031	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.178061443362	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.183355143914	We do.
0.0	0.183355143914	It was...
0.0	0.959629384306	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.0345123096469	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.684203896869	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.214753707795	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.131179032587	Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president.
0.0	0.141032431823	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.0888717637029	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.411619244897	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.409656082728	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.331291977118	So Ford will come back.
1.0	0.979517852657	Very few children.
0.0	0.426203611036	And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians, who are also flying in that space.
0.0	0.0681220806831	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.184273266427	You know, we had this incident before, Secretary, with your famous e-mails.
0.0	0.15963567775	And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.
0.0	0.346023077498	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.0466029607664	They have no choice.
0.0	0.450610939453	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.194422863237	I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history.
0.0	0.282892890216	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.089421530633	That would be a disaster for this country.
0.0	0.123197453462	David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave.
0.0	0.163045280802	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.131046159318	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.852431397464	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.97462855556	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.512442346438	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.733838464162	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.0298030183317	He was young.
0.0	0.449325083941	People were just being fined to death.
0.0	0.192230648289	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.28960738409	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.
1.0	0.336760918692	Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees -- these are big vehicles -- were left behind for the enemy.
0.0	0.139290394366	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
0.0	0.160600911519	Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.
0.0	0.377522813897	Go on to my website.
0.0	0.417384203549	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.311281110895	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.211520989879	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.0392180171768	That is not right.
0.0	0.206650709965	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.284090873897	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.262334283367	But Obamacare kicks in in 2016.
0.0	0.540454028783	Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military.
0.0	0.117933326632	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.529903518423	This ties into campaign finance reform.
0.0	0.746355490391	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.0468214370447	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.0104735820598	So be very, very careful.
0.0	0.098274799838	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.613621896832	... that's the -- that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration.
0.0	0.110220070162	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.347951624347	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.0985173292391	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.158003310887	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.170964193241	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
0.0	0.145990637043	You can do both.
0.0	0.223124145907	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.47332191847	And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues.
0.0	0.849554812242	You should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition.
0.0	0.970109008455	They make a billion dollars a day.
0.0	0.367921950831	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.210597232731	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.253667669349	You read about all the companies now that are doing business -- about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on.
0.0	0.0828381711801	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.088086266951	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.489352045943	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.054625378784	Jeb, please attack Ted..."
1.0	0.346609096745	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.638530091779	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.437856128144	They started in Iowa.
0.0	0.62186214318	I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.
0.0	0.143001458529	Now, here's what is going to happen.
1.0	0.262017640831	He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage, and what its effects are.
0.0	0.42512850556	Their business model is greed and fraud.
0.0	0.249386311981	John, the world is a very dangerous place, but the world is not too dangerous of a place for the United States of America, provided we act according to our principles, provided we act intelligently.
0.0	0.393653208681	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.0874993082751	I'm going to be independent.
0.0	0.462314156743	Well, I'm kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time.
0.0	0.231924371982	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.256801967508	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.290149066832	So let's move toward what we should be doing as a nation and follow the values of our immigration history and begin to make it possible for them to come out of the shadows and to have a future that gives them a full chance of citizenship.
0.0	0.722875637891	For example, it is outrageous that we don't have an opportunity for Medicare to negotiate for lower prices.
0.0	0.289741687747	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.17327801785	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.682642864314	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.168680115533	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.131550091665	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.42941378843	And it has been amazing to me.
0.0	0.853718096495	... saying, no middle class tax raises.
0.0	0.413307073079	Yes, and it was the same one that President Obama made.
0.0	0.0339626904508	You're certainly not very good.
0.0	0.322795128801	Wall Street is a threat to the economy.
0.0	0.0336621438332	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.121172193393	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.338720399148	Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid.
0.0	0.756842943632	It was an investment bank.
0.0	0.127716161943	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.234942268381	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.168314742512	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.699334782918	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.935462983334	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.332817990005	Can I share this quick story?
0.0	0.323138896715	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.144984661636	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.103680482879	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.782622339527	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
0.0	0.110229303888	... (inaudible) opening statement.
0.0	0.258492584617	As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election.
0.0	0.603660534913	But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.
0.0	0.441922737618	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.217586170425	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.
0.0	0.212775611901	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.363836368281	Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer.
0.0	0.390137031869	I spent a lot of time in the situation room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us.
0.0	0.0319175365015	He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots.
0.0	0.380269172867	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.13560644286	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.408610572643	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.101625014857	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.10410987194	...Chris...
0.0	0.208980761211	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.133312020102	But people have to be alert.
0.0	0.361703001249	Yes, this one falls under the category of, I have actually done this.
0.0	0.368877620903	We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.
0.0	0.617931053538	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.103706763736	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.213432457253	But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.
0.0	0.167520412898	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.135578927923	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.309270621455	RADDATZ: OK. Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, right here at Saint Anselm college, Neil Levesque.
0.0	0.472736157856	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.360416514712	If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
0.0	0.225642192488	Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond...
0.0	0.168961513898	You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.
0.0	0.154827518046	Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.
0.0	0.0233392701944	I agree completely.
0.0	0.131282222392	I would not want to go to that point.
0.0	0.184915101873	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.0392180171768	That's right.
0.0	0.133347698867	It's coming from more than Mexico.
0.0	0.229328944792	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.442173694646	Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin.
0.0	0.264151100183	When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war.
0.0	0.0940660902109	I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.
0.0	0.225252200514	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.249758682561	And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.
0.0	0.645232205529	It wasn't the bill that I wanted, but yet it turned out to be one of the more significant pieces of veterans' legislation passed in recent history.
0.0	0.0671685402252	Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.
0.0	0.0207203473709	See?
0.0	0.215429734973	But it cannot be an American fight.
0.0	0.789775794088	I'm one of the 77 percent.
0.0	0.176401512834	My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.
0.0	0.180305787825	We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.
0.0	0.63180117454	... and we will end the illegal immigration.
1.0	0.957007849465	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
0.0	0.147636264537	That was a terrible mistake.
0.0	0.399689810374	And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation.
0.0	0.446413306743	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.106326220089	In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
0.0	0.347369673598	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.122822146725	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.465250341738	I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.
0.0	0.125670109535	And I hear their speeches.
0.0	0.539578226713	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.17129793385	Yes, they control them.
0.0	0.363746493544	And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and I would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go.
0.0	0.799203583758	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.112693436799	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.118464355623	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.202628372483	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
1.0	0.921506987705	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.470540984305	I introduced...
0.0	0.107543113902	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.0850868329398	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.130352701346	We got it.
0.0	0.213274130554	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.246785694607	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.18344933942	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.
0.0	0.204413286624	And we also need a cheerleader.
0.0	0.275331758979	But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.111125780918	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.204222259227	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.428169541282	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.225558345301	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.925593445147	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.334561543961	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.125205597839	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
0.0	0.0316543469964	I think you're --
0.0	0.677710327431	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.263940123691	We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
0.0	0.69881076887	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.479396946829	More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows.
0.0	0.0559735301877	They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists.
0.0	0.999999027693	$24 trillion.
0.0	0.837560786762	Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions?
0.0	0.107360246778	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.198257560796	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.389751034513	And people are saying, "What's going on?

0.0	0.33821149352	What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.
0.0	0.106284413941	Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple.
0.0	0.317996835464	And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence.

0.0	0.232141266223	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.0441892615677	I think he'd be a great spirit."
0.0	0.392940908727	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.285893192899	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.

0.0	0.265390848028	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.294852952305	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.272247330027	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
0.0	0.570203075747	And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.

0.0	0.0275286416115	That's my view.

0.0	0.102143744413	Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.
0.0	0.673664310655	And, unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage, I actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.132877702068	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.585622011797	And we've got to do more on equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.0168500009093	We can't do it.
0.0	0.909435034927	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.707786515335	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.129605878526	That will change everything.
0.0	0.26781345909	Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.

0.0	0.0864019503608	They will be our early warning signal.
0.0	0.804382625054	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.895944206033	It is not because of the tax writeoff.
0.0	0.477939895102	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.105251133021	I heard what they said.
0.0	0.376200766539	And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country.
0.0	0.42866257956	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.053000142034	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.685931510393	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.129859160956	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.381689783865	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.287142145642	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.476505913497	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.821737339486	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.0719316352798	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.382806708684	So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
0.0	0.10410987194	Chris?
0.0	0.060222382324	We need a collaborative approach.
0.0	0.265696200911	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.166558066053	John, may I -- may I interject here?
0.0	0.264286005316	And here's the problem in this country right now.
0.0	0.0674053155375	I'm proud of my family.
0.0	0.19188126431	On January 20th, 2017, the next president of the United States will walk into the White House.
0.0	0.396597793938	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.911049687757	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.53499228474	So I said, "That's OK." I'm proud of my net worth.
0.0	0.121394831527	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.473101571354	It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.
0.0	0.266892280337	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.0939146335726	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.339488200836	It's interesting that Jeb mentions the book.
0.0	0.577867560978	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.0789368115987	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.731947963649	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.22282971951	And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country.
0.0	0.0637747050352	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.202127779219	If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.
0.0	0.216080696458	But many, many people did.
1.0	0.956076747197	We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.
0.0	0.360270717725	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.0498620224147	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.0375974107427	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.153382191957	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.220706175295	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.338273609353	Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region.
0.0	0.951694027381	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.0517646097975	But you know what else they're anxious about?
0.0	0.167712790152	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
0.0	0.356618298678	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
1.0	0.0790620601142	He's not wall street.
0.0	0.430584980921	It had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.0355906508674	That's what we need.
0.0	0.0355215433467	See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together.
0.0	0.737920278191	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.38159950434	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.221146989748	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.5	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.521200927704	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.901470454999	He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration.
0.0	0.449504616668	They're controlled fully -- they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
0.0	0.610321588329	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.78601620783	Why is it that we are spending per capita far, far more than Canada, which is 100 miles away from my door, that guarantees health care to all people?
0.0	0.670967861545	And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.
0.0	0.178799017271	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.349448757848	And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.
0.0	0.676949992354	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.190467466902	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.681011402353	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.226136831806	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.742623973446	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.508276317335	And so, look, the way that -- a stronger middle class is actually the source of economic growth.
0.0	0.306376363491	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.164427880931	And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.671768889918	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.137564669984	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.162212129667	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.472187606831	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.460938588768	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.191561772073	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.205201577573	Let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.122517080199	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.352120031404	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.729508215882	We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.
1.0	0.873103135773	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.179524572074	Ted can change his mind.
0.0	0.385187301245	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.245573186967	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
1.0	0.914167711857	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
0.0	0.159130678574	It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.136805703472	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.

0.0	0.513133181189	In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America.
0.0	0.169029453327	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.168156351569	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.0899487730701	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.282605563981	We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.
0.0	0.263220908945	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.436748887193	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.210842379803	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.157356768096	I didn't say permanently.

0.0	0.15786310102	Martha, may I -- Martha, may I...
0.0	0.256424157567	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
0.0	0.465520241708	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.162959926447	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.430309865305	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.0422166279281	I think it's a two-pronged issue.
0.0	0.105970284898	They were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.061683430918	The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering, these are not the perpetrators.
0.0	0.199339555179	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.
0.0	0.012218610081	I'll do it.
0.0	0.141661879631	Thank you, John.

0.0	0.530650674988	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.346954464505	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.0719256297826	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.202233868642	They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.
0.0	0.138585638771	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.106216263973	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.

0.0	0.060115885726	Let me just...
0.0	0.183355143914	Why?
0.0	0.0736981700313	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.136887258728	... Chris, keep it coming...
0.0	0.439088705108	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.0655377259812	And you know what?
0.0	0.0871599785565	You're right.
0.0	0.17208219551	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.

0.0	0.0586282754063	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.073079674068	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.183355143914	But Megyn...
0.0	0.231149751068	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.308301747665	We also have to build a coalition at home.
0.0	0.0602386695609	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.201430031482	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.538683511719	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.0392180171768	Right.
0.0	0.1830331483	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.114858031513	It's a joke.
0.0	0.288504391516	And I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate.
0.0	0.183321015274	Yes.
0.0	0.316272624837	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.534801103082	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.221826621342	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.269408217465	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.277702930706	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.119787658656	I totally get that.
0.0	0.158411973645	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.0759097955574	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.710418448234	I also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees.
0.0	0.302632833495	I believe that the goal should be debt-free college.
0.0	0.683989840123	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.229703090399	I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis.
0.0	0.447180304214	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.206822049511	But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says.
0.0	0.365313581684	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
0.0	0.580066473424	Get rid of the fraud.
0.0	0.122063272268	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.190432313677	They have children who are doing so well, I've met and worked with dreamers.
0.0	0.69160156053	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
1.0	0.532130071674	They're bringing drugs.
0.0	0.260085540786	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
0.0	0.490842725726	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.340839601595	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.181417714831	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.235591713416	When you come back to me, I'll share that story.
0.0	0.348883092821	It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested.
0.0	0.309070665431	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.22443111845	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.197672887381	We need to end minimal sentencing.
0.0	0.248070963568	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.113079748562	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.270096484787	Here's my promise-- Wall Street representatives will not be in my cabinet.
0.0	0.966871257807	Could we loan you $4 billion"?
0.0	0.016777823958	Think about that.
0.0	0.157721351615	We saw a Muslim brotherhood president installed, and then we saw him ousted and the army back.
0.0	0.400378853732	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.
0.0	0.147466372503	Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.

0.0	0.825667822084	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.236883955313	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.329271827563	I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.
0.0	0.137869035502	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.
0.0	0.240804491091	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.419169756755	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.242705712182	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.657339417834	And if our middle class makes more money, they spend more money, and our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.0286132229307	I like it.
0.0	0.00894659045934	Don't do it."
0.0	0.0992673461765	I've done it.
0.0	0.30134282361	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.139767518638	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.297539978124	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.68419347662	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.356563020013	Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
0.0	0.0703712875971	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.18926705756	There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better.
0.0	0.183355143914	These...
1.0	0.963228130956	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.467982236526	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.270944399665	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.410800910447	I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here.
0.0	0.596898895734	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.299664665992	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.
1.0	0.904569736731	She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.
0.0	0.537477656279	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.327945636603	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.123257288543	So nice, thank you very much.
0.0	0.385726020359	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.0204000229366	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.19016594261	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.164400835423	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.0829659909084	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.409125111119	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.321344102425	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.102393471278	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.629809503553	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.17594601425	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.117823712954	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.452215089642	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.0286132229307	I like that.

0.0	0.60283270847	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.359104010874	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.0770130650348	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.

0.0	0.0517960093561	Excuse me.
0.0	0.508299381042	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.

0.0	0.277315955862	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.651618193929	I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone.
0.0	0.134071796392	Martha -- I would just repeat that --
0.0	0.11783191984	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.592884965061	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.119529815207	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.0630133620658	But I would add this.
0.0	0.0943372748848	I'd like to offer a...
0.0	0.175719697485	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.376667929029	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.450035397015	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.422766431962	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.176236960478	Whoever heard of this?
1.0	0.985348697204	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.235053919564	But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.
0.0	0.4093954083	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
0.0	0.601040987173	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.192904840844	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.46197011943	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.172521069945	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.263362909287	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.474570651345	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.363612223946	I promise.
0.0	0.451034815459	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.126923612032	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.389349213534	We need to do it now as a nation.
0.0	0.0986854609369	It is a tragedy all over this country.
0.0	0.0652692635792	But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.
0.0	0.303529172925	And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.
0.0	0.659552007381	And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.
0.0	0.476450473354	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.22657386838	It will give hope to millions of young people.
0.0	0.289908153087	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.254017625767	And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.
0.0	0.0438419722081	He's not arming the Kurds.
0.0	0.786303297453	Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.
0.0	0.521652430177	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.305853490293	If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W. Bush made after 9/11 when he basically said after going to a Mosque in Washington, we are not at war with Islam or Muslims.
0.0	0.00249295632677	But look...
0.0	0.252711653474	And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college.
0.0	0.0986809763397	David, let me give you a little bit of background here.
0.0	0.249460855807	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.517024461656	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.0165634380459	We are not France.
0.0	0.172295094899	Libya is now a mess.

0.0	0.033579690318	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.122412421674	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.147674124742	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.536883451283	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.
0.0	0.641934094444	But Secretary Clinton is wrong.
0.0	0.230169988531	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.145001126363	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.0995936954586	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.175839442614	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.5	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.490553435177	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.0286132229307	I like them.
0.0	0.353311622511	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.0517960093561	Excuse me, no.
0.0	0.050330943429	I like how you stand up.
0.0	0.355337786194	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.810131713221	Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.
0.0	0.54543007782	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.488470395649	This is what's made our nation so special.
0.0	0.671086040518	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.152272988388	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.0789250761251	I think I am a nice person.
0.0	0.197584073975	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.515679841544	Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
0.0	0.579399819314	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.58807191789	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.0753337513069	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.435064919281	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.200174708698	All of that together, we're going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.
0.0	0.301642442147	I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.
0.0	0.203877581982	He is not the only one.
1.0	0.995317005484	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
0.0	0.591054724484	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.459533166388	They are anxious on a number of levels.
0.0	0.743264716989	It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military.

0.0	0.0931041837745	They don't even have a chance.
0.0	0.25748524415	First priority, destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.0933914537716	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.665789832608	We have a corrupt campaign finance system dominated by Super PACs.
0.0	0.0999321017078	It's very important we operate on both at the same time.
0.0	0.135529294224	But I think it's the right road for us to try to travel.
0.0	0.0818151782031	Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done.
0.0	0.236420792373	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.
0.0	0.310138065356	I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up.
0.0	0.209542845219	Well, you know, governor, I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010.
0.0	0.245841674644	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.18326345941	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.183355143914	How?
0.0	0.136020449787	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.

0.0	0.358663131071	It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them.
0.0	0.196512539554	Well, I got it for two reasons.
0.0	0.250886123617	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.585456353316	One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines.

0.0	0.11094358158	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
0.0	0.443283628617	I'm not using the lobbyists.
0.0	0.0551538218608	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.836428235828	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.463484176692	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.136375771773	Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.
0.0	0.274402085287	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.128731879678	Well, thank you, John.
0.0	0.212765368753	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
0.0	0.0647957192481	There's give and take.
0.0	0.760273609005	I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains.
0.0	0.110332219984	Wait a minute.
0.0	0.110591520172	We have losers.
0.0	0.510099659049	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.0718090180646	Well, I did.
0.0	0.0787045665623	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.224829502281	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.104325158547	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.331389704876	So, in terms of refugees, I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe, with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that, of course, we reach out.
0.0	0.1834174088	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.358188315794	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.763039974267	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.410907253333	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.24619110459	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
1.0	0.999998734787	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.32870254187	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.352375030394	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.302822762783	And here's what the economic issue is.
1.0	0.956055906276	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.451624868891	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.188933752941	And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.
0.0	0.222054658786	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.477708860903	They should be Muslim troops.
0.0	0.414092754897	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.0582119741807	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.179593632099	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.781637510458	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
0.0	0.900237232349	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
1.0	0.980940996084	Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.
0.0	0.102854571745	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
0.0	0.195008094288	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.544316850008	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.304036269263	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.163155926304	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.277675175885	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.622176716601	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.0746201639623	We need -- we need somebody -- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.
0.0	0.148679871608	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.0542905302948	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.403345679031	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.425405662631	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.41914650413	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.121966212178	Yes -- thank you.
1.0	0.882262425321	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.233656999591	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.183355143914	It is.
0.0	0.366414830035	Well, we're going to have to redo the way the prescription drug industry does business.
0.0	0.314722468172	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.0313168572073	Wait for what?
0.0	0.251317699776	We have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as General Dempsey said.
0.0	0.232153505708	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.412305213358	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.0144041697821	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.0937141731766	Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.249594932839	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.195269532173	We now finally are where we need to be.
0.0	0.384156026785	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.638513046638	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.407337892308	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.351185485568	The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign.
0.0	0.619747870489	But unlike either of these two fine people, I've actually balanced a budget every single year.
0.0	0.407812596371	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.397053929644	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.115783521088	Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.
0.0	0.470642280552	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.672765006801	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.384120493921	That's the secondary issue.
0.0	0.435742737447	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.139858989617	It's nice.
0.0	0.862582864501	I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil.
0.0	0.0566211043397	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.904383424716	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.13540493495	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
0.0	0.208261854372	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.356244072447	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.568386600488	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.422801318855	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.126886466227	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.39384941533	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.124504682354	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.0655224309577	We don't win.
0.0	0.0617753813169	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
1.0	0.999991440685	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.0703292451354	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.43279227263	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.555029766779	And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.0335198080909	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.528763368911	I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.
0.0	0.101269304539	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.247904304347	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.0609631453522	We must anticipate these threats before they happen.
0.0	0.183355143914	No their not.
0.0	0.493527028499	And now they are beating us economically.
0.0	0.1497796852	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.129958368133	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.806924307249	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.647022642031	We need, basically, to pledge that we're going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.
0.0	0.763828047879	So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again.
0.0	0.153850324119	So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe.
0.0	0.0963817582906	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.439226541175	(APPLAUSE) They're trying to prevent people from registering to vote.
0.0	0.062056923276	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.216741209148	As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.181218214781	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.48774351992	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.221131125869	Let's do more -- let's do more than reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.172121398202	That is why we need to make police -- and I speak as a former mayor.
0.0	0.245540932321	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.129752772603	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.15997632308	I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries.
0.0	0.39979493867	And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina, and many other Republican states, that because of their right wing political ideology, are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.100627973597	Can you believe this?
0.0	0.291198044529	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.0841012760738	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.138033461052	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.211400695516	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.
0.0	0.688956050686	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.177315622558	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
0.0	0.183355143914	So what do we do?
0.0	0.1627626786	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.612666741033	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.479466246474	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
1.0	0.548252828056	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.0557371381559	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.166301482617	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.393947018737	So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.
0.0	0.307688709003	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.886669753668	Number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own.
0.0	0.19344150029	Yeah (ph), no, I think that's a -- that's a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques.
0.0	0.621030460881	Kathie, that is the kind of economy I believe, put money in the hands of working people, raise the minimum wage to 15 buck an hour.
0.0	0.137832622398	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.183377273449	Say again?
0.0	0.183850777489	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.938916808457	But -- but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages.
0.0	0.120491559153	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.593881003893	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
0.0	0.50780493176	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.27478319802	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.408059184522	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.19593112123	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.116933162787	You have a bigger problem with China.
0.0	0.417990786522	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.125808034368	And I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern.
0.0	0.309435019547	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.5	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.106909443124	This is a terribly complicated issue.
0.0	0.423425408634	I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.
0.0	0.392085136502	I never said that.
0.0	0.150411885168	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.236858663253	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.152743475291	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.221747869305	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.722247741207	Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.
1.0	0.926033234079	He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.
0.0	0.0693560557603	You don't hear it from anybody else.
0.0	0.184176772201	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.0385774983846	It feels different.
0.0	0.0974675023148	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.363751462895	But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn't cut and run.
0.0	0.183355143914	No -- no...
0.0	0.760241953045	Seventeen more million more people have health care.
0.0	0.0825125009363	So it was not against ISIS, it was against -- it was against Assad.
0.0	0.1834174088	Thank you very, very much.
0.0	0.183355143914	But what...
0.0	0.220311898505	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.284191070219	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.0644034856096	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.215490769117	They like to ask direct questions.
0.0	0.306082195906	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.547193752894	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.570118939717	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
1.0	0.790038066131	Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion.
1.0	0.80886105499	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.907233291913	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.242153015998	That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.
0.0	0.124345894685	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.
0.0	0.971313639634	So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion.
0.0	0.377473896003	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.449510382046	She led that effort.
0.0	0.897213234368	And universities.
0.0	0.567549218748	So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating, but the highest median income in America.
0.0	0.230725797463	Like we have a -- we have a lot of work to do and we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do.
0.0	0.95733488098	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...

0.0	0.159231460098	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.459195537044	So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years -- you know, we're at $8 trillion now.
0.0	0.142016465287	Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem.
0.0	0.415981646498	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.0254304622943	It won't happen.
0.0	0.151494727001	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.

0.0	0.620399730468	What part is valid?
0.0	0.0280247719517	OK...
0.0	0.208018644628	I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs.
0.0	0.470333932623	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.5	They are not doing it now.
0.0	0.460050827926	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.964224612834	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.133020069418	... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message.
0.0	0.24014801426	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.346309192315	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
1.0	0.0962431402498	Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.
0.0	0.579641491052	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.151947938019	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.170180289119	Well, we did have a plan, and I think it's fair to say that of all of the Arab leaders, Gaddafi probably had more blood on his hands of Americans than anybody else.
0.0	0.938572009722	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.552303192016	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
0.0	0.218419792305	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.484337640194	So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.

0.0	0.115963984851	Media notwithstanding.
0.0	0.914153607721	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.081950097586	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.539341271133	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.233919617473	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.697837475861	We have to do away with the strawman proposal.
0.0	0.124363464579	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.242539027366	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.0985086435173	I was there and I saw the debate.
0.0	0.0705409974527	But she did say there was anger.
1.0	0.994159390235	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.265043066357	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.

0.0	0.204601330585	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.0927490188351	We have nothing.
0.0	0.176745454057	That's what I said.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.317550108138	I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.
0.0	0.31248638634	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.318627418972	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.733006592397	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.481084277046	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.305299310118	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.465860680212	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.167546504816	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.296545563601	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.153840914279	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.653464785607	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.350210681703	And in 19 -- and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said -- and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever.
0.0	0.0256962085519	But I learned a lot.
0.0	0.161546433438	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.143869960192	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
0.0	0.264585020547	Why do -- why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major -- the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?
0.0	0.0498069138205	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.681532792143	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.442599288898	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.184606773762	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.157008235069	They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it."
0.0	0.098772687502	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.232620294474	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.138468585019	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.674739478526	He's actually a negative force.
0.0	0.163782089641	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.168190565502	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.985454941638	$1 billion a day.
0.0	0.654092191598	The Obama administration.
0.0	0.291965814793	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.243145668495	Quite likely, for that reason.
0.0	0.22535332327	Enough said.
0.0	0.236975940461	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.0468372560863	That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
0.0	0.24620735322	The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
0.0	0.815591691618	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.392500938025	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.422332779588	It all will be scrutinized.
0.0	0.220808796522	I am advocating...
0.0	0.82662891583	We can end welfare for those here illegally.
0.0	0.672236687938	Just for the record.
0.0	0.853639974369	And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.
0.0	0.0548528746137	That's what the political revolution is about.
0.0	0.0529269441579	I think we're missing the point here.
0.0	0.235800406067	You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now -- it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run.
0.0	0.0796097328803	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.375765860887	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.
0.0	0.130092959569	So was I, John.
0.0	0.320017025514	If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out.
0.0	0.548810991592	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.241040735554	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.115710345737	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.108685960942	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.257101873654	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.026973073992	They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.
1.0	0.0735824682054	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.644197761579	The number of women --
0.0	0.173619463297	We're running.
0.0	0.0818669708894	Let's be frank here.
0.0	0.469703177918	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.238469629565	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.308998547713	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.159725414024	We know about the Brits.
0.0	0.377446569086	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.434207034625	Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military.
0.0	0.225525663545	It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.
0.0	0.201123039962	We now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act, and I don't think we should have to be defending it among Democrats.
0.0	0.191003495852	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.363908245284	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.730442128522	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.229041174089	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.201239757076	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
1.0	0.34826671755	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.56321103539	I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons.
0.0	0.622933048296	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.184131961292	Just get me a job.
0.0	0.171131772162	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.0575294319705	Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.
0.0	0.0842137583657	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.0164807630366	Divide that out.
0.0	0.215065910227	Now, our country needs -- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
0.0	0.00685922341456	It's what they call it.
0.0	0.266279448113	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.430309865305	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.198176627012	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.176962441917	The Iranians getting more of a presence in Syria, linking with Hezbollah, their proxy in Lebanon, would threaten Israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with Assad's future.
0.0	0.199361279367	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.57969399685	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.159209859373	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.0900707096177	It is not tough talk.
0.0	0.0699455643908	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.142782046529	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.510342203356	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.263030924353	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.591220640541	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.446881053059	I want immigration reform to pass.
0.0	0.07426082357	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.141762717502	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.971142941032	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.137141422468	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.290877131717	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.183355143914	...
0.0	0.530324540392	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.088921951988	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
1.0	0.904026009213	The Republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times.
0.0	0.167038464733	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
1.0	0.856829166249	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
1.0	0.420892041515	In 1988, I lost an election because I said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of America.
0.0	0.117818712289	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
1.0	0.993265693143	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.0589805687138	And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen.
1.0	0.8365157066	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.337983332255	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.473882156215	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.0762133017792	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.444856591367	We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party.
1.0	0.989228176459	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.350975620586	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.424714893577	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.311408613973	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
0.0	0.114079341606	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.0950901058823	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.306512403198	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.0210200117568	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.550658486117	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.773108602353	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.386665416746	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
1.0	0.879158644985	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.175284048207	We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.
0.0	0.43740663894	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
0.0	0.11794038839	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.0245602960573	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.210439985369	That means everything.
0.0	0.160418286044	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.
0.0	0.112407078899	It never happens.
0.0	0.23179596542	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.630754062704	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.298630949549	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.368200415328	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.323122494958	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.202658142503	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.518439480559	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.0613361686076	I have to tell you.
0.0	0.359669912083	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.5	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.158726971222	You count on it.
0.0	0.227407523299	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.109230964514	And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are.
0.0	0.845467441839	My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.071911341621	Where did that spirit come from in America?
1.0	0.843150104451	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.121828821995	Well, I've got news for you, we can.
0.0	0.114473672473	I'll say this.
0.0	0.151219743686	I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States and literally around the world that there is a "clash of civilizations," that there is some kind of Western plot or even "war against Islam," which then I believe fans the flames of radicalization.

0.0	0.0696744650199	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.591058589852	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
1.0	0.999999834228	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.
0.0	0.130352701346	I got that.
0.0	0.0972157752363	It ain't complicated.
0.0	0.125077977541	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.142448696584	I said, "I gotta go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.272841262424	It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state.
0.0	0.335303671277	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.244836599869	Making fun of disabled people...
0.0	0.359774629424	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.139467706241	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.816267701933	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.586713281833	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.122360270466	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.66133270344	But the poll numbers have.

0.0	0.373403050424	Our country is in serious trouble.
0.0	0.313304436516	Obama is going to be out playing golf.
0.0	0.237647650428	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.200315773223	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.0443359225666	We did our own rallies.
0.0	0.290347185064	We actually did it.
0.0	0.183355143914	No.
0.0	0.478189107268	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.231003193113	I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
1.0	0.991177758334	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.115547978903	But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college.
0.0	0.521356862126	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.0409949587653	How great is that?
0.0	0.0671382107588	I would change them.
0.0	0.14052924689	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.225982039731	One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this, is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations.
1.0	0.99999950044	The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation.
0.0	0.750600861923	They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
0.0	0.282453688408	So, yes, I did know people.
0.0	0.19344878137	That can be done without profiling people.
0.0	0.0655687169582	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.199212738002	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.378481466023	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.47443722216	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.157687667199	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.425715196611	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.434364579161	We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
0.0	0.343474734565	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.541901303988	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.790263270685	But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
0.0	0.272127945744	In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...
0.0	0.155107531127	Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging.
0.0	0.420280601441	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
1.0	0.64025897241	You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small.
0.0	0.152293228201	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.112011268392	I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.
0.0	0.087047718323	That's what we believe in.
0.0	0.352825692776	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.20125999946	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.183321015274	Yes.
0.0	0.900222238217	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.28602826606	And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, "if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed.
0.0	0.884066868402	And that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums.
0.0	0.277334707977	We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States.
0.0	0.409479588684	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.296154238827	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.242174954385	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.141246702479	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.267193653422	Those are all really positive developments.
0.0	0.105246361949	I'm all about making sure we actually get results for whatever we do.
0.0	0.256277101596	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.492259229401	And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty.
0.0	0.129112274056	I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.
0.0	0.338269826636	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.932685879025	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.520386144502	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.141488781946	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.33890389776	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.335805775818	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.68665159091	People have been paying it for years.
0.0	0.313444671758	And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.
0.0	0.559802265398	That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.465223410511	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.494638718137	We now have a gun on every table.
0.0	0.173981480708	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
0.0	0.135433562052	We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
0.0	0.173893268524	Please go to hillaryclinton.com and be part of making this country what we know it can and should be.
0.0	0.394992943071	And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.
0.0	0.430808488204	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.443275636833	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.553436085698	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.398080585056	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.478558750424	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.138224309872	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.
0.0	0.0443359850239	Am I supposed to dislike them?
0.0	0.472071964364	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.55555581424	Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care.
0.0	0.26281559302	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
0.0	0.520332275644	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.132628637733	I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen.
0.0	0.849083977831	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
1.0	0.953532896452	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.183470701082	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.24293724663	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.25456797329	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.203134666235	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.113165727714	They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.
0.0	0.154282223861	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.263091435534	Is creating much deeper, closer relations and, yes, coalitions within our own country.
0.0	0.289348298342	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.113992896938	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
0.0	0.472564502614	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.218869294893	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.188931431854	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.164106480447	Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.
0.0	0.137780313773	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.116258946649	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.647908574157	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.300632014558	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.742093810305	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.132490120554	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.414961085175	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.448685838615	You have all of these disastrous airports.
0.0	0.186057969142	I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
0.0	0.396468506392	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.347649705895	I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.
0.0	0.0624855903418	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.0952775646701	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.361948809007	They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.
0.0	0.68724735055	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.175458878087	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.480941449017	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.
0.0	0.183355143914	Why is it...
0.0	0.207878721207	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.440126897329	For a start, they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes.
0.0	0.183355143914	No, you did.
0.0	0.172196009285	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.35112112443	I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.
0.0	0.241570307457	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
0.0	0.315112240639	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.212978963153	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.0977981880177	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.513177494605	If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.
0.0	0.0536356596486	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
0.0	0.654427747816	The world has changed.
0.0	0.209909779286	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.329015531793	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.445107038793	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.0907061819056	And what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.134461564328	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.0773747674559	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.167879843375	We were the first in the family.
0.0	0.37609438305	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.15289500574	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.648289303605	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.0579590199181	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
0.0	0.087047718323	Believe me.
0.0	0.365501798059	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.105820790742	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.162978085098	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.173915486298	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.73260480124	... we have the tools in federal law to do this now.
0.0	0.514841053103	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.0729560079541	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.226478464989	And we have to do more to prevent the flood of foreign fighters that have gone to Syria, especially the ones with western passports, that come back.
0.0	0.448500804902	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.224096542912	But, I said, "This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people.
0.0	0.175001747568	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.544735680786	I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
0.0	0.483664203178	So I believe that over the next few years, not tomorrow, but over the next few years, we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.156745897666	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.077226949643	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.604856433008	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.243810162371	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
0.0	0.783719064092	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.106583618393	That's fine.
0.0	0.267389193761	How are they going to beat ISIS?
0.0	0.28407673239	I don't get any money from Wall Street.
0.0	0.1306359962	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.141683253111	And you have to really work hard at it.
0.0	0.295465116917	I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.
0.0	0.0188789355109	I like China.
0.0	0.29503339052	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.380399123233	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.241029079686	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.289168010266	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.367387990741	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.32097904685	What have you got now?
0.0	0.391623909534	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.
0.0	0.225360074072	Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.
0.0	0.26597194025	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.

0.0	0.11525752297	Look, the secretary is right.
0.0	0.200164790437	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.

0.0	0.473495959639	Now, this takes, David, 18 months to 24 months, two years.
0.0	0.327690132238	And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion, this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us, and that we stand with them as they have stood with us.

0.0	0.111042020482	We're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.110591520172	We have losers.
0.0	0.351947642186	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.0655377259812	And you know what?
0.0	0.293637242693	This nation is the most powerful military in the world.
0.0	0.13576085406	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.386383228118	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.0276374654767	We don't need that.

0.0	0.20967981822	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.221487715465	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.182673899361	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.70674310585	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.312352643272	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.203239585023	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.0578368725505	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.235586431998	I mean, let's talk about this arc of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about.
0.0	0.293875100082	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.115933306021	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.0671526512176	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.21356940289	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.209868955194	I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.
0.0	0.160281523596	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.206328384334	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.639435517221	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.379551963394	The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.0144512195959	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.353530211151	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.254574021881	When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it.
0.0	0.254196808394	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.0657459446974	They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
0.0	0.0442744044825	That's calling it what it is.
0.0	0.0612719752182	I have a problem with that, Martha.
0.0	0.766283445239	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...
0.0	0.249346192593	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.315749529873	We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.
0.0	0.414817614564	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.139768061638	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.260544401479	I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out.
1.0	0.906003380132	They were wrong.
0.0	0.44683315565	Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.
0.0	0.199717587776	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.422931179312	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.209627165128	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.0154206706812	And that's what's happening.
0.0	0.307736513523	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.
0.0	0.236601399377	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.0432226850242	Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
0.0	0.0556629493862	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.29746143166	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.0468530480547	And I'm confident we can do that.
0.0	0.143719045053	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.039279939462	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.924291906113	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.0378503871529	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.
0.0	0.567899117162	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.120721516434	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.0719752645451	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.190608624266	Well, David, I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country.
0.0	0.196534492327	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.
0.0	0.969961803845	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.156616979441	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.730997095847	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.131872470191	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.308608980414	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.0977572311546	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.198998702846	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.673586893037	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.0309014372621	And guess what?
0.0	0.110896965232	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.184647718464	Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.
0.0	0.566222332073	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.211332325392	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.0703743889428	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.286345750102	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.461259494031	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.395383885232	It is enormously complicated.
0.0	0.381983663852	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.189717083105	He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments.
0.0	0.0554343903185	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.0684624691592	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.36648564775	But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that.
0.0	0.119911043512	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.380317113287	But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.
0.0	0.294423551451	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.26298470373	That is abundantly clear.
0.0	0.841995780728	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
0.0	0.165682666597	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.174528131161	So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.
0.0	0.140868099931	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.29690895203	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.31315221073	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.447073493432	We have more people in jail today than any other country on earth.
0.0	0.135564124295	That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.
0.0	0.300906444532	So I would say, "Congratulations.
1.0	0.946533905375	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.215583664644	We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America.
0.0	0.183355143914	Do it.
0.0	0.244934359058	I think the issue here is -- and I applaud Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.835624289562	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.173877067252	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.24590883292	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.448287984924	The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.
0.0	0.183454812901	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.150438160542	Now, this is getting to be fun.
0.0	0.19435685576	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.462572265557	And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.319094931809	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
0.0	0.249740564406	... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
0.0	0.0752323554052	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.402029556608	On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center.
0.0	0.112037689729	They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).
0.0	0.309311365371	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.341485756459	And I have to tell you, I would not want -- if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my health care.
0.0	0.122923299164	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.183613309751	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.675459010905	We don't eliminate Medicare.
0.0	0.0998749893186	We needed 60.
0.0	0.18889898756	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.111412693825	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.124090361325	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.116292132475	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.247801826618	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.0655377259812	You know that.
0.0	0.282861465083	We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up.
0.0	0.183355143914	...
1.0	0.920946824552	We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.0672346394098	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.246624235769	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.141032431823	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.729281552637	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.0465129533127	He didn't know.
0.0	0.0608042587671	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.34910815928	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.308427959198	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.15262977742	I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.388007014338	You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?
0.0	0.785959068564	It's campaign -- a corrupt campaign finance system.
1.0	0.98572124848	And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.
0.0	0.15222146859	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.10230440577	And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth.
0.0	0.305711067021	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.699016587139	I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal.
1.0	0.330240384103	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.102544144021	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.0582581609524	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.285595929579	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.0300367844096	Let's have a Democratic Syria.
0.0	0.124048105329	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.253396492843	(inaudible).
0.0	0.282838414586	I mean, my dad went to college on a G.I.
1.0	0.191597945718	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.118365886336	I beat China all the time.
0.0	0.152040556038	Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.
0.0	0.901613535617	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.0588672894472	You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches.
0.0	0.345721205098	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.159726607591	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.589903796426	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.328013267801	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.051443526981	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.5	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.411599124956	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
1.0	0.999991342268	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.147220112909	We'll be filing it right on time.
0.0	0.65869786212	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.194634459296	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
0.0	0.0758111904582	You have a problem with ISIS.
0.0	0.154289231364	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.255572613672	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.651176193362	Since, you know, the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody.
0.0	0.37233309792	But, of course, international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today.
0.0	0.482454253636	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.202950094916	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.432382340477	What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the Muslim nations in that region who are going to have to fight and defend their way of life.
0.0	0.468279250396	No, it's true.
0.0	0.335460129296	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.300502324687	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.304266737892	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.0690705741193	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.152323046504	Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS.
0.0	0.0515637673876	And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.
0.0	0.231345928356	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.351176857108	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.
0.0	0.107769529612	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.
1.0	0.997180531647	I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance.
1.0	0.525462971779	But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works.
0.0	0.131671891327	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.239393452233	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.0470702321564	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.667393410682	I have a comprehensive, tough plan.
0.0	0.343766270826	You've got to go the extra mile.
0.0	0.822869673455	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.0296574899733	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.172228592581	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.183355143914	And...
0.0	0.0629718327715	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.32043296834	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.337851130434	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.314409656872	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.478950486967	I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
0.0	0.214549698138	You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?
0.0	0.196779833958	And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work.
0.0	0.235063182686	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.143168303773	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.140561881686	And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.
0.0	0.0876736878089	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
1.0	0.668163868495	However, what Alan Krueger said in the piece you're referring to is that if we went to $15, there are no international comparisons.
0.0	0.137562242414	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.17724600268	Good company.... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in -- and I wouldn't even use -- you know, I have -- I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.388533902998	Again, with all do respect to Secretary Clinton...
0.0	0.659942173277	We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq.
0.0	0.572631539494	May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care?
0.0	0.395658393254	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.263508432987	Everybody got out -- and they kept our equipment.
0.0	0.140660557051	What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy, and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need.
0.0	0.256026720085	And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.
0.0	0.111391885481	We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game.
0.0	0.203227231241	And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said.
1.0	0.999999935276	Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.
0.0	0.919096935854	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
1.0	0.505602887502	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.107496032214	I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.
0.0	0.119468620022	I will find -- within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy.
0.0	0.102729590159	Absolutely.
0.0	0.319536561299	I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country.
0.0	0.189660551891	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.364598664841	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.292522405305	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.153859119313	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.272573265974	Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.651995864521	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.0280247719517	OK?
0.0	0.213472677734	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.14307560993	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.
0.0	0.212243738501	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.440157824304	And in that capacity, I met with just an extraordinary group of people from World War II, from korea, vietnam, all of the wars.
0.0	0.0404027810186	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.451359186567	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.0392180171768	That's right.
0.0	0.219742300587	We're rebuilding many countries.
0.0	0.360534940476	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.273676450452	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.290447321805	You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country.
0.0	0.782911166841	And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to.
0.0	0.311963814493	There are a lot of factors involved in that.
0.0	0.520716674324	Rebuild the country's infrastructure.
0.0	0.183355143914	But...
0.0	0.225057501187	But it's a lot safer.
1.0	0.99999779105	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.152186999408	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.0511583366132	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.368481885929	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.148665155739	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.494235042999	It cannot be contained, it must be defeated.
0.0	0.587001313039	And also -- also, what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health care outcomes are not necessarily that good.
0.0	0.21395238125	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.494262343934	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.298809268163	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.171739760741	Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.
0.0	0.0655377259812	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.295416976627	Saudi Arabia without us is gone.
0.0	0.1239117199	I said, "What's your problem?"
0.0	0.0504200221526	Yes, let's tell the truth, Martin.
0.0	0.321350422485	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.151744386464	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.307915611058	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.163730110535	And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
0.0	0.0497589696972	They're off to China.
0.0	0.0723802368855	We don't need more of the same solutions.
0.0	0.128032517588	I've always listened to you, Megyn.
0.0	0.40364449254	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
0.0	0.356739608832	So I believe that, in fact, this country needs to move towards a living wage.
0.0	0.802285037854	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
1.0	0.58719093088	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.0727087340063	But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that.
0.0	0.179357917706	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
0.0	0.262170204626	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.33216751073	Doctors are quitting.
0.0	0.250540050741	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.414866245042	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.0651679700704	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.46403278284	Nobela (ph) is a rising entrepreneur.
0.0	0.714511746792	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.297692677208	But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.337042066861	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.0392180171768	That's not right.
0.0	0.193065333554	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.0832860616972	When I'm president, that will change.
0.0	0.354179697017	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.602889050442	But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance.
0.0	0.17947418705	We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.
0.0	0.183227327662	Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...
0.0	0.244723668168	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.611511690111	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.280568709986	End -- end Common Core.
0.0	0.334700814123	We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.
0.0	0.545305405949	And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.
0.0	0.0813967531467	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.359015647158	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.0905061088253	The Secretary's obviously right.
0.0	0.153247877498	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.232665474497	Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS.
1.0	0.976434640565	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.261615758546	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.240892551593	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.836877007629	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.0935179973016	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.0465129533127	He didn't know.
1.0	0.962889530756	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.0513548199285	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.0625065563368	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.900705362401	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.151813050076	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.140960771544	I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party's nominee.
0.0	0.199267105063	I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism --
0.0	0.0484875274362	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.140735023605	Can I -- can I -- I just...
0.0	0.358980442471	By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa.
0.0	0.24502015369	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.975732018653	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.513202525991	So it is difficult.
0.0	0.69191269335	The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress.
0.0	0.5	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.261664162816	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.0704822691885	And we got to look at the big picture here.
1.0	0.864082498013	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.773604667144	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.364966353031	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.173216275985	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.265371529204	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.348670765342	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.348928639497	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.820169641267	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
1.0	0.979305913557	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.73920177472	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.352024892438	But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything.
0.0	0.192943192811	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.315392093315	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.115972329729	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
0.0	0.996610577737	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.179044645899	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.290895603983	To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.
0.0	0.148473837631	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.126457913253	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
0.0	0.191975835711	You can -- you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.
0.0	0.212150815076	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.276869822789	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
0.0	0.114473672473	He'll say.
0.0	0.160815927491	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.184563142889	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.0283685736137	I will not do that.
0.0	0.457731991192	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.328707512887	My heart, like all of us in this room, John, and all the people across our country, my hearts go out to the people of France in this moment of loss.
0.0	0.0128414789987	I happen to think...
0.0	0.00269773494444	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.222613642996	I'll advertise my Web site as well.
0.0	0.312619413868	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.911459034896	Fifty-one percent of high school African-American graduates are unemployed or underemployed.
0.0	0.229495113939	But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.
0.0	0.250089317132	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.230398513075	You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.
0.0	0.0509411933512	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.413856870988	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.202766329077	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.490303546778	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.288452684245	There are many crises that come -- a water crisis in Toledo.
0.0	0.151947938019	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.170751350624	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.11876919504	There won't be any -- you can get it.
0.0	0.123812055666	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.131974849619	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.436769478668	This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.
0.0	0.0708258329473	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
1.0	0.886342597504	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.115665363388	It's great to be back.
0.0	0.223370145332	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.332808757061	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.164365479959	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.178403684508	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.120169658328	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.5	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.102239955881	Wall Street today has too much political power.
0.0	0.265005055075	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.52347114794	No, both the federal and a state approach.
0.0	0.341063435095	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.179742115126	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.194897004366	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.034508437147	Okay, thank you.
0.0	0.468279250396	It's true.
0.0	0.47633963684	Secretary Clinton is right.
0.0	0.1834174088	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.172956049408	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.464329307433	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
0.0	0.0540955265844	My point is this.
0.0	0.23763027513	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.273121469804	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.577410816079	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.151558173125	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.482933280082	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.135441594123	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.406206376558	And that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity -- kill people who are unarmed who should not be killed, they must be held accountable.
0.0	0.285687743068	We were attacked from Afghanistan.
0.0	0.375423053877	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.666241802561	I hire people, they do a Web site.
0.0	0.130426184024	They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn.
0.0	0.136545791765	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.1404563978	But we came together.
0.0	0.0355906508674	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.141132521561	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.226640099992	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.172022593748	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.142042132592	I know every one.
0.0	0.215375514459	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.274842625396	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.0833792791258	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.417824451494	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.127206932555	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.188900025948	And Abdullah said something recently, very important.
0.0	0.83893221593	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.562233129692	But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks.
0.0	0.0199294855675	David...
0.0	0.284052505966	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.248396652642	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.232733455878	I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.
0.0	0.0101905027662	No, I love them.
0.0	0.298369319013	And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.145645167329	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.611959177643	Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers.
0.0	0.312624555705	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.49406602037	And I was determined to do everything that I could to make VA health care the best in the world, to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending.
0.0	0.147720848773	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.562677738206	But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
0.0	0.0630719927106	I want a job."
0.0	0.213722683628	But they're killing us economically.
0.0	0.192927128412	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.216297768325	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.92890168379	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.061423120059	Oh, great.
0.0	0.144626083346	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.0915746735887	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.213819162727	But states need to do more as well.
0.0	0.108442504529	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.0744324458482	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.144101114649	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
0.0	0.130213740635	I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.
0.0	0.240011924139	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.101180193677	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.867834562019	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.218642833944	A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.
0.0	0.429199674708	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.119635471924	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.136242114235	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.334786018351	That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable.
0.0	0.274666675338	You bet they do.
0.0	0.0908402156838	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.478528968932	And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.
0.0	0.775116621842	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.366120264826	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.462783877082	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.0829193023019	I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country.
0.0	0.183355143914	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.198199372154	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.196646091954	It was terrible.
0.0	0.233688821272	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.00249295632677	Look--
1.0	0.937072777362	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.116426376489	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.0321237226421	Sure.
0.0	0.109383168144	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.183355143914	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.249528767199	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.
0.0	0.19105455871	That's what I understand is the request from the international...
0.0	0.0834798687101	But I was born here.
0.0	0.105077468589	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
1.0	0.919200315324	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.0998528047736	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.649026153916	And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.
0.0	0.1243292868	That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.
0.0	0.0617956464107	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.645743285486	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.218962965507	... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street.
0.0	0.245486036266	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.253651343085	There are no simple solutions.
0.0	0.423461628572	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.183355143914	So did you.
0.0	0.222907731705	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.0913967032548	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.127665825111	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.229738753455	And second of all...
0.0	0.115270867223	I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.
0.0	0.459958791422	Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody.
0.0	0.176379052049	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.628596408411	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.904499404166	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
1.0	0.056820872679	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.159641968564	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.809113544791	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.536069438109	Number one, you have people in this country that...
1.0	0.931193888568	That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.
0.0	0.913376173679	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
0.0	0.435672348646	If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.
0.0	0.300204292211	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
1.0	0.97661962985	Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?
1.0	0.999996858419	So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education.
0.0	0.0722460726111	We will do very, very well, very, very well.
0.0	0.0247788688361	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.526005541514	But I went further than that.
0.0	0.259987601618	It's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement.
0.0	0.386952619649	He cut and run.
0.0	0.17970316674	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.189662061667	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.333160905319	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
0.0	0.323549992089	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.192363437403	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.201867782473	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.216889309221	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.381443894657	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.388313193477	They want American troops back in the Middle East.
0.0	0.367441079525	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.
0.0	0.268606786904	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.45770239692	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.2625738385	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.127547724208	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.056995628538	So Hillary and I have a difference.
0.0	0.122069256811	For her convenience.
0.0	0.764647275606	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
0.0	0.127304864145	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.290347185064	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.294017123666	And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.0178403054666	And, look, there are profound differences...
0.0	0.112097899285	We overcame the NRA's objections.
0.0	0.066109054988	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.40281888106	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.0452473357794	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.

0.0	0.592622331699	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.

0.0	0.881172393327	Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts.
0.0	0.108564588094	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.

0.0	0.373411023888	I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to -- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.

0.0	0.526600741968	First of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy, as you've indicated.
0.0	0.617934749286	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.0632738720291	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.222080950595	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.35230324928	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.146749317683	They beat us all the time.
0.0	0.351173719745	And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.
0.0	0.12185202041	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.183355143914	No.
0.0	0.0815430991984	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.372838594915	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.158082227888	But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.
0.0	0.461939622752	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.600555051114	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.257937414496	Otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.
0.0	0.154183368879	We need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table.
0.0	0.603408345887	I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader.
0.0	0.0629181016734	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.00731161979203	How would we act?
0.0	0.233195457955	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.368430848692	And those countries who are opposed to Islam, they are going to have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today.
0.0	0.0392180171768	Right.
0.0	0.541639620151	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.78059920347	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.259742149636	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
0.0	0.272506423158	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.240877844994	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.16653444848	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.0856588070785	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.484206568552	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.382432094833	I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks.
0.0	0.224885619952	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
1.0	0.994576257286	And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.160777244959	So the reporter said to me the other day, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person.
0.0	0.283912840244	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.0647826356855	I don't think we're at war with Islam.
0.0	0.0261307789891	I hate to hear it."
0.0	0.871239207179	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.0557371381559	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.388426981554	We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.
0.0	0.726788773254	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.140569059122	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.0659539822874	We saw that in Egypt.
0.0	0.345127551652	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.539951338366	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.142471198575	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
0.0	0.733004820629	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.262381041836	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.216412868108	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.337992157024	He invoked mine as well.
0.0	0.0194475844906	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.152940220278	Today I heard it.
0.0	0.428414263725	I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor, I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very, very powerful and most important of all jobs in the United States, the president, whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country.
0.0	0.750669030333	You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.107182813114	Marco can change his mind.
0.0	0.905307090958	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.0407772616313	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.119918556508	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.016777823958	Think about it.
0.0	0.919975005931	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.183355143914	I was not at all.
0.0	0.376792873833	I met recently with some members of the Chaldean Christian communities and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months.
0.0	0.305796021265	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.5	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.329557396279	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.132611546691	There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out.
0.0	0.116921841677	I don't think we're at war with all Muslims.
0.0	0.0847814976295	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.
0.0	0.455385897459	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.552992626247	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.141098243505	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.168481045534	Yes, I'm getting...
0.0	0.118335852651	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.127428905374	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.205254113894	So the fact is that we work for the people.
0.0	0.09453241664	Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name.
0.0	0.357660655522	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.121464343819	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.448973528483	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.975372793499	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.303738709466	Number one, we're going to keep ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.191193081927	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
0.0	0.206359914394	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.689718983294	He's weak on immigration.
0.0	0.848719560442	Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978.
0.0	0.228807224179	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
1.0	0.973461565976	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.0289580703026	I don't think so.
0.0	0.290976374863	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.0996819877928	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.77511762923	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.369358071303	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.377963398319	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.242069989682	Yes, exactly, exactly.

0.0	0.250420782542	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.0524076242473	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.454680317237	And it has three parts.
0.0	0.220512925978	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.247681856071	A lot of the rights that have been won over years, from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights, will be at risk.

0.0	0.738525862625	We were the first to pass a minimum wage.
0.0	0.184149355735	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.115401836145	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.0289580703026	So I don't think...
0.0	0.319285309674	KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.
0.0	0.390606167441	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.644373563345	There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction.
0.0	0.0390749526394	We are rebuilding China.
0.0	0.663731565559	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.122653597862	I'm running.
0.0	0.319671656005	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.00894659045934	You don't have to.
0.0	0.250670189569	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.61155717227	I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
0.0	0.2156088562	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.376072201754	I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground.
0.0	0.622519732536	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.777719064687	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.332795636899	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.103910129474	He said, "You know, I make great product."
0.0	0.331754166579	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.119185937345	I could only get two Republican votes on that.

0.0	0.0801557814933	I am the son and grandson of immigrants.
0.0	0.5	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.0813967531467	Let me respond...
0.0	0.119463132209	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.320441755435	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.599591343717	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.290849647193	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.702028214119	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.15841538481	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.

0.0	0.189149180316	Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.303540047058	But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks."
0.0	0.21268072291	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.688128278719	Secretary Clinton also said we -- it was not just the invasion of Iraq which Secretary Clinton voted for and has since said was a big mistake -- and, indeed, it was.
0.0	0.48839149307	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.94782148412	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
0.0	0.550428231782	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
1.0	0.99999078063	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
0.0	0.237405974272	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.887501455418	We're up 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.283530836702	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.729845924299	You do legislation.
0.0	0.569610191475	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.631466528746	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.267579524819	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.

0.0	0.284042289144	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
1.0	0.201161555378	I think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street...
0.0	0.263081776095	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.0691867966374	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.985077378431	About Medicare?
0.0	0.927288039567	If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.
0.0	0.00249295632677	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.177716330115	You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911.
0.0	0.165507255226	This will end.
0.0	0.346983901821	We got a U.N. Security council vote.

0.0	0.0756683068641	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.0430591501665	But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future.
0.0	0.109352544554	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.102729590159	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.110996648515	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.0799208022698	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
1.0	0.991534346628	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.0396618516398	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.0671481331142	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.146059589304	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
0.0	0.180843315057	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.461044325109	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.674458091768	We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.
0.0	0.0991828048189	Yeah.
0.0	0.0596609957085	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.392085136502	I never said that.
0.0	0.040338706397	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.260341704434	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.771939805202	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.111550976374	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.101249001459	I don't think a halt is necessary.
0.0	0.713832150316	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.0338613922494	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.175189711746	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.418332917132	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.612519015264	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.456270745213	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
0.0	0.146819095315	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.341294116846	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.0655377259812	And you know what?
0.0	0.124687567739	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.506471267347	This group needs to be confronted and defeated.
0.0	0.770666096686	When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish Glass-Stegall.
0.0	0.275008846813	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.0531188746593	And here's what's going to happen.
0.0	0.136854300746	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.804216481873	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.275531128031	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.17231980362	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.
0.0	0.103225585955	That's a wonderful business model.
0.0	0.168884776053	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.112522081977	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.
0.0	0.144141829373	This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.
0.0	0.137626551623	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.168401977034	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.148765330648	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.124938646374	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.0682122649146	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.488964765068	He thinks low wages are a good idea.
0.0	0.159763512771	Check it out.
0.0	0.429375488569	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.016777823958	They think they are.
0.0	0.385240671	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.246007396816	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.432640683042	There's no nation on earth that comes close to that number.
0.0	0.798450260409	Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.
0.0	0.252603189451	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.275230217124	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.153840914279	But let's be clear.
0.0	0.071957766839	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.377363964804	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.193753930303	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.338945669476	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.0817948017676	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
0.0	0.135790964185	That is exactly...
1.0	0.997187146617	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.335086173328	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.26847565787	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.
0.0	0.206209608594	In addition to that...
0.0	0.196426966626	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.0629003867182	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.170286935998	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.220617113474	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.418180229155	And he also had no trouble appointing an investment banker to be in charge of his consumer protection bureau when he was governor.
1.0	0.947158706061	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.276278359966	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.167618119577	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.341943727433	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.685780431756	I changed that.
0.0	0.33203870093	We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
0.0	0.553168911413	I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.
0.0	0.809941561956	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.1030741233	We are at war with violent extremism.
0.0	0.0836870755181	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.28553253152	But I said, "Don't hit Iraq," because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East.
0.0	0.146841383915	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
0.0	0.267847848558	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.408025345512	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.273589756773	If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country.
0.0	0.243130622301	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.247523651772	Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength.
0.0	0.622176716601	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.186261623864	And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.
0.0	0.189330638684	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.868533568032	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.068946094972	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.189644568253	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.303242925625	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.228596063837	Nobody can do that like me.
0.0	0.424763367084	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
0.0	0.272399640109	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.297533932665	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.365020451529	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.114966641727	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.218278620031	They can't even answer simple questions.
0.0	0.232268136656	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.101589365268	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.407388579897	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.130507459204	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.31439720681	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.183355143914	...
1.0	0.329085445199	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.304671193332	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.329952081264	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.413325421738	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.124163525934	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.768110232994	In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.
0.0	0.155341554797	One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy.
0.0	0.258773159948	And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
0.0	0.987987195847	We defended the highest median income in the country.
0.0	0.176829872891	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.671632517613	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.918170807788	We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally.
0.0	0.49303307763	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.320976147148	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.091785099689	Predominantly African-American and Hispanic.
0.0	0.746294175685	Yes, well, roughly.
0.0	0.191003495852	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.885850294645	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.991621397683	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.158797243612	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.12299923133	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.552202453556	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.645506494796	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
0.0	0.196985378768	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.

0.0	0.182533649648	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
1.0	0.897972247063	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.0450690539383	Alright.
0.0	0.795725061586	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.166064135294	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.
0.0	0.125074320894	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.195683672534	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.363360202669	And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't.
0.0	0.274511870253	And we have people that are controlled by special interests.
0.0	0.41406568554	ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries.
0.0	0.398550103202	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.0894401866461	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.354889737745	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.251245153169	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.296639986298	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.0618922133898	I said, "I don't need it.
0.0	0.605366798429	But here, a total net worth of -- net worth, not assets, not -- a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets -- Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York -- many other places all over the world.
0.0	0.283707849561	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.
0.0	0.232906982593	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.254286637654	Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take.
0.0	0.181067893146	So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly.
0.0	0.355323067116	We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love -- they're great -- all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.
0.0	0.895311239004	We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government.
0.0	0.100250022393	But I'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya, you would be looking at Syria.
0.0	0.245649062157	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.307468182964	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.220098499271	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.770135516801	So under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system.
0.0	0.439676637278	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.248729981153	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.0550599430145	That's good.
1.0	0.992483886483	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.331664884548	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.307076830056	So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.
0.0	0.323507442286	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.174032759964	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.204409702027	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.302171374357	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.256710779969	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.840806349144	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.18925491746	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.237698188838	But wait, I just want to say this Senator.
0.0	0.127698667144	I love this country.
0.0	0.455587829349	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.448729166674	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.082210482467	And, they asked about her email situation.
0.0	0.461020060193	They wanted Boeing's secrets.
0.0	0.192832244722	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.149843736003	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.245669501897	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.105585637675	How stupid are our leaders?
0.0	0.207731308603	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.466689946652	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.720412153314	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.0728050457475	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.157145709784	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.125731758685	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.303528065002	And we ought to fight them on that level.
0.0	0.295251872689	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.551420137138	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.453396435723	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.14915309873	Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy.
0.0	0.234856885283	And, of course, I met the mothers of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, and Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and so many of them who have lost their children.
0.0	0.210351897814	So, your original question is the right question.
0.0	0.0511583366132	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.659008611055	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.183408722672	We only have one or two.
0.0	0.157956486603	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.404126622151	Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place.
0.0	0.545841480954	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.44648774738	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.111415258959	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.468136369135	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.811040157901	Illegal.
0.0	0.183321015274	Yes.
0.0	0.239696952487	The no-fly zone, I would hope, would be also shared by Russia.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.58844604591	I was not the secretary of state...
1.0	0.999999933156	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.107998503641	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.0571793508705	They serve in the military.
1.0	0.982344807806	There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign.
0.0	0.317478414328	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.424866153432	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.176745454057	And, we said no.
0.0	0.146873014031	Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
0.0	0.5	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.137626551623	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.233532538453	I've laid out...
0.0	0.0974752137176	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.650460347587	You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.
0.0	0.0422806227914	It can happen.
0.0	0.317897790782	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.198169503212	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.970444921901	But you would index it -- you would index it to the median wage.
0.0	0.0508556905893	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.0701221663809	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.371250651446	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.274436529155	They come up to my office.
0.0	0.236263214521	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.469525256686	When he brought forward the "Gang of Eight" bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.
0.0	0.336338630423	We've got to build a coalition abroad.
0.0	0.512349528823	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.105262454776	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.579193465208	We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001.
0.0	0.489194241935	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
0.0	0.525177358951	You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
0.0	0.267235616071	They went to the DNC quietly.
0.0	0.183355143914	Not at all.
0.0	0.442787614033	And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.
0.0	0.103031491849	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.215310194499	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.786335154285	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.0683333873424	So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do.
0.0	0.341381831338	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.087047718323	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.287450118621	The Libyans turned out for one of the most successful, fairest elections that any Arab country has had.
0.0	0.220862356809	And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump," and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns.
0.0	0.716728435985	We both made the identical promises.
0.0	0.172690258654	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.278244715405	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
0.0	0.440269894352	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.120344885992	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.337459503462	When somebody is addicted and seeking help, they should not have to wait three, four months in order to get that help.
0.0	0.63725904781	Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.
0.0	0.512601616153	She's an American citizen.
0.0	0.109431898264	And the answer is: Because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda.
0.0	0.295700342543	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.0280247719517	OK.
0.0	0.2118073294	Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home.
0.0	0.284899920435	At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically.
0.0	0.229264555235	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.112162597344	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.0997833580456	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.0465129533127	Don't know that.
0.0	0.126402731268	So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.
0.0	0.231693192088	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.40677448352	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
0.0	0.086400910157	I'm going to support you, and I think that is absolutely appropriate.
0.0	0.170008138157	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.406967830157	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.804477060322	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.278646380648	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.158826934196	From top to bottom.
0.0	0.238042645641	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.146253640974	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.136141778246	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
1.0	0.834218361935	People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.
0.0	0.578143568801	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.722053587541	Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.
0.0	0.408081938787	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.304933317116	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.0831717233501	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
0.0	0.753252197251	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.0595510699132	You don't serve us.
0.0	0.301349248555	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.0605670197222	We all understand that.
0.0	0.0558180866891	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.270145922144	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.199902162215	Well, they're glitches because...
0.0	0.0280247719517	OK?
1.0	0.705754757385	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.384982269864	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.147621185122	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.0679169953797	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.477667225873	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.301357650264	My mother's dream -- and she died very young, but my mother's dream for her whole life was to be able to get out of that rent-controlled apartment and own a home of her own.
0.0	0.183355143914	That has not been...
0.0	0.247249997096	We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.
0.0	0.0582581609524	No problem.
0.0	0.299929593971	Afghanistan is a mess.
0.0	0.286009124179	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.465051075603	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.
0.0	0.0963817582906	Let me say this.
0.0	0.120502954356	I'm getting to that.
0.0	0.00681605116502	That's what our parents and grandparents always did.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.073909552377	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.161533198354	With all -- with all due respect...
0.0	0.276672329905	And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.100796768735	It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.
0.0	0.219450714671	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.241828227412	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.51649747172	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.11836785912	He's an entertaining guy.
0.0	0.431097867089	First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, "they cannot have it all."
0.0	0.183677146475	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.251100900596	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.0479685705349	That's the good news.
0.0	0.916949405228	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.35476237778	That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive.
0.0	0.0596096260299	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.135095994316	And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?
0.0	0.0655377259812	And you know what?
0.0	0.236868282365	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.33518245953	Got to go to Haiti last year.
0.0	0.102335855894	But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand.
0.0	0.285487974096	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.278569376658	You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.
0.0	0.179480907029	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.149653080717	I said, "Very interesting."
0.0	0.27604811134	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.624242365744	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.235599350499	And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.
0.0	0.0829363131262	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.395174851243	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.809711875666	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.721474306098	My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.
0.0	0.174191756294	They're sending us not the right people.
0.0	0.17133346436	We need to move aggressively now.
0.0	0.780449697892	Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor.
0.0	0.392577613176	This is not the type of campaign that we run.
0.0	0.36761688663	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.877912085666	Those hedge funds.
0.0	0.0851291390436	Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
0.0	0.229360724987	Or a young woman who had been performing at President Obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member.
1.0	0.99007173449	When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.
0.0	0.114428129593	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.836611746895	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.1860029454	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.0463517669848	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.177745055435	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.250084724922	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.247950553886	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.191614988422	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.286188142595	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.55817578885	We haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.
0.0	0.310765227322	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.269234733259	Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.

0.0	0.0655377259812	How do I know this?
0.0	0.0148530586227	...Thank you.
0.0	0.0692571028851	You want to know why things don't get done in Washington?
0.0	0.620459453121	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
1.0	0.901899308083	And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions.
0.0	0.582808552101	It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act.
0.0	0.314058761539	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.153915327318	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.0810936190488	Why didn't they call the police?
1.0	0.669216117339	Today, we have about 4,000.
0.0	0.412531690701	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
1.0	0.518279744419	I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded.
0.0	0.554498658255	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.17970316674	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.299281839556	But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.
0.0	0.364051270379	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.160281523596	Bottom line.
0.0	0.454490504475	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
0.0	0.195441388591	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
0.0	0.171986587919	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.347048494939	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.151373429477	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.

0.0	0.171674488618	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.144477787413	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
1.0	0.972333487084	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.100218985462	And he is a proud American Muslim.
0.0	0.120539120367	You can't do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they're as threatened as we are.
0.0	0.318683193652	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.
0.0	0.264453638531	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.079514128596	How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
0.0	0.515120973832	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.213398429594	We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
0.0	0.0364688653088	Marco, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.521219269887	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.113516039725	But I guess the final thing that -- that I would say is this is the kind of debate we need to take to the Republicans in the fall.
0.0	0.197874232265	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.260970018071	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.128812112011	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.601079271355	I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan.
0.0	0.0978099795595	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.19374598676	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.423158169825	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.0106527353827	And we are not England.
0.0	0.251655611343	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.46789660022	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.358807647038	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.247387607544	Now they're going militarily.
0.0	0.0862981824881	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.382080613873	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.117026562646	But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said.
0.0	0.0964341778417	He was vibrant.
0.0	0.556323310305	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.0930063768123	Thank you Chris...
0.0	0.384184761462	in particular.
0.0	0.657714950922	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.314683633565	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.634597131466	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.285419814242	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.21997544946	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.183355143914	...
0.0	0.111872605246	And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.
0.0	0.188959225288	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.379634196534	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.
0.0	0.157883428158	I started off -- thank you -- I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said -- and I love my father.
0.0	0.440910430068	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.719827441466	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.565059094615	I've prosecuted terrorists.
0.0	0.0369353877207	They're a great family.
0.0	0.694888616051	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.0844193345104	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.225292278404	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.183355143914	No.
0.0	0.666240992274	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0917573345791	We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States.
0.0	0.0798546669699	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.112017482974	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.72789599953	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.406617290034	All of us want equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.182163776708	I would like to see it updated.
0.0	0.4158915988	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.130352701346	We got it.
0.0	0.181546190645	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.0858985455565	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.166104212717	The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders.
0.0	0.408966573261	Then, in 2008, you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying that we don't need those regulations on the federal level and now you're coming back around here.
0.0	0.150086792701	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.885108118938	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.
0.0	0.844733712373	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.340111703485	He's the greatest show on earth.
0.0	0.257392806069	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.0795045122819	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.304181441568	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.486959640085	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.240603483904	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.151187514703	And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.596454071483	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.72856630671	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.169354176926	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.13065791847	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.272850269841	I've gotten to do some incredible things.
0.0	0.063945808352	And Teddy Roosevelt is right.
0.0	0.38104102638	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.130092959569	...John...
0.0	0.429320455304	People came back from Iraq and Afghanistan without legs, without arms.
0.0	0.440912774692	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.477056418933	... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.192489871443	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.462328954632	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.08092852029	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.611254839546	So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.
0.0	0.31308756115	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.604202210152	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.0973139829853	Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen?
0.0	0.0519580640534	Man (ph), their mother's here as well.
0.0	0.084409347971	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.0980830396181	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.445632757161	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.20242374788	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.117459784515	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.346061960776	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.100955106548	Becky --
0.0	0.0982490758068	We need security.
0.0	0.289780731486	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.0926622845729	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.307655131884	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
0.0	0.771359298673	There was a minimum wage at the state level, and some places went higher.
0.0	0.144937964047	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.168022233501	But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country.
0.0	0.106715031554	And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people.
0.0	0.42552075759	And so, you go the extra mile.
0.0	0.629401727203	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.340745294145	Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons.
0.0	0.559191125239	When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.
0.0	0.219044874535	... Chris, your questions that you...
0.0	0.641489604358	Our staff found information on our computers from the Clinton campaign.
0.0	0.126821927007	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.183321015274	Yes.
0.0	0.251056990881	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.433229042295	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.15309606873	All of these are very difficult issues.
0.0	0.334082470724	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.424188136171	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.364143349216	If the United States does not lead, there is not another leader.
0.0	0.565729685805	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.171394864961	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.166560649222	Listen, we can solve immigration.
0.0	0.0750904518333	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.903553215242	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.5	And I have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run.
0.0	0.214723113251	And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.
0.0	0.114843926528	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.0124694583925	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.0745686672644	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.224061228913	They can provide forces.
0.0	0.0724581111406	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.186296364779	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.0526514826657	Let it be for everybody.
0.0	0.59019324464	I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.
0.0	0.0319064766199	Washington is broken.
1.0	0.846968761613	In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.
0.0	0.473591146297	The troops on the ground should not be American troops.
0.0	0.892286526953	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.948263753235	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.256182995854	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.0307030023165	Good evening.
0.0	0.0447637073773	That's kind of a no-brainer.
0.0	0.209571345838	They're building up their military to a point that is very scary.
0.0	0.212157011419	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.101933695247	He's wrong.
0.0	0.196336080227	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.224438743629	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.236807901189	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...
0.0	0.104018432283	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.00769030493756	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.307568046763	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.157643782448	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.233296130259	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.0523755973093	She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.
0.0	0.253396492843	I (inaudible).
0.0	0.0242578943191	The mentally ill?
0.0	0.430785070535	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.0453106850439	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.20788696352	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.171786132043	Well, this whole issue concerns me.
0.0	0.406942722041	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.125444116027	I mean, that's a fact.
0.0	0.426637311818	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.712867706499	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.193632630548	That is not protected religious belief.

0.0	0.11942465837	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.873472782262	That's my bill.

0.0	0.299536424557	We have tremendous people.
0.0	0.438472272542	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.158710968061	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.240765146355	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
0.0	0.0888717637029	It's not supposed to happen that way.
1.0	0.834511555839	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.111436025091	And I believe he is absolutely right.
0.0	0.131673975079	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.322494352487	And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016.
0.0	0.120182160999	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.29101970093	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.167382037685	But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything -- everything, they got away with it again.

0.0	0.1309446962	Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice.
0.0	0.314363374728	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.

0.0	0.244902347468	We need sound money.
0.0	0.373577946582	When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.
0.0	0.0655377259812	You know why?
0.0	0.358676615896	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.0655377259812	But you know what?
0.0	0.530209286223	We can triple the border patrol.

0.0	0.381138560057	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.200328194435	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.0257002044027	That's crony capitalism.
1.0	0.844718093284	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.331776617241	We have to go after what is called the shadow banking industry.

0.0	0.225927466926	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.159809960061	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.458756992667	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.183355143914	Again...
0.0	0.0469162750956	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.980252633046	Real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years.
0.0	0.122936409779	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.0604754426403	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.628236113254	I think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12 it would be the highest historical average we've ever had.
0.0	0.598043061129	Furthermore, in a competitive global economy, it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world.
0.0	0.384629484245	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.57423473153	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.0888733503362	If I am elected president...
0.0	0.0885976816782	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.0617181052755	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
1.0	0.979397955926	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.0139569744845	He was a great negotiator.
0.0	0.0680614482029	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.0760433210564	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.162822518361	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.14073423433	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.477591470593	Meanwhile, the rich get richer.

0.0	0.168732988969	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.319033482781	It was the most highly sought after -- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
0.0	0.209816026271	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.087047718323	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.395180431959	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.395175840134	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.0542970142848	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.145990637043	And we can do it.
0.0	0.139063860159	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.255162537601	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.582486173303	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.183727026328	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.0613361686076	I tell you that.
0.0	0.199040303191	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.383260231979	We need money.
0.0	0.570893883734	You know, on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign, I was in Keene, and I was asked what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?
0.0	0.159586278802	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.346770464616	China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.395885028151	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.127206932555	But what -- I will tell you this.
0.0	0.730739444187	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.40590140786	There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.
0.0	0.280295081391	Like, I'm standing here, I -- I watched the video of Senator Cruz.
0.0	0.0490052264542	There's a lot packed into that statement.
0.0	0.750424793908	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.0406910284267	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.457971914179	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.401637303286	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.520562124886	I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.
0.0	0.377307707312	... and say there is something more important than money.
0.0	0.21673488873	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.900255245516	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.298084722658	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
1.0	0.606273929499	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
1.0	0.906003380132	That's wrong.
0.0	0.288230562647	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.626080446559	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
1.0	0.96962212395	They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
0.0	0.040955313796	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.12808688238	... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before.
0.0	0.22652573394	And, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like Gadhafi, a despot with American blood on his hands, is overturned.
0.0	0.0189271326261	What sense is that?
1.0	0.802836332952	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.751321428156	I've employed -- I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
0.0	0.113407927589	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.364828496078	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.277575151652	More importantly, I want kids in Burlington, Vermont, or Baltimore, Maryland, who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade, who don't have a lot of money, whose parents -- like my parents -- may never have gone to college.
0.0	0.377466955465	It has too much economic power.
0.0	0.248739061103	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.
0.0	0.282373388621	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.315515732704	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.279303686055	Kevin, if I could just jump in.
1.0	0.841624773771	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.0942098915242	I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.
1.0	0.996814465561	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.0739164768128	I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.
0.0	0.992221353591	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.0787496580511	So I've watched the politicians.
0.0	0.308384386766	The list goes on because the differences are so stark.
0.0	0.884068616997	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.145990637043	We can do that.
1.0	0.628230971015	I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer.
0.0	0.13343707906	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.675253325623	So as a nation we need to increase what we invest in Pell grants.
0.0	0.109662812775	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.284675553345	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.0732478732039	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.286391549158	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.170747525586	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.223055077121	John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL, and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening.
0.0	0.42157010231	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.196399525254	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.130686906998	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
0.0	0.0614287739537	Please think of our founding fathers as you listen.
0.0	0.902771330436	But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.
0.0	0.413569905335	If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship.
0.0	0.183355143914	What do we do?
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.975488814908	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.5	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.235506393828	We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
0.0	0.369822701864	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.111527465819	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.174964538689	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.444924180357	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.048096031062	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.602706862026	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.250292286664	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.17258380816	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.282059381525	The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.
0.0	0.149540375215	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?
0.0	0.217871912264	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.120178161215	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.218907181729	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.528381803377	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.0690726799329	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.181650117487	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.127219399577	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.192434391904	She never lived to see that.
0.0	0.0910273175709	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.257573322509	There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
0.0	0.756425197324	Millions coming out of school as you indicated, deeply in debt.
0.0	0.167123936178	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.402946801368	I do respect Rand.
0.0	0.258489191241	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.447205178441	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.243616810946	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.335681094183	I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones.
0.0	0.10178375807	I will be ready.
0.0	0.482497416183	And for my part, I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has.
0.0	0.0409949587653	He does great.
0.0	0.0376144881501	I don't care.
0.0	0.333592192505	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.157086371269	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.271784320219	I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support.
0.0	0.138579564025	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.183355143914	...
0.0	0.297477223289	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
0.0	0.511011206218	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.750855597873	hospital that needs to be improved and made better for them turned over to privatization.
0.0	0.105074013102	We've got nothing.
0.0	0.278474675864	Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country.
0.0	0.901784423212	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.318069570405	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.300845505736	My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.

0.0	0.10199163773	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.591784097916	Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons -- three out of four people in prison are black or brown.

0.0	0.183355143914	No, no.
0.0	0.0624641813694	We need more principle.

0.0	0.65063227089	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.686498950934	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.157270722685	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.

0.0	0.156408293046	So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.
0.0	0.0392706108648	That's off the table...

0.0	0.445183959666	It's virtually useless.
0.0	0.133185837471	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.333474818016	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.0762202986725	And I think that's a mistake, and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways.
0.0	0.580518277045	We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate.
0.0	0.016777823958	Think about it.
0.0	0.017717942923	And God bless America.
0.0	0.546913056795	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.

0.0	0.208179875872	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.683981336488	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
1.0	0.983276962366	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.

0.0	0.0682541309846	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.371451227603	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.

0.0	0.269819794558	And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.
0.0	0.429789831377	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.51550140426	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.164141135498	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.1369452684	I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it.
0.0	0.0619610600433	... and I'd like to respond.
0.0	0.150590883196	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.016777823958	Think of it.
0.0	0.188220420267	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.
0.0	0.315622550353	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.313871115367	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill.

0.0	0.216006513247	Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris.
0.0	0.18073335479	Here's a fact.

0.0	0.191188092772	The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.
0.0	0.247825448179	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.620158903471	I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...
0.0	0.120362523543	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.

0.0	0.0596751218755	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.484954059412	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.464319672718	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.

0.0	0.183355143914	What are we doing?
0.0	0.138544014766	And we have -- and let me make this promise.

0.0	0.341911810442	Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform.
0.0	0.837299967669	We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.

0.0	0.197240845132	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.308641391435	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.
0.0	0.0392180171768	Right.

0.0	0.0518503799103	Are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not?
0.0	0.815165711836	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.167117972436	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.136978019293	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.298614122819	And she turned around many lives.
0.0	0.288767601449	We must able to work collaboratively with others.
0.0	0.0179372677741	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.645675391629	We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.
0.0	0.345721205098	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.128546286485	We talked about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.123577967523	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.869653701284	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.331960925	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.00896763400555	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.397563576739	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.218970013455	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.119751599282	Here's the story.
0.0	0.20994204272	You know where their United States headquarters is located?
0.0	0.672090096684	I voted against the war.
0.0	0.00350215077454	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.908666177962	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.247985367058	Because you realize that people depending on you.
0.0	0.129952692561	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.0240870356483	As a Catholic, that's what I want to do.
0.0	0.818332991163	Not assets."
0.0	0.186724504599	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.183355143914	And why?
0.0	0.384896013942	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.667834468073	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.197385653825	And that this world, with American leadership, can and must come together to destroy them.
0.0	0.352936165253	But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone.
0.0	0.238078399241	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.550906554779	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.328773637064	Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability.
0.0	0.101933695247	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.193158358973	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.201911291159	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.044544639729	Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down.
1.0	0.962152037873	Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.
0.0	0.5	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?
0.0	0.316767227054	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
1.0	0.339104723956	A lot of people up there can't get jobs.
0.0	0.196796852994	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.205854436624	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.207408931988	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.560577773648	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
0.0	0.237539234853	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.
0.0	0.182517750589	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.0297779314022	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.
0.0	0.183355143914	No.
0.0	0.0392180171768	That's right.
0.0	0.0367438579041	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.462233926769	You can go to opensecrets.org and check that.
0.0	0.537551773662	You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization.
0.0	0.0318684997023	And that is what we have done in Ohio.
0.0	0.146952308462	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.369378441705	And I understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary.
0.0	0.0655377259812	But you know what?
0.0	0.182761118975	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.69242819653	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.651302852853	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.239098929727	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.
0.0	0.113203419789	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.224217157275	What a brilliant idea that would be.
0.0	0.139763544255	I would just say that...
0.0	0.154287049806	How stupid are they?
0.0	0.169053714691	And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.
0.0	0.221105792826	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.168649011088	We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.
1.0	0.365883737224	Well, we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists.
0.0	0.767051835975	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.694217513132	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
0.0	0.384052958082	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.198114294859	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.0442165464288	Chris, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.372249349521	So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out.
0.0	0.254391153233	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.511663855715	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.105833157436	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.
0.0	0.714024944478	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.130086421827	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.508097933821	You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?
1.0	0.63671198758	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.0280247719517	OK.
0.0	0.087047718323	Here's what I believe.
0.0	0.171316309817	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.0321237226421	Sure did.
0.0	0.587067163097	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	0.0657728811565	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.201332524071	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
0.0	0.533237780012	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.396016756067	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.969857261455	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.0803713885998	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.410619110874	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.12925274332	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.314427140083	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.281143275281	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.660816491743	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.214445768069	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.399359661455	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.128145048029	I think we're at war with jihadists who have --
0.0	0.0388968334582	Creativity.
0.0	0.0975154273863	We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets.
0.0	0.227620421251	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.544214577572	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.242729606647	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.333055679142	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.97027746813	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.118345196375	And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition, including Russia, to help us destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.246270382114	All of us believe climate change is real.
0.0	0.233765530103	Ever.
0.0	0.454978529158	They should have made it more open ended for the next president.
0.0	0.152170049295	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.909435034927	Of course, you would.
0.0	0.205915690571	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.139571517034	Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day.
0.0	0.0844995600082	I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is.
0.0	0.52760620622	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.37104607871	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.103085917866	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.191345121149	... family leave for a very long time...
0.0	0.183355143914	What should we do?
0.0	0.437811551971	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.0450326802407	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.163158764373	We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is.
0.0	0.404919820914	Given the fact that she's a lot smarter than me, yes, she would.
0.0	0.434989070701	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.169437554132	And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce's great story.
0.0	0.195346249169	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.344865818248	They are much more than that.
1.0	0.702182461305	$10.10 was all I could get the state to do by the time I left in my last year.
0.0	0.00269773494444	It is a disaster.
0.0	0.429725404984	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
0.0	0.246880931626	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.39976189825	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.0916224134525	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.338392221761	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.295548645399	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.156139675238	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.273269039397	I think we need major reform in the military, making it more cost effective, but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us.
0.0	0.111097385627	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.391854772995	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.268336164211	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.218292274845	I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.266108014615	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.270394371169	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
0.0	0.0231059121343	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.059660873585	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.170391546957	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.70334342712	Who are we kidding?
0.0	0.0316209818679	That's not fair.
0.0	0.130478141018	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.183321015274	Yes.
0.0	0.41993911345	All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.
0.0	0.159091964635	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.258828670316	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.5	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.153144484612	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.141707683222	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.251680389403	We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS, which is a danger to us as well as the region... SANDERS (?
0.0	0.0881162010417	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.699263062497	I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment.
0.0	0.356387034073	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.244186207294	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.196162388719	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.156645909858	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.50960560743	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.278917941702	What is the best way to do it?
0.0	0.378541200025	It's become more complicated.
0.0	0.203034236103	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.0983933219495	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.41519710983	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.159047229213	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
0.0	0.610468657903	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.364788563706	It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
0.0	0.248174040749	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.488890903771	Some of the bravest people that I had the privilege of working with as secretary of state were our development professionals who went sometimes alone, sometimes with our military, into very dangerous places in Iraq, in Afghanistan, elsewhere.
0.0	0.25218430828	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.517203367083	But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.
0.0	0.150910924774	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.0778082230501	Because we don't want them in and out -- we don't want them in and out of the prisons.
0.0	0.871627608623	We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations.
0.0	0.362160456378	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.218106245792	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.0409949587653	It's not great again.
0.0	0.677569272565	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...
0.0	0.342271652537	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.285381417673	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.367144406278	That is our government today.
0.0	0.64001333125	He's been a negative force.
0.0	0.310564769961	It cannot solely be America's fight.
0.0	0.684903888785	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.438151361336	Number one...
0.0	0.169032914915	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.319593240488	We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it.
0.0	0.237244708908	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.165450780263	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.

0.0	0.0789156187606	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.171409394175	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.201729206973	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.

1.0	0.478778832881	According to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.

0.0	0.298413563376	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.144556317732	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.094498532955	We've got the consensus, what we're lacking is political leadership...

0.0	0.265125406575	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.0980787281446	Let me just -- just say this.

0.0	0.1728972219	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.137189676368	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.0261207107953	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.318340998631	But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.
0.0	0.0941543040947	Folks, it's not too late.
0.0	0.272746689185	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.0940007583962	Can we stop?
0.0	0.1514646107	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
1.0	0.444361010011	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.0502439919591	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.294040944208	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.225451959485	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.

0.0	0.489814257526	I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done.
0.0	0.0939224278925	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.211228925017	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
0.0	0.0811909696329	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.216385242226	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.577499977792	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.847569052068	It'll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there's no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.
0.0	0.312461464917	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.2470426229	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.35298200792	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.0250175572954	It's not going to happen tomorrow.

0.0	0.449866635245	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.24548919853	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.218889591241	And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.
0.0	0.0738247676603	Good at email.
0.0	0.393950455402	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.400889713126	How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years.
0.0	0.389704196961	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.43160723747	... funding to them.
0.0	0.309897178479	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.0382923500099	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.142499310773	We have people that don't have it.
0.0	0.0829533529845	...before I go.
0.0	0.102729590159	Absolutely.
0.0	0.613634427828	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.322691980032	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.382696849734	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.10703756663	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.299669351387	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.0279727370707	I don't like that.
0.0	0.301912788653	ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.
0.0	0.153840914279	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.133038535312	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.10260420047	Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."
0.0	0.0565932331531	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.679972019739	Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.0792106072997	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.183355143914	No.
0.0	0.379412505301	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.
0.0	0.0191031261593	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.421512184648	No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.
1.0	0.958109066585	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.296271738966	We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up.

0.0	0.0370091362618	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.507630445338	And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details.
0.0	0.266832638088	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.9505828217	It costs me $3.
0.0	0.112884734309	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.0926990852142	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.
0.0	0.475196522174	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.137194673125	And we need the right people.
0.0	0.462365170023	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.163688539027	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.227901366667	And now many of these candidates want to cut it.
0.0	0.346767921159	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.128868973685	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.159387723203	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
1.0	0.208874090457	Well, John, look, I think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis to leave by 2011, is that an Iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend Iraq.
0.0	0.252249623434	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.163106936978	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.1898454883	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.167977903615	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.941829923582	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.19127233863	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.41225635323	In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, "Donald, you don't have enough borrowings.
0.0	0.215352888833	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.437912912054	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
1.0	0.245881221953	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.146054150979	How does that help us?  TRUMP R 15 94 1 N Where is that good?
0.0	0.342299681421	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.124341765148	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.505768836874	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.569513099109	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.297652817908	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.342669774134	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.348981384513	I've had had two town halls, one in Keene, one in Laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do.
0.0	0.202720697884	I said, "They send it back?"
0.0	0.0531188746593	But here's what's going to happen:
0.0	0.0666905436174	So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has.
0.0	0.509913069017	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.379214739411	It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.
1.0	0.996362043032	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.387605532527	Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country.
0.0	0.329314703859	I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college.
0.0	0.115456401745	I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.
0.0	0.109560824927	We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.
0.0	0.0189377376032	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.187647510369	But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.239405568596	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.0168500009093	We can't.
0.0	0.195874273935	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.208327304348	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.1834174088	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.221747781749	Well, you've got to be on top of it right away.
0.0	0.131470324218	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.281318961632	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.844859311505	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.333856371631	It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
0.0	0.0630394774912	And I watch the speeches.
0.0	0.249192649768	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.107055891018	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
0.0	0.200568481691	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.
0.0	0.198353320463	So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.
0.0	0.625860934055	But bottom line now, is in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or her family.
1.0	0.801025488469	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
1.0	0.856411248462	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.162771539869	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.349673452688	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.
0.0	0.0956900774865	Find out what I said to Greenspan.
0.0	0.0530702534836	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.231397881419	So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.
0.0	0.0962101375329	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.
0.0	0.490220660938	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.52024961472	Never support.
0.0	0.343124046385	Mark my words.
0.0	0.0392180171768	All right.
0.0	0.0856083111393	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.114511354569	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.35411795799	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.370235195772	But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
0.0	0.295965906977	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.89125961339	Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day.
0.0	0.0285451214334	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.440702810942	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
0.0	0.0753687981593	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.0472631978909	I'm the only person...
0.0	0.453197189822	Everybody's for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.0589772488323	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
0.0	0.302162332171	And we should be a welcoming nation.
0.0	0.431737964347	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.118149163454	And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage.
0.0	0.0531972643657	And for good cause.
0.0	0.179524594681	Well, thanks for having me.
0.0	0.459090066571	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.188488496066	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.
0.0	0.258711378394	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.131672608894	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.
0.0	0.215190745766	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.131685172838	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.0571645521059	I really am.
0.0	0.527764396088	The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans.
0.0	0.758451812018	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.172100289783	I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.
0.0	0.620990629301	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.506449022883	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.658858716362	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.228539004159	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.
0.0	0.0276805231697	It sounds crass.
0.0	0.688544980026	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.183355143914	You did.
0.0	0.183355143914	This is 2016.
0.0	0.0376144881501	I don't care.
0.0	0.0655377259812	We know...
0.0	0.248831070348	I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures.
0.0	0.339195507282	The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
0.0	0.388604474955	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.961633914967	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
1.0	0.337734182283	They just built a hotel in Syria.
0.0	0.417572596573	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
0.0	0.19666714734	And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition.
0.0	0.175042263511	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
0.0	0.11770335731	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.536113905774	We can have debt-free college in the United States.
0.0	0.742903011258	And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.
0.0	0.417836054291	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.1209315065	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.
0.0	0.0157221838013	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.377922100723	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.103596155237	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.336384945824	And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.
0.0	0.252382461959	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.253905290738	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.0557371381559	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.0927430837135	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.166660069421	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.395197361443	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.334647907303	And it's impossible for our people here to compete.
0.0	0.445666954656	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.736502019031	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.320912590581	We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be -- and -- and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody.
0.0	0.980512150135	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.104473960724	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.132098558409	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.396590542637	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.140724394759	I'm running for president, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people.
0.0	0.183222673586	The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.
0.0	0.0820795165276	Everybody thought it was a done deal.
0.0	0.0280247719517	OK?
0.0	0.47927685733	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.0421920210359	We don't know anything about that.
0.0	0.080353626463	That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.
0.0	0.140720976536	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.281701341298	I...
0.0	0.64588479742	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.0783659861336	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.298535334822	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.281392407354	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.0632122805648	Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.
0.0	0.17171143646	I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path.
0.0	0.102811523215	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.165653427608	That's the difference, and that's the kind of leader we need in the White House.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.171824464414	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.161216430257	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.335193062724	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.157905529721	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.0532282895684	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.194590282415	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.112224598212	You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.
0.0	0.21936725459	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.145990637043	I can do that.
0.0	0.732934066012	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.253349430371	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.146875835395	David, I am the very first...
0.0	0.30363375955	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.0718090180646	... Well, no, no.
0.0	0.0780245167236	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.688914010186	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.191579397488	We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists.
0.0	0.183355143914	Why is that?
0.0	0.0210652363398	That's what really matters.
0.0	0.285366059195	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.312956342755	On two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago.
0.0	0.376929958797	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.952162270155	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.183321015274	Yes.
0.0	0.262937360543	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.107405155264	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.0831446238685	Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.
0.0	0.443964020808	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.464728529849	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
1.0	0.940962674668	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.573641906315	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.519907400428	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.355166530156	That is a pledge that I'm making.
0.0	0.0914164501036	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.909435034927	Of course.
0.0	0.274510537358	But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.
0.0	0.281700724307	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.0465292685572	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.017854107179	Please go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.0451231812789	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.0850979629178	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.258196103368	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.190716492969	Ninety-three hours.
0.0	0.0493640744446	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.0703292451354	Don't believe it.
0.0	0.113601020632	David, thank you.
0.0	0.362099605024	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
1.0	0.857648253673	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.31638026133	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.120771601944	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.198849385251	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.254433556882	At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida.
0.0	0.403212380538	Nobody.
0.0	0.113202356023	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.302327739286	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.442637446939	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.518292616124	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.182404222969	...No, sir...
0.0	0.0517543521974	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.00596898952639	I agree with them.
0.0	0.182964841656	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
1.0	0.963244202079	Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.
0.0	0.51963113448	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
0.0	0.064714808627	Jared (ph), Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family.
0.0	0.644656314345	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.237796860609	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.454206268896	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.35126350403	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.178874715851	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.312390559193	You can go to my website...
0.0	0.278006629437	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.293957002126	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
0.0	0.107693446149	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.032727316752	I don't think it's gonna happen.
0.0	0.21509039812	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.15015325557	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.170048475336	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.
0.0	0.949591234298	We end up paying the highest prices in the world.
0.0	0.10242645439	Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.

0.0	0.690363135214	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.456050774048	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.395081173299	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.359672563726	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.

0.0	0.152081945337	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.212293787665	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.171576150977	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.33180930408	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy.

0.0	0.724202748249	Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.
0.0	0.431595015242	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.14088835331	Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title.
1.0	0.957728544291	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.

0.0	0.113699136895	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.485925986073	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.875033949421	By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started.
0.0	0.394801418748	We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress, but it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us.
0.0	0.277920456633	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.332677088668	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.
0.0	0.492026972196	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.364686393374	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.0593350918887	They blow people up.
0.0	0.0495519266196	We saw a dictator overthrown.

0.0	0.345061418326	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
0.0	0.148217472226	I think this is a very difficult issue.
0.0	0.530946512608	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.

0.0	0.397042002103	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.145990637043	I can.
0.0	0.0999572635759	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.0839091580162	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.0978628137246	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.118268809084	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.95660533396	You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent.
0.0	0.169446630966	She said the truth.
0.0	0.0418265806271	I have a wonderful family.
0.0	0.181948075742	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.527873164445	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.38936209123	Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, "Rand, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.145019304807	Can I just say this...
0.0	0.241264710363	So -- because we got to make the country rich.
0.0	0.887501455418	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.250309721543	She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.257536885296	Our country has tremendous potential.
0.0	0.221443174734	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.181480951908	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.120909555236	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.251330807554	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.985820288417	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.938098098468	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.0704489638868	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.251106518683	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.183355143914	...
0.0	0.44998851178	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.281701341298	But I...
0.0	0.220140229138	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.537319380713	There is broad consensus, 92 percent in the most recently poll of Americans want gun safety measures...
0.0	0.177943533369	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.240147169911	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.143735282086	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.212980067047	Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks -- between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance.
0.0	0.0673674050457	What about hydroelectric power?
0.0	0.315392093315	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.0508801934905	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.186350872228	Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values.
0.0	0.365665540503	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.226464423413	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.
0.0	0.0402269089071	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.232099119161	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.187546702632	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.35012005189	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.383974095482	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.456030106781	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.0969996526634	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.379983104707	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.21769975807	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.350484798932	Well, I think it's perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid.
0.0	0.192965303663	Border security has always been a part of that debate.
0.0	0.395643788343	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.147847134862	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.24214801551	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.131160751851	And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.
0.0	0.282082701085	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.154568780592	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.318861670554	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.00322422783382	Those are your enemies.
0.0	0.823401232447	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.524077191983	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.101551096029	Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted.
0.0	0.195961603886	Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.
0.0	0.103819398086	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.
0.0	0.0392180171768	All right.
0.0	0.724629101056	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.155973146226	A military island.
0.0	0.821721102344	As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.0822810039992	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.428299144777	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.908666177962	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.1417505959	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.149727198779	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.0758171950166	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.210288178691	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.633737204134	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
0.0	0.194000262438	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.642992662793	Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.
0.0	0.229557738144	I guess the one I -- I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after Bin Laden.
0.0	0.0152093082076	Looking forward to it.
0.0	0.309127700126	So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.
0.0	0.423350612754	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.166560312121	I was there in '89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.
0.0	0.1070516765	People say, "Oh, you don't like China?"
0.0	0.0442265269219	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.175828934806	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.231408018564	... against Islam -- radical Islam -- if you're not for border security.
0.0	0.0889370813909	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.291980979427	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.189813067059	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.107985106258	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?
0.0	0.0418413351288	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.
0.0	0.346634017795	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.185706421122	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.759204578646	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.550578583213	We are a better country than this.
0.0	0.200507806609	And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process.
0.0	0.0693560557603	But you don't hear that from anybody else.
0.0	0.264342240999	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.678798920509	To tell Qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep.
0.0	0.375109156554	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.144021292883	I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart.
0.0	0.0621042513757	We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.
0.0	0.460572156987	Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?
0.0	0.357656936086	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.0392180171768	Right.
0.0	0.133711994066	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.380038237705	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.177159742022	We bailed out Wall Street.
0.0	0.306200684163	We got it done in my state by leading with principal and that's what we need to do as a party for comprehensive gun safety.
0.0	0.346931760889	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.
0.0	0.309607701563	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.0392180171768	She was right.
0.0	0.312090035482	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.236527168853	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.132814890023	By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job.
0.0	0.0427560886877	We need that thinking.
0.0	0.12266634249	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.660520532614	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.318069570405	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.196285181318	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
1.0	0.992441113487	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
0.0	0.415600636941	and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States.
0.0	0.160836442733	And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China.
0.0	0.266103497644	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.162486592338	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.167297239044	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
1.0	0.850433018188	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
1.0	0.865976177223	In fact, wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century, after my husband's administration.
0.0	0.376633459253	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
0.0	0.0392180171768	That's not right.
1.0	0.593133342853	In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.
0.0	0.185893311137	But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
0.0	0.121189083163	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.0884243906252	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
1.0	0.999990643119	And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money.
0.0	0.0516481072049	Thank you, Marco.
0.0	0.949028083119	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.0828219471855	That can be done.
1.0	0.368176393422	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.0392180171768	All right.
0.0	0.0669175493592	They can't lead us.
0.0	0.0964126650561	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.33241905368	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.274468316372	White people?
0.0	0.0553184023108	You just want to...
0.0	0.648367340095	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.235691650243	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.35703280499	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.281570056721	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
1.0	0.46859611687	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.256920816248	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.129967826667	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.0418617655711	We listen to you and -- and then we act.
0.0	0.986756786975	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.250805541391	They've got nothing but money.
0.0	0.106289335865	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.0688376794866	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.0907413514515	I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work.
0.0	0.0555015918412	There are thing that can be done.
0.0	0.537904930243	And it will have effects in the private market.
0.0	0.518073847005	So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.
1.0	0.933971407368	And I have assets -- big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected -- 9 billion 240 million dollars.
0.0	0.18302627763	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.
0.0	0.243105212689	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.00894659045934	No, they shouldn't.
0.0	0.308886562621	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.401440806135	Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.
0.0	0.183355143914	...
0.0	0.079053823612	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.0473640914401	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.097459942436	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.
0.0	0.230680599681	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.253130793645	I said, "how's it going?"
0.0	0.914738757332	Trillions of dollars have gone from the middle class and working families to the top one-tenth of one percent who have doubled the percentage of wealth they now own.
0.0	0.5	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.226723910785	We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations.
0.0	0.197591421108	But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.
0.0	0.633715368033	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.183321015274	Yes.
0.0	0.281853394681	I know that because I buy the product."
0.0	0.174546604259	My wife, Jane, has been -- way back when before I knew her, a foster parent.
0.0	0.0741146789016	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
1.0	0.979607598698	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.280409405965	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.279667514815	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.159161179139	And, you know, I don't know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done.
0.0	0.427603802175	It's real estate.
0.0	0.227704585331	In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill, "Well I assume Hillary has told you about this."
0.0	0.291420336242	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.238354120367	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.287641556197	What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria, when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family you'd better get out now.
0.0	0.191480248899	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.203892348028	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.154422584378	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.197329454787	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
1.0	0.991847581257	This small country has welcomed in many refugees.
0.0	0.408079250441	But it was also the cascading effects that followed that.
0.0	0.221658268763	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.570099330787	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.0766532131117	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.0233268087004	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.270799141263	At the end of the day, if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities.
0.0	0.27862484049	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.996954514211	...income tax...
0.0	0.682771774305	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.184903367689	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.124374142797	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.0020491969428	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.556470345641	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.302049522226	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.0403110100925	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.399793644451	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.183355143914	...
0.0	0.547403522162	And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity.
0.0	0.178165414889	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.266143004359	We went after those who had attacked us.
0.0	0.235789055041	First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.
0.0	0.447988494395	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.662182772452	No hour is too short, no dollar too small.
0.0	0.377478467173	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.193081650137	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.430607022813	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.610200564445	What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.320427108259	I've done an amazing job.
0.0	0.186638251463	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.856066151347	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.48328647006	Support community banks and credit unions.
0.0	0.318266158621	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.739876892439	That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
0.0	0.782265663915	And I applaud his record in Maryland.
0.0	0.016777823958	I think that is...
0.0	0.174151652039	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.13343940521	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.294976622284	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.167404886644	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.112498365802	this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.
0.0	0.129626942392	Now, what the magic number is, I don't know, because we don't know the extent of the problem.
0.0	0.183355143914	No.
0.0	0.0272126801713	I think there is a consensus.
1.0	0.782868091117	And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
0.0	0.227829200361	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.0491382827176	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.346760163574	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.14073423433	And I said, "I know.
0.0	0.103602754739	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.244822088701	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.346767646748	If they want to accept our values and our laws.
0.0	0.178911426663	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.272211190598	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.432649548211	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.0790518910979	So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.
0.0	0.120608951402	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.281378294021	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.0991828048189	Yeah.
0.0	0.0343707393818	That makes no sense at all.
0.0	0.305379859591	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.104333565923	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
0.0	0.0990484942083	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.909435034927	Of course not.
0.0	0.0822551979622	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.256055172661	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.19135428064	Yes, it's very simple.
1.0	0.131405249969	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.284953779067	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.
0.0	0.152803879592	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.234691550685	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.552149304217	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.0725115241247	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.368708721347	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.
0.0	0.157918099898	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
0.0	0.130092959569	John?
0.0	0.358706550134	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.105390052065	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.251849617646	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.468279250396	That's true.
0.0	0.359159645293	It's one of 15 strategic goals I've set out to make our country a better place by cutting these sort of deaths in half in the next five years.
0.0	0.038772367005	And it isn't because I'm all that great.
0.0	0.190177917477	We got nothing but problems.
0.0	0.741688424222	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.525722420354	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.523252513315	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.0600316601633	They don't know how to bring it about.
0.0	0.0732480938973	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.876124605652	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.1717275257	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.0681738332211	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.941089160058	We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
0.0	0.124893078767	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.0898222016682	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.

0.0	0.159625385837	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.919646309993	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.248341942007	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.333606948242	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.

0.0	0.0894636499775	But I would say this to you, Bret.
0.0	0.302165598625	In the 1980s, it was in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Reagan's administration, and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel, and others were murdered.
0.0	0.102423346071	They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it.
0.0	0.555903423376	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.396493103418	We have to end -- education has to be local.
0.0	0.240046920509	It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.
0.0	0.339442238727	But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.126652046483	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.282662916881	I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out.
0.0	0.109338266533	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.

0.0	0.135249568033	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
1.0	0.999999763252	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.160286613823	I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.
0.0	0.0413403425131	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.

0.0	0.0617956464107	(LAUGHTER)

0.0	0.110019863342	No, the new planes.

0.0	0.239763289054	Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.
0.0	0.679687746661	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.451918641186	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.520427320571	In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, "what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"
0.0	0.282148173097	... we will secure the border...

0.0	0.0707170276299	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.0927490188351	And we have nothing.
0.0	0.105683419111	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.567737036983	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.342011908631	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.236022526285	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.153088945771	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?

0.0	0.475291936685	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.145706692125	What would we do if this were ebola?
0.0	0.796194463851	I want this bill to be voted down.

0.0	0.596386889335	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.206757456441	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.716140194107	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.
0.0	0.372129435152	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.20001289467	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.

0.0	0.254243435563	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.218726693684	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.318535390811	First of all...
0.0	0.25398668846	That's a drag on the economy.
0.0	0.708488743307	That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.
0.0	0.139109347109	Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting...
0.0	0.0703292451354	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.0960871955012	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.

0.0	0.18278874934	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.16773071278	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.782104819779	There is no money in the Social Security account.

0.0	0.167728881519	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.282359642252	And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young, old, everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard.
0.0	0.750395119313	But accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000.
0.0	0.134106064025	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.9418323819	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.060159037391	You really can't.
0.0	0.181104856472	That's the job.
0.0	0.096232793771	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.407159103768	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.870693218283	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.244148402599	I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third.
0.0	0.356875738975	When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
0.0	0.342373569988	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.0726282125955	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.476581205279	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.369317762751	As Americans, we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet, but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies, to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability.
0.0	0.207563705587	The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.

0.0	0.313342808465	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.986500944803	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.38929910559	It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.
0.0	0.221957162751	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.
0.0	0.113039521076	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.181936065916	And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.
0.0	0.408662204215	The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.
0.0	0.183355143914	So...
0.0	0.183355143914	No.
0.0	0.170342409068	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.0180644475987	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.232773070829	Two weeks later, the place was blown up.
0.0	0.23132366597	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.0254304622943	it won't happen.
0.0	0.634430421217	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.486754210348	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.207253243924	You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that.
0.0	0.104437782828	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.45362568401	And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.
0.0	0.283365897962	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.0961235223699	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.133766483927	Well, I think it's pretty clear that they know that I will.
0.0	0.294711383473	Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens.
0.0	0.306082195906	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.207743068564	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.355212792019	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.278793113932	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.0555072342004	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.0680365382874	Came out great.
0.0	0.402607040184	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.446730999166	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.306407997939	ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.
0.0	0.564840937249	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.140347351494	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.359568672298	I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.191741367801	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.123577967523	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.400225031827	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.0903683978756	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.541910742546	They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.
0.0	0.186105542092	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.30403076803	And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq.
1.0	0.99999824339	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.

0.0	0.00853131612121	Talk about what?
0.0	0.0953831726131	I gotta do it, Dad.
1.0	0.874364515414	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
0.0	0.0346874829858	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.196142075334	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.346742795453	to save a company.
0.0	0.115599973388	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.626723791421	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.468279250396	That's not true.
0.0	0.139553731218	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.225607402965	I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible.
1.0	0.991465641991	What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons.
0.0	0.163285742339	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.56409324264	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.24323358414	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.0332210793124	We don't want to be Sweden.
0.0	0.0614164760172	Oh.
1.0	0.990789370162	In 1988, just to set the record straight governor, I ran for the U.S. House.
0.0	0.0548097261116	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.851681619324	We raised the minimum wage.
0.0	0.262996656738	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.100464129709	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.358090374251	Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago.
0.0	0.528861248121	But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.
0.0	0.176450109335	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
0.0	0.230014082205	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.069594881375	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.761703383083	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.0622706135138	He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, "No interest."
0.0	0.0871599785565	You're right.
0.0	0.0691394530811	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.0752897485367	You know, this is not easy work.
0.0	0.0194785171565	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.158155690474	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.603915821851	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.143771481218	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.268987505121	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.13359636609	And I do not believe it's a good idea now.
0.0	0.288555171494	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.444555348413	Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it.
0.0	0.0524463245593	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.162302084903	We ought to send used equipment, right?
0.0	0.1520941093	They sweated like dogs.
0.0	0.201220769695	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
0.0	0.286710414413	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.0655377259812	So you know what?
0.0	0.350476411973	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.129526045054	And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you're a governor.
0.0	0.365957775284	I saw Ted Cruz say, "we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill."
0.0	0.178282923227	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.364296157806	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.850790528365	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.362395093779	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.189169311814	They're not so stupid.
0.0	0.701814866035	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.642714434228	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.11560286467	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
1.0	0.941515973106	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.183321015274	Yes.
0.0	0.193014093114	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.63015695852	I do not support amnesty...
1.0	0.994707928951	ISIL videos, ISIL training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in America is at a gun show.
0.0	0.364207853677	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.20006635859	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.154725732662	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.417166777961	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.194455240313	Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.344999202529	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.293729015298	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.474570651345	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.37788361	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
1.0	0.924408337396	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.392900622116	They are our first line of defense.
0.0	0.183355143914	No.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.0659677491962	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.164132855044	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.680196663664	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.
0.0	0.272298857214	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.292738429826	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.183227609398	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.355093862044	And it requires an entire world to come together, including in a very active way, the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.299718903406	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.192550321991	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.
0.0	0.828088395956	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.244864729037	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.174908628027	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.44732786515	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.5	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.219924991595	The CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary.
0.0	0.12526224917	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.0194651084314	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.350362993581	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.469428882522	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.101334027711	Please reconsider, I'll say no.
0.0	0.152702724324	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.0693011634693	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.107030561581	I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.
0.0	0.0888953947362	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.126561654242	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.

0.0	0.268072377965	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.349813088078	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.343850631867	He said, "Yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam.

0.0	0.078644524027	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.417790137745	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.0853439161115	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.716632347685	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.709006573834	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.17754549742	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.212551825394	And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it.
0.0	0.583555912095	What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security, through the State Department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening.
0.0	0.0750299558898	I think I'm actually a very nice person."
0.0	0.0638390507418	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.152523479108	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.419266497306	The United States has, unfortunately, been victimized by terrorism going back decades.
0.0	0.0818708113615	It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino.
0.0	0.0696316681481	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.135335607871	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.182260865803	We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation.
0.0	0.17029489902	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.04705333831	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.749809056668	I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation.
0.0	0.127292675592	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.0836024291977	And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
0.0	0.16113484731	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.321203660028	This is not a conflict where we send in the third divisions of Marines.

0.0	0.884792872135	He has never defended...
0.0	0.149303283542	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.0358062832483	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.337486237803	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.214180708537	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.253844710184	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.0115306279895	Sorry.
0.0	0.122397857023	That's really nice.
0.0	0.140920315664	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.125721378721	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.347655852165	Not only -- not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton -- and I hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- I want to apologize to my supporters.
0.0	0.086620125331	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.0987740106222	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.0085406905203	He's very smooth.
0.0	0.0611610419107	But not for us.
0.0	0.483885367879	For over 200 years, America's light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again.
0.0	0.10184086825	... and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.286916979849	And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.
0.0	0.515049644552	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.0332739118803	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.388785219721	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.369854693943	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.639378236432	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.24754267719	Many are in this building.
0.0	0.104283226441	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.141094415906	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.183355143914	No.
0.0	0.140392911901	It's not just Wall Street.
0.0	0.00731892203456	I feel like...
0.0	0.171669064328	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.955005071061	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.0669834108692	And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.
0.0	0.125460172674	And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.
0.0	0.607395397135	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.334564955832	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.0759666921951	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.139744067544	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.571920280067	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.163526839308	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.449376792126	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
0.0	0.140797144599	Parents, and sons, and daughters and family members, and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them, we must remember this, that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century.
0.0	0.438000571067	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.265739149438	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.212189574496	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.379832268426	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.06137122826	We did a lot to help.
0.0	0.108383795253	But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here.
0.0	0.150793410155	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.0114763339254	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.0583116051541	But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.183410246559	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.291066674054	What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years.
0.0	0.178240961494	And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.
0.0	0.0715877092841	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.109517025029	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.328509924491	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.134492801217	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.216690106212	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.44704914662	I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war.
0.0	0.707779343352	I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border."
0.0	0.0235189901965	Then I looked at Rubio.
0.0	0.159714367052	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.0497657024172	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.434825860564	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.899585480792	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.128599637635	And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.
0.0	0.055755550228	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.394112833107	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.349069236962	Now, I understand that this is very difficult.
0.0	0.0914905924572	And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem.
0.0	0.105743835104	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.25932801915	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.01361535872	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.0841533398755	I will work my heart out.
0.0	0.160053493361	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.423801269954	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.233550538674	We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground."
0.0	0.239085654439	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.0964304243404	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.341735436587	And let me, by the way, take this moment to congratulate Hillary Clinton, who I thought not only did an outstanding job as our first lady, but redefined what that role could be.
0.0	0.0541579163568	And they're all over the place.
1.0	0.557016207986	But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.
0.0	0.130059840659	People who we should be welcoming and working with.
0.0	0.731947963649	And I opposed it.
0.0	0.310982283818	I think that is the number one requirement.
0.0	0.687763736149	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.458232376937	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.194541157348	Planned Parenthood will be defunded.
0.0	0.403878262316	And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.
0.0	0.283262015369	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.338850383436	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.392184945451	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
1.0	0.382207072256	We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.517761412817	She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.0720610881559	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.0735950550864	And it's an honor to have everybody here.
0.0	0.446193289316	But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired.
0.0	0.17920144472	And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.
0.0	0.468279250396	It's not true.
0.0	0.647125390691	We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
0.0	0.279741930098	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
0.0	0.200161419749	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.472985406565	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.0681220359676	Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process.
0.0	0.470222556926	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.183384307558	We have one House member from Vermont, three candidates in the race.
0.0	0.0655159054368	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.411437584813	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.24618170136	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.0579284615744	But look, we didn't know what was happening next.
0.0	0.646009688731	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.183355143914	2,000?
0.0	0.336785659483	Let's get rid of Assad later.
0.0	0.183355143914	But...
0.0	0.162605698452	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.11314832753	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.41899245269	I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses.
0.0	0.0949081653129	We can't even go there.
0.0	0.734959430901	According to the economists -- who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying -- that $24 trillion -- we're very close -- that's the point of no return.
0.0	0.122826868735	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.44393257562	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.722160254204	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.0726821560771	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.145787748919	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.126355392876	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.641630650382	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.4756824856	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.0280247719517	OK.
1.0	0.493745894382	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.135437519201	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.402460530018	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.362390222273	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.32023591396	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.0409798970896	Let me...
0.0	0.183355143914	...
0.0	0.044294124528	That is why we need to make...
0.0	0.0974521757399	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.133094930654	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.26872958832	After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the -- the donors and by the lobbyists -- and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero -- I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford.
0.0	0.254087826931	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.130011362969	I don't think anyone has a magical solution.
0.0	0.548506112789	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.918246319997	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.0722126587276	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.125781851744	And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.
0.0	0.231191788223	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.10410987194	Chris...
0.0	0.361720040986	The United States must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.0812223501295	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.406620349598	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.115603462379	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.266470737118	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.
0.0	0.114487168449	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
1.0	0.118849746354	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.911620482936	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.0321237226421	That's for sure.
0.0	0.341416701028	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.290347185064	But actually I am.
0.0	0.157300442438	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.0602385752738	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.258312402693	... and I think -- you know, Governor -- Jeb, you -- the attack that -- the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS.
0.0	0.262073156523	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
1.0	0.999998910211	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.162319535833	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
0.0	0.956856514361	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
0.0	0.418408318258	We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force.
0.0	0.575412709286	I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
0.0	0.165557636375	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.227790039422	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.558391641907	You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks.
0.0	0.175879741407	You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying.
0.0	0.136406646645	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.60900829531	But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
0.0	0.482060688256	Social Security, which Republicans call a Ponzi scheme, may face privatization.
0.0	0.289053343104	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.0168500009093	They can't.
0.0	0.0321237226421	He sure did.
0.0	0.84397844434	Seventy percent of our population lives bi-coastally).
0.0	0.347209137454	So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.
0.0	0.283841165324	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.161533198354	In all due respect...
0.0	0.161171935446	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.388740970325	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.0667097954139	May I respond?
0.0	0.28970783755	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.264781726307	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.187146702977	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.
0.0	0.182308140877	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.318508590945	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.0168500009093	I can't do it.
0.0	0.343219502802	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.779641383118	And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.
0.0	0.477998065808	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.974011547935	You once had a pension.

0.0	0.617564249323	And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.
0.0	0.121055685468	That I can tell you.
0.0	0.344693900495	And they came back with 23 recommendations.

0.0	0.150444882039	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.183355143914	What do we do?
0.0	0.0792582872382	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.00269773494444	It's a disaster.
0.0	0.318535390811	... first of all...
0.0	0.0520047390746	Judgment matters as well.

0.0	0.309616104792	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.271037135216	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.201004902528	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
1.0	0.793858610855	Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof.
0.0	0.368088459308	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.104291923594	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.202992574576	You do the arithmetic.

0.0	0.0568223434063	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.83979220641	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.318535390811	First of all...
0.0	0.125662372408	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.0333696218372	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.22413139997	Well, I just think you're asking a question with a false choice.
0.0	0.117260025469	And it's just not going to work.
0.0	0.39837705661	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.0511241811437	That is an egregious act.
0.0	0.0942748576895	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.

0.0	0.160337319591	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.

0.0	0.544482320851	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.145990637043	We can do that.
0.0	0.10170490783	Well, let's take it one at a time.
0.0	0.129129679441	I learned so much.

0.0	0.090073516336	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.0557371381559	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.106583618393	That's fine.
0.0	0.724095345909	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.351619133293	Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors.
0.0	0.385660345605	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.109799933082	Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire.
0.0	0.294647546704	They can provide resources.
0.0	0.168981058089	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.0729297137954	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.601481228982	And I wrote a book about this called Immigration Wars.
0.0	0.186304768844	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.0386257491076	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.344217739223	We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.
0.0	0.156451617036	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.0655377259812	We know about the Belgians.
0.0	0.173131849348	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.343186151718	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.103099899367	And that's not what's happening now.
0.0	0.119708159043	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.435257281888	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.0640012205697	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.0863681175821	He is a good man.
1.0	0.947292399105	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.190004476369	Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.
0.0	0.175072625846	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.920107180439	Thousands.
0.0	0.0634991710525	You know, I've always had a great deal of respect.
0.0	0.0797921612368	They have to be alert to problems.
0.0	0.110833866646	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.255489835832	Ford.
0.0	0.386465495865	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.256686892978	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.26696041231	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.614804309	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.227173148763	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
0.0	0.119693794069	Two points.
0.0	0.0298014740483	A step forward.
0.0	0.551418334738	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.0466029607664	They have no choice.
0.0	0.38347218035	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.270772983913	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.520781321593	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.741688737219	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.162361149031	In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance.
0.0	0.171658111675	But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate.
0.0	0.307187506422	You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes.
0.0	0.484939430346	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.0841639573014	And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.
0.0	0.753418740788	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.148686185281	All right, Nancy, I really wish you'd come back to me on this on this one, John...
0.0	0.233161609331	This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.
0.0	0.545637987007	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.39163184009	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.716820994395	I am proud that I was the first member of Congress to take Americans over the Canadian border to buy breast cancer drugs for one-tenth the price they were paying in the United States.
0.0	0.735482631954	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.761122701896	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.150721701372	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.35744168542	Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
0.0	0.172665568468	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.0958651710102	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.405132877655	I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.
0.0	0.141605471165	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.122324452459	But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go.
0.0	0.197979386022	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.31607419364	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.124504682354	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.118022064283	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.
0.0	0.133151906046	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.128884666029	And it's-- it's a worthy debate.
0.0	0.227386111579	It's Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.
0.0	0.646634711415	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.259323110146	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.269938196025	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.296519708731	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
0.0	0.37244683827	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.263350815425	I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.
0.0	0.558621338931	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.102729590159	Absolutely.
0.0	0.170363251447	I'm tested.
0.0	0.0507073543148	He's a progressive economist.
0.0	0.0584939294444	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.193231283425	And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.
0.0	0.0779895506914	They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
0.0	0.217004029982	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.323282912327	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.131435741248	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.131440793694	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.392234540244	And I'll tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign.
0.0	0.25175641007	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.423504947734	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.183355143914	No.
0.0	0.105334805869	And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
0.0	0.130652044223	And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.
0.0	0.122497721415	I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.
1.0	0.999998135528	In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.
0.0	0.1063906403	And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...
0.0	0.143232171827	We've got to hate the Muslims."
0.0	0.238253312459	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.104458364434	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.123088279461	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.
0.0	0.314223606008	How the hell can you vote for this guy?
0.0	0.385475574404	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.0143052283388	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.374871382226	David, there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees.
0.0	0.0909704276274	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.10404481039	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.103701938914	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
0.0	0.543465247828	Of course the United States must lead.
0.0	0.22769062639	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.213431245587	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.934912867482	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.526321087716	We have no borders.
0.0	0.570427934383	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.180334075932	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.100691307592	He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
0.0	0.432336840033	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.259068575419	But this is what we also have to say.
0.0	0.0370647550164	They won't accept it.
1.0	0.537202149681	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.181499244838	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.183355143914	That's what he is.
0.0	0.62889295455	They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe.
0.0	0.572651638105	But the United States is not the policeman of the world.
0.0	0.16174898891	I said, "Is he intelligent?"
0.0	0.134128923154	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.376686971523	Dynamically.
0.0	0.207717250886	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.388184993869	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
1.0	0.999992598343	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.232512823985	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.034085175337	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.94238971285	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.067651355856	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.111836749372	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.0669468397808	That's who I'm indebted to.
0.0	0.0987182573813	But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up.
0.0	0.277060402003	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.287064301522	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.892747962396	To get deregulated -- listen to this, they spent $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions over a 10-year period.
0.0	0.226212883517	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.0392180171768	Right.
0.0	0.736543354939	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.193410331725	We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.
0.0	0.890466139575	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.331545284059	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.179215463809	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.611195538912	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.402107202865	It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.
0.0	0.256953877886	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.13603649674	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.278127420484	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.
0.0	0.27441416995	There must be some way.
0.0	0.41849023072	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.0289969474904	I love China.
0.0	0.108402865055	I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House.
0.0	0.170307936761	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.355447519699	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.145084461369	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.
0.0	0.295790161939	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.183355143914	But...
0.0	0.0343370369389	Does my family like me?
0.0	0.188351008915	Big difference.
0.0	0.141563880106	And some, I assume, are good people.
0.0	0.388368950573	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.185179631788	We have people that aren't smart.
0.0	0.299621722484	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.161629638601	They all want me to support them.
0.0	0.0991828048189	Yeah.
0.0	0.016777823958	I think what is...
0.0	0.0914603688104	They knew that.
0.0	0.275448313784	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.203078944985	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.187155465585	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.126800200262	But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.162210238897	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.92032907442	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.0427086019404	So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.
0.0	0.183355143914	She did.
0.0	0.0522115667886	Look, I served on...
0.0	0.273824957675	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.298501386885	When those buildings came down, she was trapped in her building and I didn't hear from her over six hours.
0.0	0.178410086305	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
0.0	0.569889760182	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.385417269017	And there is a lot we can do in college affordability.
0.0	0.0655377259812	I know.
0.0	0.232507360386	What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger.
0.0	0.257070284032	And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?
0.0	0.0712880657916	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.0537236124576	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.0861434162312	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.0241364016208	So did you, Marco.
0.0	0.234999589667	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.282444987211	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.287971183118	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.
0.0	0.0458384797559	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.158096181946	And, you know, I do think it's important to do exactly what Senator Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about, and that they talk to each of us about.
0.0	0.351070818852	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.118828077143	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.45812699237	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.0691335045347	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.0919735838177	I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
0.0	0.11289973258	I know the bad ones.
0.0	0.753167042475	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.151450708355	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.459614846666	Chris I was mentioned in that question.
0.0	0.255130670321	And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.
0.0	0.332209141792	They've advertised that.
0.0	0.21182523445	Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem.
0.0	0.289298064038	I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization.
0.0	0.442232427881	I -- you know, know that Senator Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers.
0.0	0.590943479478	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.358842011393	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.150251185877	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.0567406951428	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.159456791118	They kill us.
0.0	0.101855823895	... What was your question...
0.0	0.143000746868	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.927432051806	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.708439507612	But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it.
0.0	0.0675330876813	We have -- I don't know that there's any disagreement here...
0.0	0.150281601433	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.187388841112	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.260418007041	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.346150640022	I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department.
0.0	0.211899982929	The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world.
0.0	0.736773106546	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.0470792797402	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.23375072092	And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms.
0.0	0.0617509082813	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.202718778814	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.219564698094	And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.
0.0	0.10319271342	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.0565034734268	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.15369800498	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.196718612834	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.485187297306	But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.
0.0	0.562464530949	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.916256528664	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
0.0	0.277661690221	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.70050756574	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.0908247631078	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.
0.0	0.745786680551	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.260596235888	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.058411254686	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.0985771685977	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.208006730654	Terrorism in this country scares everyone.
0.0	0.444514195165	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.208647442556	And when he moved on his own people, threatening a massacre, genocide, the Europeans and the Arabs, our allies and partners, did ask for American help and we provided it.
0.0	0.240585125531	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.170665750554	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.14790976301	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.875736904991	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.258329883921	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...
0.0	0.0775292218669	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.135877149917	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.216757874321	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.142161351029	We've been at this a couple of years.
0.0	0.457081211612	And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.
0.0	0.117464665869	You learn that threats always change.
0.0	0.195497723302	Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild.
0.0	0.374234132508	They;re gone.
0.0	0.0972885156587	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.262397685309	People were shocked, Trump got it.
0.0	0.292285607465	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.221638653273	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.263491523352	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.102640262542	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.0608640284561	I have no idea.
0.0	0.117678002018	There's been no crowd like this.
0.0	0.15606074873	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.
0.0	0.231809429576	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.123293562528	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.25449237826	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.192430097309	There's too much -- it's like -- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
0.0	0.073634388899	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
1.0	0.989701097616	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.164979784047	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.166810620483	I am glad Donald is running.
0.0	0.772245838429	Number one, there are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in New Hampshire.
1.0	0.999999993026	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.678022553336	Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.
0.0	0.016777823958	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.0384675843425	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.652277401281	And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.
0.0	0.173818054108	So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
0.0	0.316854733594	And we have to stop all the divisions.
0.0	0.0769278784685	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.14981988818	If you want to make it into the middle class -- I'm not saying in all cases -- we need plumbers, and we need carpenters, and electricians, that's for sure, and they should get help as well.
0.0	0.853552752574	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.235099549764	And one of his little boys said to him, "Dad, what happens if Donald Trump wins and we have to move out of our homes?"
0.0	0.0935867313813	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.176336295384	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.586674585807	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.141507024553	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.057032109621	Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.
0.0	0.179354109633	Martha, we offered a lot more than they were willing to take.
0.0	0.285352231512	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.219839948999	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
0.0	0.183355143914	I have...
0.0	0.128546334303	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.152484487776	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.459245575024	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.137200907506	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.0789729368697	I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.
0.0	0.0944747473155	And we do have to form a coalition.
0.0	0.0844451487901	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.133668078929	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
0.0	0.536813494294	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.0464195103248	Martha, thank you.
0.0	0.193169165197	We know about the French.
0.0	0.183321015274	Yes.
0.0	0.244048918779	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.190296067818	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.121616904471	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...
0.0	0.552032923633	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
1.0	0.999994589958	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.252321694547	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.165022379928	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.089625745525	I said, "I don't know."
0.0	0.251324529265	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.261282863608	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.213962554959	And the world, no doubt is a better place without him.
0.0	0.71614983784	Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs.
0.0	0.127482714653	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.112322191167	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.180395122559	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.131232991486	We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.
0.0	0.0251609906949	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.0823462441395	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.307382874881	You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
0.0	0.27114357595	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.593912360994	This is absolutely absurd.
0.0	0.755138749283	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.02006649616	We're friends.
0.0	0.226522643998	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.873472782262	Bill.
0.0	0.607052949788	That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.
0.0	0.38499533641	But I have another one, Ford.
0.0	0.724465336182	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.0600462154989	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.518902089562	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.259752329162	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.299833392245	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
1.0	0.251448569462	When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.203227231241	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.580815371718	Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
0.0	0.1834174088	So, I thank you very much for that.
0.0	0.0879664799229	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.167022093664	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.42792714416	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.0365287418867	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.138486152284	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.28385165442	Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country -- we would never build in an ocean.
0.0	0.0671744859998	Let's keep going.
0.0	0.216052256395	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.111708561062	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.176745454057	I said no.
0.0	0.0732661909591	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
0.0	0.451481863056	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
1.0	0.989639444515	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.297345743615	Bigger than that?
0.0	0.945713953949	She voted for it.
0.0	0.149920738383	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.180265814736	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.401831513448	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.256474266973	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.175925693739	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.0280247719517	OK.
0.0	0.279577640143	We will -- when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice.
0.0	0.236802355257	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.
0.0	0.197014758479	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.14838218232	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
1.0	0.999998436902	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.13426289025	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.463596279025	We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we're not going to hand out citizenship cards, either.
0.0	0.223317930996	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.102729590159	Absolutely.
0.0	0.14926788713	I would just...
0.0	0.11381640445	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
0.0	0.440756155119	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.423665252586	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
1.0	0.993551904457	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
0.0	0.13359989776	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.555037753296	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
1.0	0.999999326515	Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.
0.0	0.333242344434	So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.
0.0	0.0999084269802	I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination.
0.0	0.641105843755	Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.522200817829	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.140565495738	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
0.0	0.259587576147	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.422660513555	At the same time we're doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform.
0.0	0.182999145812	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.0955065755887	They're killing us.
0.0	0.474339906832	Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone.
0.0	0.828499093294	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.183355143914	...
0.0	0.096243674495	Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate.
0.0	0.249907314288	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.258891426746	... First of all -- Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.106511868572	Well, there are so many, I don't know where to start.
0.0	0.177670272889	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.255162031674	The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.0881759202634	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.183410246559	The answer is no.
0.0	0.34839149922	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.208887936232	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.468060911364	They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.108594376493	Al Qaida was based in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.676818551301	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.115580635016	You can't hide behind parliamentary tricks.
0.0	0.01361535872	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.456301789968	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.430489009814	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
0.0	0.48419238709	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.178252108641	But I agree, as I mentioned a moment ago, with King Abdullah.
0.0	0.451918201889	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.408597322532	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.277453777789	So ladies and gentlemen...I am officially running...... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.
0.0	0.226695123547	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.
0.0	0.142452381367	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.479587737265	That's what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I'm proud that they're supporting my campaign.
0.0	0.485424161274	Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, who said my plan for what we should do to reign in Wall Street was more comprehensive and better.
0.0	0.169367465957	They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.
0.0	0.212577818445	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.468279250396	That's true.
0.0	0.0351381751334	I think he is right.
0.0	0.100091826282	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.315474154058	We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.
0.0	0.236927172288	I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.
0.0	0.143744622933	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.
0.0	0.395814918904	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.270145922144	Could we have your support?
0.0	0.493247650719	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.0991828048189	Yeah.
0.0	0.33124757995	Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.
0.0	0.104590225534	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.394574395305	I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
0.0	0.199480965832	Secondly, we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.
0.0	0.0478408870306	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.158007550917	Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face.
0.0	0.357429111919	Reinstating Glass- Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough.
0.0	0.222386263584	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
0.0	0.149081615029	They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there.
0.0	0.090034465381	And it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer.
0.0	0.441212721025	And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.
0.0	0.12747923078	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.160650373649	And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears.
0.0	0.363339221174	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.149553273367	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.428150911787	We have fought, as Democrats, for decades to get a health care plan.
0.0	0.142242166422	I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.172777790043	A few days ago a similar incident happened.
0.0	0.0422806227914	It can happen.
0.0	0.484819418083	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.320842009831	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
0.0	0.118044019261	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.172722142622	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.211189116824	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.475900609231	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.959772030887	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.406936303958	It's a country in which people choose to buy guns.
0.0	0.755111591087	The number of heroin deaths are growing very, very significantly.
0.0	0.12474139125	I think that what we're facing with ISIS is especially complicated.
0.0	0.383260231979	Because we need money.
0.0	0.212438281204	But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.
0.0	0.416391154157	When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.926022558484	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.959138296715	We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.
0.0	0.0822935787761	My oldest daughter's a teacher.
0.0	0.15654351322	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.228130884131	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.
0.0	0.89793386646	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.0881052619172	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.438549253402	But, bottom line is this is the year 2015.
0.0	0.139009227893	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.243171117668	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.198664681709	The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...
0.0	0.317257262296	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.170169263685	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.283199474219	I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.293143104647	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...
0.0	0.583138196788	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.0745938453552	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.805516211682	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.101933695247	He's wrong.
0.0	0.236776690737	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.887979191383	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.909310254253	Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent.
0.0	0.176127740761	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
0.0	0.261419804224	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.135032990696	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.0164474046681	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.268710962019	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.623468344597	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.726248159671	... people all over this country -- not you, Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other.
1.0	0.99477753452	And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.
0.0	0.675073535541	We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York.
0.0	0.061527678254	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.141567189414	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.269936121424	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.414655818891	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.415408881965	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.516667513083	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.
0.0	0.220308242003	I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security.
0.0	0.104967107516	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.729058954232	It means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana.
0.0	0.183355143914	I do.
0.0	0.400202827715	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.0283685736137	I will do that.
1.0	0.393683292183	They built a hotel.
0.0	0.573731213884	I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money.
0.0	0.0283685736137	They will not.
0.0	0.437821245007	Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.
0.0	0.262377355339	John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.
0.0	0.150886109163	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.162750359201	Not bad.
0.0	0.179137700707	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
0.0	0.0671834524798	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.139889589958	And we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.
0.0	0.143761878355	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.0148530586227	Thank you.
0.0	0.893580396168	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.

0.0	0.39125010793	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.

0.0	0.20536220471	You've got to be on top of it.

0.0	0.337718722179	The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.

0.0	0.0639162443137	I need your help.
0.0	0.479201865421	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.146248535851	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.928503736617	Who denies that it is crazy...
0.0	0.135126670582	Now I'm not doing that...I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?
0.0	0.273744656613	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.0767623266416	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.341400134627	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.350688924635	But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it.
0.0	0.1980845916	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.895237576894	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.4565830274	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.29298951506	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.0989166798416	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
1.0	0.988160649735	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.202109454756	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.830862566968	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.382057173178	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.
0.0	0.492526942247	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.116980926037	We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.
0.0	0.204720702849	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.551398950287	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.436397950619	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.28326204598	The first vote hasn't been counted.
0.0	0.0353800251201	It's not working.
0.0	0.669289445428	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.0292392612895	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.249814971301	They would like to rip it up and start all over again, throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now.
0.0	0.656094350331	And I apologize to nobody for that.
0.0	0.0950420590714	You know, Ted didn't show up.
0.0	0.23258635978	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.5524397262	It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English.
0.0	0.10815723917	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.00596898952639	I agree with that.
0.0	0.106903699926	Break them up.
0.0	0.120693628647	I'll give you another example.
0.0	0.290261625619	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.314312329965	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
0.0	0.157269167765	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.320989112639	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.448411740099	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.183355143914	No, I have not.
0.0	0.551637388277	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.0373533343939	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.157996021681	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.106457528752	That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.
0.0	0.0470109758507	So, so important.
0.0	0.295541913649	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.065945059996	I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.010058125358	It's not crass.
0.0	0.419705117047	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.101686028047	Let me give you the bad news.
0.0	0.512276811456	Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS.
0.0	0.276341761232	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.0392180171768	Right.
0.0	0.147252022438	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.5	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.
0.0	0.264070600072	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.929776778016	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.890581445621	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.217030129458	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.863004195701	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.143779602667	It's making...
0.0	0.162007388164	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.476505913497	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.696282938719	This country is changing.
0.0	0.114898475597	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
1.0	0.959564836895	And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
0.0	0.222768286608	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.239921534138	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.

0.0	0.365979092237	They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.
0.0	0.160234418258	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.254528830505	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.168700379905	And that's what we have= representing us.
0.0	0.04109989241	Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.
0.0	0.5	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.0898927229595	Did she do a great job?
0.0	0.321992702952	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.287228689461	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.183355143914	And here's why.
0.0	0.961040836718	We increased education funding by 37 percent.
0.0	0.0851411985157	What are you going to do for my kids?
0.0	0.183355143914	It was against Assad.
0.0	0.288500852896	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
1.0	0.261197078085	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.

0.0	0.195624068871	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.602986023317	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.102401917348	A bipartisan approach got close.

0.0	0.0655158504896	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.131523869623	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
0.0	0.382087482004	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.

0.0	0.280034799737	Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them.
0.0	0.229150770663	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.858933716617	They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care.
1.0	0.993426324698	But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.
0.0	0.0695874961236	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.335167624728	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.227041270638	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.48881431592	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.014111602427	You find me...

0.0	0.19883996086	Senator Cruz is precisely right.

0.0	0.0286132229307	I like them.
0.0	0.17720329851	And a lot of people are doing that.
0.0	0.238109337436	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.

0.0	0.235298815519	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.478941997638	Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes.
0.0	0.218546109265	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.209207376595	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.473817869743	I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.

0.0	0.0834547954582	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.065220781826	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.158827835703	You want to know what carpet bombing is?

0.0	0.156484150899	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.724500185588	You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.226856869641	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.793787466283	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.0723199483698	You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America.
0.0	0.209960819329	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.212107626662	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.222650470759	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.15559431901	You see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, I'm an optimist
0.0	0.58161445488	These are often very long- term kinds of investments that have to be made.
0.0	0.116331905637	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.345495268297	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.454382012309	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.0528857394391	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.405554688465	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.285750111877	Now, let me just be clear, John.
1.0	0.732914278463	Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.
0.0	0.175766248001	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.383415312993	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.303680464497	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.254559800234	Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees.
0.0	0.262811639308	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.197659175797	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.359590022257	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.

0.0	0.103137126943	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.842328803586	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.799410433354	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.247944135268	We cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of moral nations around this Earth, we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats, because Martha, this will not be the last region where nation-states fail.
0.0	0.13478036955	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.0691096215797	I kind of miss Donald Trump.
0.0	0.217682729504	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
0.0	0.221742870454	I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.
0.0	0.292778562663	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.0138294329136	Okay.
0.0	0.171590789757	I want to thank the people of Iowa for being so welcoming to me.
0.0	0.261085727879	Now, it's very interesting.
0.0	0.222463785092	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.176379052049	Are you not running?
0.0	0.769075458112	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.0878831460379	We need new leadership.
0.0	0.398556338717	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.117737321173	We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.
0.0	0.669512841979	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.103919087461	That's just media stuff.
0.0	0.073079674068	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.378694476842	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.183377273449	And before I say it, I have to say this.
0.0	0.241177312663	My patients are beside themselves.
0.0	0.198710873108	You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down.
0.0	0.0654918803759	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
0.0	0.258812783201	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.
0.0	0.0729964573203	We have made some good progress.
0.0	0.459640352693	So what I had to do then is go back and start working on a bill that wasn't the bill that I wanted.
0.0	0.260450795305	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.0309014372621	And guess what?
0.0	0.182900862549	And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.
0.0	0.163779977879	I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena.
0.0	0.207060079072	No interest," because I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.118636591283	I believe we've got to go further.
0.0	0.722377937718	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.296439962406	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.0289580703026	No, I don't think so.
0.0	0.650439726354	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.397511373741	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0379124858692	...the only reason is -- look...
1.0	0.971914609009	One candidate said, you know what, I don't think it's a great idea that we sell automatic weapons in this country that are used by the military to kill people very rapidly.
0.0	0.304321151532	So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.
0.0	0.263242219751	We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.
0.0	0.0819124104081	Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.
0.0	0.0390611566967	Our president doesn't have a clue.
0.0	0.378167899227	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.238408538103	So I've said, if the big banks don't play by the rules, I will break them up.
0.0	0.183355143914	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.0418491952955	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.108110316267	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.269274498984	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.0398463371365	OK, good.
0.0	0.17269966676	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.183355143914	How about this?
0.0	0.167897016545	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.0769428570497	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.
0.0	0.975172066482	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.0771309294576	No vision at all.
0.0	0.23079475573	I made it when I ran in 2008.
0.0	0.13615868946	The formula is working.
0.0	0.493550379289	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.425668808423	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.00993283553241	Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.
0.0	0.154031549016	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.0773747674559	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.507254720705	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.143756783644	Nothing's gonna get done.
0.0	0.204513793682	As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
0.0	0.316190552721	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.234376463958	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.0901291425633	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.108324207281	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.865500146762	I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.
1.0	0.386263104188	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.0582581609524	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.186221754897	And your point is absolutely well taken.
0.0	0.0809669504515	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.296837466165	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
1.0	0.917518396228	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
0.0	0.440830400309	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.201751671331	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.101933695247	They were wrong.
1.0	0.627532601537	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.305623237346	... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience.
0.0	0.213429755089	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.926642091845	We have artificially low interest rates.
1.0	0.831255929401	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.645594568148	But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America.
0.0	0.49018155451	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.0693156109334	So you might not.
0.0	0.0816852440639	Our next president...
0.0	0.0609626675973	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.308161933375	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.0825125009363	It is ISIS.
0.0	0.368162968741	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.338620679397	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.282667782353	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
0.0	0.96301297667	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.082875844622	As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe.
0.0	0.151349302059	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.28324021855	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.0110165123093	There is a vacuum.
0.0	0.0185888684397	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.0784856086673	That's the difference.

0.0	0.336541052476	When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.
0.0	0.217260567274	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.100993296384	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.109307061101	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.147936611911	I think we all support that.
0.0	0.55787026201	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.290347185064	We actually did it.
0.0	0.121055685468	But I can tell you this.
0.0	0.334723044803	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.112983923699	I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.
0.0	0.320152059106	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.

0.0	0.0752012101015	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.108514245381	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.242942467934	Maybe now we can get it moving again so that we can upgrade it so that it does include all the tools and everything in our arsenal that we can use to try to work with our allies and our friends, come up with better intelligence.
1.0	0.809790700959	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.520463440972	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.174795679288	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.

0.0	0.12839624699	We're dying.
0.0	0.0423210688084	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.470924110662	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.5	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.0304260084633	We have problems with Russia.
0.0	0.240251638893	Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.
0.0	0.413656181526	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.10681007414	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.690242319033	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.395505746332	ISIS, now, is the major priority.
0.0	0.216383341839	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.688544980026	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.150229227354	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.182070393408	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.0525049709746	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.0289580703026	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.621163562248	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.183355143914	It's not.
0.0	0.269211493863	You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.
0.0	0.127209528824	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.714156648752	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
0.0	0.134722880173	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.250288494215	Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values.
0.0	0.58358968442	I'm using my own money.
0.0	0.40693137856	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.219629531884	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.2544614647	They would never be hired again.
0.0	0.934656333089	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.117187851676	Well, I would just repeat that.
0.0	0.0582581609524	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.840058690399	At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.
0.0	0.108879746948	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.089779052473	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.389367473305	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.285855143036	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.286110442023	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.183355143914	That is...
0.0	0.111374023557	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.631639679021	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.38093280188	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.229783274557	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.171369105692	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.133185837471	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.0932203661646	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.252764626923	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.38737890959	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.919187416678	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.630121059334	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.477231307066	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.18006893902	We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
0.0	0.254378224216	Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people.
0.0	0.600583422015	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.017404102133	He's not a leader.
0.0	0.155801353927	On welfare.
0.0	0.521617289767	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.190056821544	So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
0.0	0.268252720183	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.361207307982	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.161371558111	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.102729590159	Absolutely.
0.0	0.547841295813	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
0.0	0.315249835296	It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.
0.0	0.139399515223	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.318222517476	First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.718649022397	And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.
0.0	0.206419226104	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.408799629134	It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.
0.0	0.183355143914	That's what it is.
0.0	0.938506995269	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.233768756081	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.0608087212134	Fine, I'll take it.
0.0	0.578949810543	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.

0.0	0.169884609276	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.375091798102	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.0508817945325	I think they'd want to hear it.
0.0	0.52374519593	You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super PAC and they're advertising against me in Iowa as we speak.
0.0	0.276703656074	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.779694142322	They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?
0.0	0.209960819329	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.355617503903	Every (inaudible) Democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rosa DeLauro, got ears (ph) to legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave.
1.0	0.860661933051	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
