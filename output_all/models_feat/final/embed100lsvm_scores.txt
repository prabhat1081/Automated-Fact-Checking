0.0	0.273804135506	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.445236319294	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...
0.0	0.408924527517	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
1.0	0.431008092049	In 1988, I lost an election because I said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of America.

0.0	0.430442612885	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.450214720523	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.468977256778	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.

0.0	0.423515934286	If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W.

0.0	0.172332138278	I agree with them.
0.0	0.396026940871	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.0	So, so important.
0.0	0.382503239505	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.452726372434	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.233075872989	Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen?
0.0	0.234488605746	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.234030252648	Let me say on that...

0.0	0.387919308291	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.0	You know why?
0.0	0.331726229533	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.

0.0	0.40630612622	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.329319386085	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.342828656258	They're going to take away thousands of jobs.
0.0	0.263294307931	It goes in the right direction.

0.0	0.274831242555	Well, thank you.
0.0	0.319947156536	We saw what happened in Egypt.
0.0	0.567537260407	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.257739138979	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.406850154363	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.314742328041	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.343444657741	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
0.0	0.525245837671	... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.
0.0	0.236785921141	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.276723180666	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.46333672609	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...
0.0	0.392690140535	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.34641560433	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	1.0	It's true.
0.0	0.371281450062	We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.
0.0	0.168406938269	Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.
0.0	0.370177637389	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.234213514104	And they wanted to make sure it got built.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.379928195786	When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.

0.0	0.431942696536	Atlantic City has gone bad.

0.0	0.643555824966	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.334163121783	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.455143257464	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.283081017956	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.519265823584	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
0.0	0.397199570753	That is some group of people.
0.0	0.371311604787	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.401815000786	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.388448723064	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.379404754364	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.294707318774	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.372993242351	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.435208642623	Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.
0.0	0.322672716757	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.

0.0	0.30193791206	They have children who are doing so well, I've met and worked with dreamers.
0.0	0.328936136596	Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
0.0	0.53495850061	My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.
0.0	0.218325961875	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.361106550114	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.405903521877	In all due respect...

0.0	0.335670680206	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.346852341124	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.281860472192	I think President Obama has set a great example.

0.0	0.187569661393	We all understand that.

0.0	0.306330959062	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.52864050341	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.320634622632	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.0	It is.
1.0	0.859499834619	And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money.
0.0	0.34169430786	You don't have to.
0.0	0.261444689813	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.

0.0	0.454720861609	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.

0.0	0.45803470663	It has too much economic power.
0.0	0.302373622757	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
0.0	0.479659853982	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.172332138278	I agree with that.
0.0	0.439098922087	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.

0.0	0.444131403599	There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America.
0.0	0.306061538039	It's coming from more than Mexico.
0.0	0.584105037014	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.

0.0	0.253230761053	Fine, I'll take it.
0.0	0.501857456689	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
0.0	0.494853409934	And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.
0.0	0.488062620452	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.445150837167	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.

0.0	0.390864285674	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.285425457041	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.330803394807	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.156334523199	So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.
0.0	0.461341325369	We were the first in the family.
0.0	0.288471094701	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.

0.0	0.37656571287	It cannot be contained, it must be defeated.
0.0	0.599029252561	We have a stock market that is so bloated.
0.0	0.406985107353	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.
0.0	0.251834341148	And, I will tell you, I love my life.
0.0	0.305221316026	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.363114563886	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.43108073747	Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country.
0.0	0.300250892494	We don't want to be Sweden.
0.0	0.337024654335	That is an egregious act.
0.0	0.296216248417	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.283918916913	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
0.0	0.373984043954	They don't even have a chance.
0.0	0.352661795575	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.233503378923	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.518752300471	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.39286874379	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.353575235002	We must keep America safe from this threat.
0.0	0.237086687256	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.329351041284	All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.
0.0	0.234366938743	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.485684002918	It's one of 15 strategic goals I've set out to make our country a better place by cutting these sort of deaths in half in the next five years.
0.0	0.31513054642	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.230487727292	We need more principle.
0.0	0.294225572865	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.36305696301	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.41079408352	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.408243827678	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.376090629657	Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted.
0.0	0.35359274816	When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.

0.0	0.369180077077	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.617248710946	We raised the minimum wage.
0.0	0.462858580017	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
1.0	0.475912287886	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.233274580585	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.217425547611	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.255698381705	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.424247611049	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.515380991606	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.295418629817	I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.209926819149	And I believe he is absolutely right.
0.0	0.304913626973	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.338108656447	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.36307868112	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.421033910653	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.353870957587	We can't even go there.
0.0	0.136841222349	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.289822017817	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.291563310021	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.338314782988	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.213847545931	And he'll say, "Please, please, please."
0.0	0.323847845514	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.548855456295	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.321259038796	We will be there soon.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.217000039299	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.329408036338	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.28252224081	He didn't know.
0.0	0.184639751859	... and I'd like to respond.
0.0	0.306463654842	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.412769401827	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.517203026837	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.47343468661	We now have a gun on every table.
0.0	0.212055119654	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.438565410747	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.0	That's it.
0.0	0.371574641556	The facts are are very, very simple.
0.0	0.540594303588	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.288201524976	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.344630618703	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.459611763762	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.
0.0	0.321335116003	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.47322128261	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.262767740959	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.411834101208	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.501402468098	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.169439665086	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.557251346958	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.329877402141	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.225216845251	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.
0.0	0.192954126003	But get this.
0.0	0.469203317775	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.485474367651	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.421888672724	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.195012676466	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.32761339068	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.578210093096	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.275961055789	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.422034014555	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.361428768211	He couldn't answer the question.
1.0	0.641608284801	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.247545896947	I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.
0.0	0.220946477892	We can do that.
0.0	0.2935595673	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.332364382045	And here's the problem in this country right now.
0.0	0.311383072018	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.404021674907	this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.
0.0	0.419412662063	I've spent my entire life, since I started as a young lawyer for the Children's Defense Fund, trying to figure out how we can even the odds for so many people in America, this great country of ours, who are behind, who don't have a chance.
0.0	0.171219634066	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.196716408742	Did she do a great job?
0.0	0.287020609669	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.268839355073	And I think has had a big impact.
0.0	0.251243512514	Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.
0.0	0.428412408585	The Libyans turned out for one of the most successful, fairest elections that any Arab country has had.
0.0	0.311592348887	We need to do it now as a nation.
0.0	0.0	No, no.
0.0	0.413024845817	Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.
0.0	0.353089737837	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.518505565033	Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally.
0.0	0.530808165442	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.312071304076	The problem is...
0.0	0.538654329463	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.276675476574	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.330998953854	I was the architect.
0.0	0.473129895037	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.672089421775	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
0.0	0.295191190394	Listen, we can solve immigration.
0.0	0.494637037063	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.353008260426	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.365461949777	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.430790513417	The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world.
0.0	0.28842715848	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.428760326977	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.2444628542	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.279012786732	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.377952243189	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.337118098102	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.389134514714	If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune.
0.0	0.48910584193	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.396316804233	I was in Burlington, Iowa.
0.0	0.224406019915	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.

1.0	0.577716296496	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.0	And here's why.
0.0	0.365808517489	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.248776517954	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.

0.0	0.607120138046	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.

0.0	0.466622551469	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.580306100551	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.346425973736	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.371979949431	Unless you are clinically insane...

0.0	0.0	What do we do?
0.0	0.399104452846	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.448826631375	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.222685052787	Looking forward to it.
0.0	0.45586095838	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.506202789243	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.

0.0	0.379039085427	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.330879017874	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.418643577532	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.386924897822	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	1.0	I never said that.

0.0	0.372394390066	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.294687548127	Now, what does that mean?
0.0	0.42981008916	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.41613475885	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?
0.0	0.47539888646	In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.
0.0	0.339149962886	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.560559252633	We have to end -- education has to be local.
0.0	0.404932207556	As Americans, we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet, but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies, to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability.
0.0	0.373022088101	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.0	But you know what?
0.0	0.34878829497	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.211346051041	It really is important that we go forward on this.
0.0	0.395093526491	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.437665362966	First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, "they cannot have it all."
0.0	0.403987129552	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.
0.0	0.323876597033	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.391555854911	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.250617207971	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.301711006123	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
0.0	0.27338003175	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.427626177891	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.266106418062	I say, "That's a terrible story.
0.0	0.46370382616	The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.
0.0	0.405555198772	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.394735461878	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.20155850774	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.370051229261	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.574855187056	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.299048190984	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.404577678034	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.428235541358	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.401823310113	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.405555198772	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.295652263978	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.354623686161	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.
0.0	0.344670600268	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.329281014198	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.208396743146	I like it.
0.0	0.487129660013	First of all...
0.0	0.376097431404	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.602727468403	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.518625984842	And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.
0.0	0.170261139973	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.456026523274	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.352904765131	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.327907536178	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.445191287279	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.412981267398	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.521284615134	It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested.
0.0	0.327060859343	They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.
0.0	0.474419885822	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.386393490835	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.272034224247	... and say there is something more important than money.
0.0	0.386802643792	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
1.0	0.479632135246	And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent.
0.0	0.430916569372	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.44869756438	That would be a disaster for this country.
0.0	0.358694868059	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.41960740192	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.417333440882	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.439560952406	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
0.0	0.271255002911	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.335812558869	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.
1.0	0.770403656487	I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance.
0.0	0.404805189853	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.451660466872	I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.
0.0	0.345106262385	Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire.
0.0	0.146453588972	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.296977542339	We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States.
0.0	0.351932354192	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.5152476029	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.519120386818	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.345789827346	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.33940637129	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.
0.0	0.239222460986	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.40920263494	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.356414739574	I can't do it.
0.0	0.35293440488	It will be a way of life.
1.0	0.405351278461	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.2934728847	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.489883855252	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.315231021813	We should be supportive of that effort.
0.0	0.419445823889	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.340004877487	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.395220870605	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.307999560102	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.430784044494	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.411646984848	My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves.
0.0	0.36972357242	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.36763514646	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.538447550547	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.448649939935	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.468209110504	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.304276424551	Go to YouTube.
0.0	0.179455340356	Yeah.
0.0	0.444838902778	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.576289231904	And second of all...
0.0	0.410724486101	We don't eliminate Medicare.
0.0	0.598186930239	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.30039774545	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.
0.0	0.414168687546	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.301824631587	I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.
0.0	0.345928144826	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.255015364013	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
0.0	0.368652593786	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.348154429367	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.459747528025	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.
0.0	0.364366686544	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
0.0	0.42780883673	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.4127200686	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.454623964235	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.243610270976	I think we're at war with jihadists who have --
0.0	0.311957738361	But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding.
0.0	0.403232507483	Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.243761049594	So I've watched the politicians.
1.0	0.717437550486	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.478775031595	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.345382118306	Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.
0.0	0.364430550739	So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years -- you know, we're at $8 trillion now.
0.0	0.38345864124	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.

0.0	1.0	Of course not.
0.0	0.539195022046	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
1.0	0.784690375468	We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.
0.0	0.356421616902	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.30287842517	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.501325923138	Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care.
0.0	0.260451778989	You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question.
0.0	0.21978940676	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.325146755038	People who we should be welcoming and working with.
0.0	0.0	So did you.
0.0	0.25940193782	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.48428711004	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.465748683436	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.503867784484	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.338131292029	No, Martha, I would not.
0.0	0.285957792393	There's a lot packed into that statement.
0.0	0.514589809076	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.509798311885	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
0.0	0.380319813755	And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country.
0.0	0.589708562445	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.162065225572	They're a great family.
0.0	0.422781780757	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.396347899673	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.512926037321	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.497339318797	Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
0.0	0.395632263387	It's making...
0.0	0.376020425894	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.489158129323	Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.
0.0	0.372208249882	It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.
0.0	0.329735443738	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.354570139195	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.312925721953	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.28560861043	Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.
0.0	0.181521658894	Everybody should.
1.0	0.758721817315	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.455792189335	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.335931495828	Because we need money.
0.0	0.363756687515	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.399754192624	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.22593474509	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.403244226872	If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.
0.0	0.373227313193	But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
0.0	0.350882865139	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.494808909007	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.356139286949	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.400637955806	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.202007505633	What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.
0.0	0.303488975747	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.377797846301	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.212957929806	We got it.
1.0	0.607927294728	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.282722524178	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.404231564999	And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation.
1.0	0.819729273169	So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education.
0.0	0.387638218371	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.275855126713	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.218196185112	There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better.
0.0	0.0	Sure.
0.0	0.0	But Megyn...
0.0	0.361602800619	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.28173550843	And we need the right people.
0.0	0.251185128713	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.406206453041	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.329785834724	And who's compromised and who is principled.
0.0	0.295016489118	Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.210796180098	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.349492794981	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.420121027369	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.35612247882	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.185852191569	It is not tough talk.
0.0	0.343647915124	But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college.
1.0	0.38487852999	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.38090108762	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.438922555559	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.352895099017	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.
0.0	0.471741321345	Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago.
0.0	0.264222577965	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.461319535143	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.
0.0	0.317770013319	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.471309872064	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.417451561169	Social Security, which Republicans call a Ponzi scheme, may face privatization.
0.0	0.220383886252	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.480766655483	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.0	Again...
0.0	0.354208836432	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.314227961811	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.37323083271	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.295828810037	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.32385059858	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.500006743312	It's their money.
0.0	0.420147384231	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.431019555681	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.32630278754	Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title.
0.0	0.203737193271	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.453884312957	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.308046706416	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.350357655467	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.488019825263	He hit oil.
0.0	0.247739767239	Yes.
0.0	0.366296364952	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.327203944852	They're a scam.
0.0	0.162166773225	It feels different.
0.0	0.352586379668	Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare?
0.0	0.360184504377	My mother's dream -- and she died very young, but my mother's dream for her whole life was to be able to get out of that rent-controlled apartment and own a home of her own.
0.0	0.356779673607	Making sure that Muslim Americans don't feel left out or marginalized at the very moment when we need their help.
0.0	0.461308416682	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.217431928323	And they're all over the place.
0.0	0.187135330465	Not good.
0.0	0.351491976677	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.334538087315	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.
0.0	0.359194835993	But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.
0.0	0.381237315883	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.228753913597	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.351449571851	Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild.
0.0	0.382930104546	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.121430255634	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
1.0	0.743684558689	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.432815948551	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.49261283988	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.48111474325	Many are in this building.
0.0	0.461639391746	Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.
0.0	0.257615627643	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.521935013401	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.400455692389	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.355647994475	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.320191005928	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
0.0	0.496511849287	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.155186899365	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.292781405332	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.158254013108	Now I'm not doing that...I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?
0.0	0.415631523075	We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.
0.0	0.137299709638	Think about that.
0.0	0.320296453013	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.60938738839	We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.
0.0	0.271063964587	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
0.0	0.354431642671	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.494649321682	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.529440035585	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
1.0	0.806521434239	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.378124969991	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.403705802783	You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.
0.0	0.346419994651	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.394599788732	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.332864127898	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.34672346913	But Obamacare kicks in in 2016.
0.0	0.288260957403	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.413560845412	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.611925790046	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.305297700634	...Chris...
0.0	0.425563682229	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.241521690004	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
1.0	0.775843561426	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
1.0	0.656036149712	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.296429102669	That's not fair.
0.0	0.445234939209	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.416784723787	We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.
0.0	0.310683168877	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.43625015206	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.288201524976	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.37969963849	We did our own rallies.
0.0	0.211593084863	Okay, thank you.
0.0	0.3671100669	And we should be a welcoming nation.
0.0	0.0	We do.
0.0	0.436914185726	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.454588727767	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
1.0	0.568982267075	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.474413215518	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.294048300173	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.394591339957	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.363858748049	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.533424325377	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.474372162208	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.221668892771	We were wrong.
0.0	0.505693356967	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.462004129489	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.380656659639	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.270568156848	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.416077489249	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.237489609546	Nothing's gonna get done.
0.0	0.411820871767	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
0.0	0.517447476832	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.524270171558	The DNC has hired vendors.
0.0	0.20868418276	I've gotten to do some incredible things.
0.0	0.438688993335	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.422982048939	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.470335248537	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.466706863428	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.273474733393	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.31242045763	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
0.0	0.242009586133	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.205016623508	As a Catholic, that's what I want to do.
0.0	0.430827918324	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.376508529859	Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.
0.0	0.362207184362	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.

0.0	0.472416609521	The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.
1.0	0.827185043386	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.376338864723	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.253898092319	I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here...
0.0	0.322932442901	I -- I believe that we should make community college free.
0.0	0.254454437812	It's a joke.
0.0	0.321126034142	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.318221189144	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.549045608666	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.456144346208	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.497849523819	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.26191515129	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.309297551204	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.3534975796	It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them.
0.0	0.375595160143	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.379725538782	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.345840794896	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.412771241613	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.38736220237	I was there in '89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.
0.0	0.312071304076	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.438932817886	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
0.0	0.312071304076	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.439448516545	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.67054809969	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.273696371524	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.497275245925	But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.
0.0	0.347019977547	But I was born here.
0.0	0.408343708189	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
0.0	0.448768303005	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.410512427718	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.358959859159	(APPLAUSE) They're trying to prevent people from registering to vote.
0.0	0.340487301426	The economy was really booming.

0.0	0.380940713175	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.317708291271	I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena.
0.0	0.509674092848	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.578502376148	That's the secondary issue.
0.0	0.380136181708	You have a problem with ISIS.
0.0	0.413491707719	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.
0.0	0.325817097652	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.36588187939	In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston.
0.0	0.392836833825	And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.
1.0	0.689392509722	Very few children.
0.0	0.305797804623	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.506774451288	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.220434116052	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.25772054985	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.361852110433	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.479258360691	And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending.
0.0	0.371419197471	You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?
0.0	0.261179589321	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.21008166854	Oh, great.
0.0	0.0	She did.
0.0	0.170551385736	How great is that?
0.0	0.228886143959	I hope those are the issues we'll discuss.
0.0	0.395605086021	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.375315654897	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.260355068879	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.353057349454	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.32560292767	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.38932467247	Well, you know, governor, I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010.
0.0	0.3497253215	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.445498642968	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
1.0	0.555204508281	It was below zero.
0.0	0.29385793407	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.329634760316	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.362430688583	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.31993924533	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.426651000008	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.225112352075	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.
0.0	0.482706275819	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.359013018378	It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control.
0.0	0.434935787798	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
0.0	0.529502561962	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.170551385736	He does great.
0.0	0.44121979848	So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out.
0.0	0.488462410647	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.328288902932	Barack Obama wants to change America.
0.0	0.422881396751	... (inaudible) opening statement.
0.0	0.468419540653	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.247484255333	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.439512538973	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
0.0	0.310124569267	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.426790015494	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.230827023023	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.495291296891	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.299584314927	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.325594319243	I'm not using donors.
1.0	0.842790750665	Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education.
0.0	0.285337738796	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.34474878634	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.470049048776	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.43983569095	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.360641115201	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.361349578737	I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace.
0.0	0.503428828699	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.553506930607	And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.361463801463	And your point is absolutely well taken.
0.0	0.488742427726	When you ran in 2000, you said that we needed federal robust regulations.
0.0	0.472196397316	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.242553473797	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.612250295487	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.20011281968	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
1.0	0.691715397126	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
1.0	0.445565949562	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.188206293175	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.445841209205	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.470688511592	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.352433870877	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.282000669407	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.44761801333	We both made the identical promises.
0.0	0.343990713729	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
0.0	0.145764886115	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.563939179226	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.558765119214	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
0.0	0.320923729292	Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS.
1.0	0.594010462217	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.236659071366	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.295389558489	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.355761696431	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.266869683784	They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).
0.0	0.365801761855	And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.26635040591	We now finally are where we need to be.
0.0	0.610176119044	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.408554246048	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.340478691232	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
1.0	0.840653254768	I lost that election by three percentage points.
0.0	0.328522961505	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.345577682163	We have no borders.
0.0	0.382575338002	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.394574495166	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.572505034609	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.208067116678	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.462601215042	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.255626296809	And it's just not going to work.
0.0	0.313794929567	I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security.
0.0	0.406694758226	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.389301341968	This is revolutionary for education in America.
0.0	0.262187402636	And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?
0.0	0.398800404936	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.49115515846	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.202191130846	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.331648788013	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.350134682	Like, I'm standing here, I -- I watched the video of Senator Cruz.
0.0	0.263673978352	What a brilliant idea that would be.
0.0	0.249604401956	Because I've seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime.
0.0	0.33001897417	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.179455340356	Yeah.
0.0	0.454834762487	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.0	So you know what?
0.0	0.465538280737	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.513902109014	But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
0.0	0.315962316788	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.351016818684	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.49910046119	Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
0.0	0.335783160469	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.357712310135	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.34169430786	No, they shouldn't.
0.0	0.278123764061	It's not crass.
0.0	0.488664344588	Bill after coming home from Japan, flying 33 missions.
0.0	0.0	This is 2016.
1.0	0.3031880638	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.221543797977	But not for us.
0.0	0.490876349023	So I believe that over the next few years, not tomorrow, but over the next few years, we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.277228042392	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.398585171225	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.243150647707	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.260021031101	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.490035683444	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.285827514537	And people are saying, "What's going on?
0.0	0.367798115477	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
1.0	0.80969996424	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.685765099088	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.353295358299	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.183977599195	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.345577782266	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.412378278582	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.486436120632	They serve in the military.
0.0	0.137130932278	You're welcome.
0.0	0.403042948522	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.617855862442	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.423434470286	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.360591243571	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.411190012782	And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't."
0.0	0.379445819035	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.380365860474	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.359203110899	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
0.0	0.185889144884	We need that thinking.
0.0	0.479148482461	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.398254721657	There are no simple solutions.
0.0	0.550468059423	You do legislation.
0.0	0.468989169903	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
1.0	0.643485345812	Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.
0.0	0.36297116528	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.33027099064	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.459948725716	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.346878247928	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.
0.0	0.17830819053	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.314115081927	And that is what we have done in Ohio.
0.0	0.485218673144	They all have jobs.
0.0	0.366025431728	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.632847499787	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.36768026398	Give people a chance.
0.0	0.0	He sure did.

0.0	0.483705304834	I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here.

0.0	0.385421010947	You can't hide behind parliamentary tricks.
0.0	0.408039031878	We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party.
0.0	0.0	You know why?
0.0	0.322996246826	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.440786875661	So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.

0.0	0.221189775745	That is exactly...
0.0	0.276220837398	And I say that to Nikki.

0.0	0.320612633279	Who denies that it is crazy...
0.0	0.363187563142	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.51866532607	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.295407504201	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.242530835136	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.486928400829	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.321212805647	What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy, and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need.
0.0	0.542038002475	Tear down the EPA's blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates.
0.0	0.490147497839	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.400852861771	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.168953906	I'll say this.
0.0	0.219370897524	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.381052338814	My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.
0.0	0.322299562644	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.

0.0	0.612816038003	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.379988082592	But those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort.
0.0	0.206917694562	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
1.0	0.450218519779	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.444502828757	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.409573407686	As governor, we continued to work together.
0.0	0.345493286413	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.265766929398	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.349567649753	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.290537469729	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
0.0	0.314417353719	So, your original question is the right question.
0.0	0.387216753058	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.268281976904	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.277684828801	... What was your question...
0.0	0.530808165442	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.307079521305	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.625810136705	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.421013603695	Dynamically.
0.0	0.54209387523	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.479364006621	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.218665970197	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.295572693115	It sounds crass.
0.0	0.422606236434	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.362265455446	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.422179770335	But I would add this.
0.0	0.45214441158	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.394705741114	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.439586747561	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.586382080551	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.463686031033	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
0.0	0.534776915799	Number one...
0.0	0.35112111296	And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.343848367548	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...
0.0	0.690791127343	$5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.376858975891	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.23055927639	They were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.496959060401	In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, "what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"
1.0	0.455761554307	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.481295769938	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.191147783801	You just want to...
0.0	0.502506561119	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.512099113618	Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.
0.0	0.451567633644	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.46696194087	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.351442864424	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.412561724299	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
0.0	0.304593719725	How stupid are our leaders?
0.0	0.333940710296	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.36081280125	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.389817188808	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.388021003238	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.421597792247	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.24742412546	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.253346713007	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.
0.0	0.329654889164	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.288887683899	That's because we've put conservative policies in place.
0.0	0.258474330056	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.509008112067	She voted for it.
0.0	0.409012996843	I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.
1.0	0.364786426663	The 500,000 who came home with PTSD, and traumatic brain injury.
0.0	0.484268565422	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.

0.0	0.170551385736	Great.
0.0	0.563300741915	But -- but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages.
0.0	0.321991618791	I don't think a halt is necessary.
0.0	0.308835675536	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.422683370587	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.321075335686	I mean, my dad went to college on a G.I.
0.0	0.327799809552	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
1.0	0.813657457916	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.477024900317	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.398405786511	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.161118079207	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.397549802243	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.267084391819	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.293190028974	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
0.0	0.312071304076	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.395831660319	As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.
0.0	0.436744931265	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.40766923746	If I am elected president...
0.0	0.243863967588	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.420161258667	They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.
0.0	0.208396743146	I like them.
0.0	0.32557424596	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.445961210908	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
1.0	0.626213757607	7 percent and 8 percent to go to college?
0.0	0.220083176667	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.247739767239	Yes.
0.0	0.274306146298	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.509557316243	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
0.0	0.599992018417	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.498684843293	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.229465799906	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.430212503881	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.398660982134	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.28517158899	You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that.
0.0	0.313821652507	... but wait a minute...
0.0	0.527513643832	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.387334570292	They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America.
0.0	0.382123778768	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.30478870441	You have a bigger problem with China.
0.0	0.323189056329	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.318713764965	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.355173309811	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
1.0	0.516926595469	I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer.
0.0	0.46411286431	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.367321105687	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.511335689279	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.457653723819	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.419752712544	And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.
0.0	0.174308599186	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.296958468094	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.52434940408	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.424603292645	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.
0.0	0.376070731621	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.470902392511	They are anxious on a number of levels.
0.0	0.521851803025	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.422269709548	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.
1.0	0.707329686944	Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.318434857671	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.320096755486	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.
0.0	0.515174997287	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.447213634211	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.308338406518	That's not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.
0.0	0.445338307741	I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground.
0.0	0.379680752646	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.389481946854	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
1.0	0.612539763548	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.42774398953	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.447724249106	My son is not a pair of boots on the ground.
0.0	0.346803009383	So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.
0.0	0.321162579457	... Chris, keep it coming...
0.0	0.463252127081	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.
0.0	0.234030252648	Let me say this.
0.0	0.143620308783	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.506987788822	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.335200120527	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.357421939239	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.312032218096	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.436509637995	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.
0.0	0.201675828748	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.443793784542	I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
0.0	0.338074434839	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.311258665313	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.38644740364	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.559136017211	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.500787246319	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.337087557096	If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
0.0	0.193766483158	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.317668091566	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.424065256806	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.363987093836	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
0.0	0.28055570096	I don't need the rhetoric.
0.0	0.247275183338	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.548595193359	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.413699318705	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
1.0	0.513381209972	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.674856854674	They make a billion dollars a day.
0.0	0.259869119975	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.202199110582	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
1.0	0.617019593989	They were wrong.
0.0	0.64296397397	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.412863111377	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.410317147466	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.500691524341	That means medical.
0.0	0.321787153271	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.47503287988	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.250312000936	You see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, I'm an optimist
0.0	0.39175585685	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.
0.0	0.337737053252	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.403171508943	Starting with our children and moving forward.
0.0	0.364813986824	She did it for convenience.
0.0	0.0	May I respond?
0.0	0.446908728877	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.305318540096	Thank you Chris...
0.0	0.395743771609	But also, I can't fake anger.
1.0	0.505482685434	In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.
0.0	0.467036351036	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
0.0	0.330376155565	And that's what I will do as your president.
0.0	0.38074069894	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.444958848864	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.267973611389	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.305297700634	...Chris...
0.0	0.425254928233	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.549562106766	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.496949483241	The bill would involve legalization.
0.0	0.41371176094	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.249169634806	But wait, I just want to say this Senator.
0.0	0.58491257221	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.388425026453	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.3860347138	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.263254020313	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.295238923776	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.394774534341	They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe.
0.0	0.278793260443	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.581091666844	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.421277395809	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.282050189412	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.427653855776	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.254598759391	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.471591505249	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.323891741121	That's the job.
0.0	0.312071304076	Megyn, that's the problem.
0.0	0.418799507798	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.364865061557	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.0	That's what should be done.
1.0	0.850327735253	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.452851245183	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.0	What should we do?
0.0	0.508563989104	We have three children, eight, five and one.
0.0	0.371802236193	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.285314950344	Yes, we must protect our borders.
0.0	0.234452536409	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
0.0	0.402561892583	They have to be alert to problems.
0.0	0.284787433078	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.440930691617	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.482151014109	We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.
0.0	0.436563135207	Media notwithstanding.
0.0	0.432097218373	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.250676665242	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.338622221285	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.
0.0	0.0	We actually did it.
0.0	0.50435874852	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.545035374708	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.486849744837	But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
0.0	0.464022869803	It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act.
0.0	0.284391967365	They don't like that.
0.0	0.34169430786	Don't do it."
0.0	0.479398081974	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.341660630628	I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history.
0.0	0.136767067941	But they're not good.
1.0	0.790455716175	They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.
0.0	0.374595211629	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.392810404329	By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa.
0.0	0.334280436156	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.3971224806	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.44140028936	So it's unfair to say in total...
0.0	0.504756884549	It had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.388985872938	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.444221207372	Last point.
0.0	0.1869319492	I'm proud of my family.
0.0	0.278290280367	And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.
0.0	0.254204881411	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.
0.0	0.426335110683	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.322195184344	I have a problem with that, Martha.
0.0	0.309881212581	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.443335624758	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.383215440715	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.34613082597	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.220259184173	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.577400420186	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
1.0	0.804763076386	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.312968489481	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.396311597853	You know where their United States headquarters is located?
0.0	0.201055075496	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
1.0	0.785823486103	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
1.0	0.394426746444	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.486185092054	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.51394271499	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.52748070634	They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
0.0	0.351909625465	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.34981229513	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.338595710705	Our country has tremendous potential.
0.0	0.277026595847	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.212192390619	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.185500579431	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.294149744662	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.161230202727	And there's a lot.
0.0	0.338014521873	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.380778720475	RADDATZ: OK. Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, right here at Saint Anselm college, Neil Levesque.
0.0	0.364147914802	The no-fly zone, I would hope, would be also shared by Russia.
0.0	0.471973543167	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.416186829349	There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan.
0.0	0.5276808881	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.421674322916	And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.
0.0	0.359818848967	When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.
0.0	0.236503506222	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.351901592116	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.554433008655	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...
0.0	0.288628328107	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.0	May I respond?
0.0	0.571101646469	That's 13,000 miles.
1.0	0.371236543038	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.387480759959	The United States has, unfortunately, been victimized by terrorism going back decades.
0.0	0.319359157817	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.472155656038	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.219290559642	We need -- we need somebody -- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.
0.0	0.402952015022	I think that is the number one requirement.
0.0	0.260408265532	And look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that.
0.0	0.427756905184	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.431244731388	We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it.
0.0	0.381473729228	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.264632275238	I would just say that...
0.0	0.275090360166	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.427865668445	I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks.
0.0	0.398152926255	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
1.0	0.671559592457	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.316108972668	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.39785062259	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.271497233913	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.431978735938	I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
0.0	0.370537852459	If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
0.0	0.212748429296	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.222079615392	And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.
0.0	0.593881133687	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.41478140266	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.265056654578	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.294905219001	Well, you've got to be on top of it right away.
0.0	0.455631502504	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.31311969957	We have made some good progress.
0.0	0.262355898241	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.336404621972	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.311704521556	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.332237790719	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.345634530522	We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
1.0	0.464705804941	We passed it after 9/11.
0.0	0.316200906904	This is a terribly complicated issue.
0.0	0.241548531389	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.311403970033	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.179455340356	Yeah.
0.0	0.288144316114	Martha, thank you.
0.0	0.371234575355	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.593201653932	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.295494453304	They're terrified by the saber rattling.
0.0	0.477236445414	I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment.
0.0	0.296955676329	You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.
0.0	0.292033946665	I kind of miss Donald Trump.
0.0	0.337789420847	): Secretary...
0.0	0.296592700695	But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said.
1.0	0.381327899483	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.432197328569	And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't.
0.0	0.362468291627	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.47476193124	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.397654916777	Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.
0.0	0.452283273666	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.
0.0	0.175650331322	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.344957124988	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.306075686235	We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
0.0	0.626397180877	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
0.0	0.263694241294	I think this is a very difficult issue.
0.0	0.389957624259	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.177605561575	I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
0.0	0.253353762685	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.290110156066	They have no choice.
0.0	0.378087044097	As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election.
0.0	0.292369711063	And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.
0.0	0.645142116558	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.336258769056	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.
0.0	0.388513592431	But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it.
0.0	0.281232138026	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.485652884681	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.157048267818	Look--
0.0	0.463887114	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.274625250999	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.370049339669	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.312327129663	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.
0.0	0.404700997787	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.320531098518	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.244177684244	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.354677164709	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.333926670458	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
0.0	0.371806029126	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.137063371762	I think he'd be a great spirit."
0.0	0.439327228246	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.377018875832	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.430799816727	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.218295566592	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.462825557855	And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring.
0.0	0.40804851223	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.38121300498	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.461691280016	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.361914338038	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.430035062641	They;re gone.
0.0	0.227113129457	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.423471134563	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.280292583002	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.505406935458	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.159276420653	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.434401032875	Drugs have taken far too many of our citizens.
0.0	0.513590327346	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.170932024059	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.353567138684	I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.
0.0	0.364945802157	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.46480799115	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
1.0	0.603614023956	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.29687075539	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.469285210121	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.365400501748	The guns don't pull the trigger.
1.0	0.261080038548	They're rapists.
0.0	0.379075174805	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.381789625319	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.458074626969	Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.522772638201	We have a corrupt campaign finance system dominated by Super PACs.
0.0	0.394311608949	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.3728073664	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.357578575998	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.433205968154	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.302434944887	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.367821577439	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.374821437183	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.368082612002	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.578381965503	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
1.0	0.718931044067	What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons.
0.0	0.568689243662	Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.
0.0	0.251706337693	They're killing us.
0.0	0.486986566868	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.329642564192	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.589593925579	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.347638760216	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
0.0	0.343325693278	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.372522194088	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.359477410426	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.245539618781	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.361166570403	Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.
0.0	0.312659594102	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.428343271838	I've employed -- I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
0.0	0.352141271336	You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future.
0.0	0.378713326981	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
1.0	0.858620317643	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
1.0	0.866009502777	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.31095924412	Find out what I said to Greenspan.
0.0	0.426173594959	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.245539618781	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.41900848833	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.372521060309	Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength.
0.0	0.470895103768	This country is changing.
0.0	0.566020628516	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.391292281986	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.411151916917	It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.
0.0	0.357438203865	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.38102549912	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.212646182678	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.425513251801	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.22454671299	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.21784741201	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.233232883207	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.444522400501	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.374130441326	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.292121008745	... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street.
0.0	0.555386891207	Why is it that we are spending per capita far, far more than Canada, which is 100 miles away from my door, that guarantees health care to all people?
0.0	0.23714383425	Oh.
0.0	0.530969254135	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.247739767239	Yes.
1.0	0.518941236674	The Republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times.
0.0	0.31844763588	Now, you'd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me?
0.0	0.276923297253	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.610353576747	Number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own.
0.0	0.397008957991	We overcame the NRA's objections.

0.0	0.197248131447	Excuse me.
0.0	0.400413018401	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.316726540493	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
0.0	0.220763269605	We're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.479534851123	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.

0.0	0.498186703446	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.38585721712	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.41939457765	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.367368000949	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.321894250745	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.

0.0	0.298972381097	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.319914803985	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.0	I tell you that.
0.0	0.503421318722	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.243271662408	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.269820317763	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.514137132972	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.137299709638	Think about it.
0.0	0.375076632365	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.353709439602	So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.
0.0	0.417796698139	It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.
0.0	0.329373250759	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.368866674283	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.32598347747	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.454750124922	Our healthcare is a horror show.

0.0	0.474650739644	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.381084580848	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.44675123417	So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
0.0	0.39583260583	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.
0.0	0.313478294098	But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go.
0.0	0.447557503015	I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that's what Iowans like to do.
0.0	0.480859348449	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.
0.0	0.259829072244	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.242128098846	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.430407045465	I watched the video of Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.373293079897	A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this.
0.0	0.326444236275	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.54691912258	... we have the tools in federal law to do this now.
0.0	0.442155858409	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.411471995279	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.523521815524	We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that's what's keeping him contained.
0.0	0.321928611823	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.408707949878	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
1.0	0.388255320513	They stole it.
0.0	0.316186106243	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.495535893739	Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS.
0.0	0.399932953966	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.332540314549	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.388299126013	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.421741389262	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.315207886671	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.286225193713	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.330416387476	And those countries who are opposed to Islam, they are going to have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today.
0.0	0.369686553386	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.365104045758	So, yes, this has developed.
1.0	0.818155516452	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.401173544506	As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.227915140347	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.339231872349	And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition, including Russia, to help us destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.353467203505	And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
0.0	0.323344276642	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.413624596197	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.365992586528	Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens.
0.0	0.495553464264	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.479240020733	What about hydroelectric power?
0.0	0.466362130289	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.221790209816	...No, sir...
0.0	0.404840087347	I mean, let's talk about this arc of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about.
0.0	0.413811219027	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.311835230102	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.419258978174	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.212836104222	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.277758337969	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.
0.0	0.39236802216	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.327862119204	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.389751841015	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	1.0	That's true.
0.0	0.227248756453	We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.
0.0	0.612140559807	... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record.
0.0	0.454552541757	... and we will end the illegal immigration.
0.0	0.247739767239	Yes.
0.0	0.475660821103	The business model of Wall Street is fraud.
0.0	0.367083610885	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.167887602111	I'm really rich.
0.0	0.416970299036	You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?
0.0	0.422469941899	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.0	That's right.
0.0	0.192032207543	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.385748231587	They come up to my office.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.62878118065	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.317914558417	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.413293038545	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.615215112499	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.399371181018	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.3558614145	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.36298461297	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.35785649284	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.335038413894	It's not about Donald Trump.
0.0	0.348127210075	That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
0.0	0.507067693412	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.362151666778	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.42931880367	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.369060373386	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.250404905396	It's great to be back.
0.0	0.326568941406	We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.
0.0	0.160923935145	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.401679409631	They're controlled fully -- they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
0.0	0.386788775932	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.438701494919	ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.
0.0	0.283637292089	It is going to be amazingly destructive.
0.0	0.323707341173	We could do a whole show on that.

0.0	0.269753096232	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.

0.0	0.226801969454	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.370185331281	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.348587445247	Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.299882583067	Well, I just want to quickly add...
0.0	0.422419234163	We are doing both at the same time.
0.0	0.264685777132	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.324092187951	David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave.
0.0	0.235068562348	Let me just -- let me just...
0.0	0.221533283217	I think there is a consensus.
0.0	0.387888172716	The list goes on because the differences are so stark.
0.0	0.571351575292	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.

0.0	0.285720027433	Didn't just happen.
0.0	0.305297700634	Chris...
0.0	0.346334426173	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.329023560097	And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump," and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns.

1.0	0.747793112801	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.
0.0	0.48914801854	Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.
0.0	0.486463380252	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.

0.0	0.494772820736	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.51913888337	And if our middle class makes more money, they spend more money, and our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.3013460679	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.481939082206	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.328463403268	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.502887056896	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.301917563066	We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists.
0.0	0.337039504495	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...
0.0	0.226389586464	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.251827327453	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.

0.0	0.457790164517	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
0.0	0.414669594364	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.251541602319	Somebody said, "Oh, that's crass."
0.0	0.466421210292	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.191161789851	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.464743439032	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.295672047115	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.312181464733	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.533123492086	I sell apartments for -- I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.
0.0	0.401936482384	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.
0.0	0.416502859127	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.247739767239	Yes.
0.0	0.286289527576	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.305937832503	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.
0.0	0.328569894425	Marco, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.394574495166	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.338131292029	And Martha...
0.0	0.397021737082	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.442666260586	Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.
0.0	0.367299099863	I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.
0.0	0.27815873567	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.43706020007	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.427294871908	Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.
0.0	0.0	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.377825742942	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.431805314243	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.152826348786	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.395148161004	Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris.
0.0	0.247739767239	Yes.
0.0	0.303612397237	There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
1.0	0.492023653194	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.506746001956	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.348614497991	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.434488863267	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.
0.0	0.426624108104	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.478215121151	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.338241118607	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.342003418419	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.415099037182	You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet...
0.0	0.39882917754	Or a young woman who had been performing at President Obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member.
0.0	0.448155186817	What part is valid?
0.0	0.401486086133	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.297568271766	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.30340789637	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.310422910741	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.32657096864	I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom.
0.0	0.409387718062	And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms.
0.0	0.411197363951	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.379096957106	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.342646965481	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
1.0	0.589685069874	That billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers.
0.0	0.338568496281	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.383564600544	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.350018459342	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.214142783578	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.198511046311	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
1.0	0.750195803353	In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship.
0.0	0.39615458266	It's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement.
0.0	0.428874812662	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.282944808647	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.41048458791	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.275201472437	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.622014723638	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.

0.0	0.345004979073	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.346628220282	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.546934236498	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.451740085575	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.363303844262	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
1.0	0.793799155083	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
0.0	0.500347849858	But the United States is not the policeman of the world.
0.0	0.281675626456	We've been at this a couple of years.
0.0	0.407061722595	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.255524608772	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.351574773922	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.415508248573	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.275939198148	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
0.0	0.427008878172	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.175958829534	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.196402048696	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.368298260443	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.260397664186	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.278682804121	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.567776726109	No hour is too short, no dollar too small.
0.0	0.377000353065	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.320280228943	And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.
0.0	0.40678571654	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.29600197336	... do I go -- let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.489087371406	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.321543354983	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.387689510192	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.332292197115	We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.358684090139	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.
0.0	0.463281283204	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.165981647137	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.389768938341	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.296651102637	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.314515911255	Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that's not good enough.
0.0	0.303135892	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.316298122007	We offered a lot more.
0.0	0.0	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.432908260898	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
0.0	0.477055904527	That is our government today.
0.0	0.341069011238	People were shocked, Trump got it.
0.0	0.237536369302	Absolutely.
0.0	0.362517394164	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.419517027686	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.219660220353	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.216237379034	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
0.0	0.370525793251	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.310604713852	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.520803863407	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.299612798404	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.
0.0	0.299953298923	Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."
1.0	0.595939656655	That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.
0.0	0.332737657605	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.574273717458	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.463214674351	Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.312580129216	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.344734443058	This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along.
0.0	0.399358354993	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.349374835029	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.233805309312	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
1.0	0.530545734795	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.323915366508	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.547392070757	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.231667005551	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.338031374872	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.433565829712	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.343502972849	The people don't work for us.
0.0	0.368848000372	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.337758758523	We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.
0.0	0.258938688769	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.388630170137	Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country.
0.0	0.371007073676	And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
0.0	0.342198916973	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.42174958591	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.361712497809	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.47277642849	I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
0.0	0.52004069337	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.309048695836	I don't have to brag.
0.0	0.222873315276	The mentally ill?
0.0	0.384553132768	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.0	But...
0.0	0.424335361435	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.229377993887	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.208892184529	And they're wonderful people.
0.0	0.419884085566	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.346057114827	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.320261573426	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.376616118092	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.338967792108	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.235302686139	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.186266686395	OK, good.
0.0	0.353733305681	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.367834719453	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.361917312662	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
1.0	0.715418777167	I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians.
0.0	0.218301495751	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.383225554674	... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region.
0.0	0.532574671639	You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.
0.0	0.353968326578	All of these are very difficult issues.
0.0	0.445057846193	In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...
0.0	0.390655674192	I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done.
0.0	0.414673970032	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
1.0	0.738105268381	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.496698195126	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.319395076628	You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.
0.0	0.335083794964	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.33071245974	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.427205551128	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.341492106471	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.226294367988	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.209772246916	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.40146805351	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.219623536881	If not, they can stay where they are.
0.0	0.294337304351	Many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed.
0.0	0.267888634735	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
0.0	0.343207122993	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.
0.0	0.313089443144	I would like to see it updated.
0.0	0.372693312191	I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.
0.0	0.0	It was.
0.0	0.0	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.420717290128	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.370528595354	Hey, I have lobbyists.
0.0	0.408270549967	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.533525217286	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.230811705039	Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.
0.0	1.0	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.334401289029	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.
0.0	0.259789147524	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.356433724388	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.378267777855	She is not qualified to be President of the United States.
0.0	0.16252247486	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.298451718949	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.39845714965	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.374000904735	They can't lead us.
0.0	0.261455206478	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.438059353651	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.349751012203	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.185807200927	Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.
1.0	0.612450262254	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.412493261873	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.412603179499	So it was not against ISIS, it was against -- it was against Assad.
0.0	0.335087161765	Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.
0.0	0.295431725994	You can change your mind.
0.0	0.237536369302	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.35406023829	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.486203004598	Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come...
0.0	0.595614114437	We have artificially low interest rates.
1.0	0.798364077259	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.227303629182	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.491412549933	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.303749998658	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.38336909102	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.409861826824	It didn't have the votes to pass.
0.0	0.636457722054	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.374713667324	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.560789812769	... saying, no middle class tax raises.
0.0	0.323601789316	Martha, if I may...
0.0	0.452181072425	And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow.
0.0	0.398313384959	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.276467072558	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.324037894941	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.370815264881	When do we beat Mexico at the border?
0.0	0.292349925351	That is a pledge that I'm making.
0.0	0.264313148108	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.320116772456	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.250169897123	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.369259676469	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
0.0	0.378313888094	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.379096394403	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.610426870807	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.196728645594	I've always listened to you, Megyn.
0.0	0.321287365849	And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before.
0.0	0.60442569909	The number of heroin deaths are growing very, very significantly.
0.0	0.217426676565	I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is.
0.0	0.35785649284	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.555065398347	Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force.
0.0	0.434786655463	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.462294103609	You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon.
0.0	0.432637990141	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.279330477327	Let me give you the bad news.
0.0	0.421203517211	And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, "if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed.
0.0	0.574825183398	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.407036857493	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.470469336979	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.422471016583	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.35622316455	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.453345733848	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.402763274053	When was the last time you heard China is killing us?
0.0	0.345198498689	I want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, which they have not been doing.
0.0	0.331944356377	Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process.
0.0	0.322739368551	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.308806155635	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.419727141003	For over 200 years, America's light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again.
0.0	0.360631308334	And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...
0.0	0.379806276207	And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears.
0.0	0.428786400666	Our country is in serious trouble.
0.0	0.277591454512	Everybody thought the deal was dead.
0.0	0.388754092425	We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground.
0.0	0.481487719668	It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.
0.0	0.405879585168	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.

0.0	0.392183516581	It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.
0.0	1.0	That's not true.
0.0	0.163337569416	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.362908582614	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.445126811222	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.402440253734	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.530094073658	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.354458667684	We now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act, and I don't think we should have to be defending it among Democrats.
0.0	0.303345738555	I do not believe in unilateral American action.
0.0	0.306792241264	If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say?
0.0	0.145873068498	But here's what's going to happen:
0.0	0.242706500251	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.172249542283	So be very, very careful.
0.0	0.430583068968	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.307781587553	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.41516967475	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.385246921051	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.444181775093	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.377072966634	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.289553690993	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.317706950653	It's not working.
0.0	0.478106415837	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.447558610231	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.19744438156	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
0.0	0.400367563813	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.589685620291	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.303976515255	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.361937163748	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.0	That's right.
0.0	0.321786519944	We will see what the American people are willing to support.
0.0	0.369519711895	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.472758054941	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.398781919046	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.354807940062	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.28669613169	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
1.0	0.583783908549	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.340787128036	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.320903983868	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.
0.0	0.342603910066	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.364424191321	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.357475740967	Chris I was mentioned in that question.
1.0	0.751039917161	And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.
0.0	0.362221352858	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
0.0	0.231032494332	So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
0.0	0.512788032786	I introduced...
0.0	0.5923639117	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.414761337928	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.401619023848	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.
0.0	0.373148584025	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.338942189694	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.234030252648	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.276179567333	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.334953405022	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.374891146719	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.403813691685	Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability.
0.0	0.393548606536	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.299659458748	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.387365210824	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.416820733389	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.283373282237	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.
0.0	0.258556387826	And before I say it, I have to say this.
0.0	0.379467608806	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.376464810077	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.314826914776	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.294782602129	Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home.
0.0	0.389932662673	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.396914221464	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
0.0	0.495045477967	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.359658824738	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.333927809896	This is absolutely absurd.
0.0	0.444372145472	... people all over this country -- not you, Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other.
0.0	0.359288107553	... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.524404273917	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.50524101464	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.39341184584	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.347208042972	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.280996181393	I need your help.
1.0	0.692101771241	And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph).
0.0	0.372447067348	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
0.0	0.673500637107	So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion.
0.0	0.270181303717	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.455039732739	What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS.
0.0	0.277406604837	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.336070649147	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.421885968054	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.278376744584	Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem.
0.0	0.230557682372	It's hate action.
0.0	0.563180508378	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.328883304578	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.327141851651	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.462692430592	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.

0.0	0.330999394029	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.3106402754	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.35097823512	These are very, very real issues.
0.0	0.372372891868	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.403509814131	(inaudible).
0.0	0.315392129888	They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work.
0.0	0.373677181923	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.307910668297	And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it.
0.0	0.430701297376	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
0.0	0.31323986295	And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.
0.0	0.353134845526	I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party's nominee.

0.0	0.186141047741	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.4662112267	No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.
0.0	0.401851790091	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.484289090643	We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.
0.0	0.284787433078	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.402296331049	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.608412487571	There was a minimum wage at the state level, and some places went higher.
0.0	0.479769167456	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
0.0	0.381491563486	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.282570436651	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.188478061205	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.588176801328	And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.
0.0	0.449841554487	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.352600308943	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.320299536335	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.295397571388	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.339097389743	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.437949341929	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.200056072687	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.277406604837	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.315067661701	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.618272234345	Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day.
1.0	0.740624615119	When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.
0.0	0.406610213011	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.336123556175	Chris, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.397337407795	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.263552945707	And I think that's the false choice...
0.0	0.257865295159	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.226169924914	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.397640458649	If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.
0.0	0.383082384165	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.412698284256	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.235507752935	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.
0.0	0.218666580755	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
0.0	0.379428737745	I don't get any money from Wall Street.
0.0	0.41392464444	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.496547838554	And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.
0.0	0.414190800719	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.312181447363	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.293692107727	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.
0.0	0.425711175086	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.343255729658	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.458725243261	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.407531589461	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.366599241712	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.481536455577	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.311851965672	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.
0.0	0.282709496732	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.473007656258	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.668334957089	It costs me $3.
0.0	0.442676569149	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.
1.0	0.920424325642	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.392143523257	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.442438533628	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.429767016276	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.434167619577	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.2131862261	That is why we need to make...

0.0	0.263553656246	As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans.
0.0	0.347341046282	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.0	And why?
0.0	0.398800300157	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.450519600705	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.

0.0	0.324101512268	In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance.
0.0	0.253177000438	I think it's a two-pronged issue.
0.0	0.394634758684	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.201844018529	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.

0.0	0.420579552823	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.367213899355	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.262237586758	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.497946893271	And it will have effects in the private market.
1.0	0.804549219262	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.451439831227	You have to lead.
0.0	0.498774655034	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.321711363543	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.494059671829	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.529029523155	I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.
0.0	0.553801207095	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.358174921426	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.425463345733	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	1.0	I never said that.
0.0	0.320472745992	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.320786932305	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.440810500743	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.338308759876	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.388051568328	But Secretary Clinton is wrong.
0.0	0.432507808527	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.34169430786	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.479043688697	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.34169430786	No, you weren't.
0.0	0.396460093554	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
0.0	0.384867792557	The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
0.0	0.257649612601	We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.
0.0	0.389772670598	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.38020450634	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.336481320119	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.298902842918	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.344502008417	If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.
0.0	0.566286964728	And I used it to pay off my loans.
1.0	0.783544082357	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.210046207467	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.244429175034	And it's an honor to have everybody here.
0.0	0.409797798909	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.309580943472	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.324576444066	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
1.0	0.547231408625	And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
0.0	0.461125851975	We got a U.N. Security council vote.
0.0	0.38041135725	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
0.0	0.416348486732	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.364104689652	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.223168423798	And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a -- that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.
0.0	0.369721224174	I promise.
0.0	0.478131348139	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.468295454498	In the 1980s, it was in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Reagan's administration, and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel, and others were murdered.
0.0	0.237536369302	Absolutely.
0.0	0.411217689771	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.32572089975	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.410135445251	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.286120181573	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
0.0	0.580977144085	It is not because of the tax writeoff.
0.0	0.502357586808	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.427497350294	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.3398926524	They don't have a clue.
0.0	0.453231124609	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.366047051279	And, yes, we are at war with those people.
0.0	0.303130249836	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.328332186275	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.153678881471	Okay.
0.0	0.599771995637	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.439725807621	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.427129085751	We brought together legislation supported by the American Legion, the VFW, the DOD, Vietnam Vets, all of the veterans organizations, which was comprehensive.
0.0	0.477560249246	On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center.
0.0	0.361868316299	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.534554231427	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.498739840946	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.376504151478	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.447028471721	And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.
0.0	0.369619377648	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.334076102703	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.284550137213	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.422887725424	Bottom line.
1.0	0.715762738007	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
1.0	0.408094830739	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.563811676224	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.279524775308	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.
0.0	0.547157052282	When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish Glass-Stegall.
0.0	0.503500663607	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.42007615497	The United States must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.254123367827	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.196935163435	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.41037841123	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.0	That is important.
0.0	0.309661028994	How can you get people to vote for you?"
0.0	0.429576254514	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.221412253549	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.187918893704	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.228399125235	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.404843325652	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.304122323342	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.352033363773	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.30118438837	I didn't know I had so much power.
0.0	0.25193036041	I like how you stand up.
0.0	0.278623270545	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.275855126713	Let me respond...
0.0	0.217103272569	I would not want to go to that point.
0.0	0.25474093276	They've become rich.
0.0	0.195077183546	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
0.0	0.389039451158	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.396195345726	Well, this whole issue concerns me.
0.0	0.270087916153	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.209206305203	Now they're going militarily.
0.0	0.547251176623	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.517084548734	We haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.
0.0	0.280832964399	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.372768638347	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.231378051267	Look, I served on...
0.0	0.442547067014	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.429103623241	And I understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary.
0.0	0.447616393473	Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values.
0.0	0.318329523347	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.404045348654	But people have to be alert.
0.0	0.354600179829	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.330123968373	Well, let's take it one at a time.
0.0	0.367548245618	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.180074056352	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.336576720676	That's the big leagues.
0.0	0.410331434001	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.14687919127	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.395547256939	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.490249083115	States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government.
0.0	0.194033178517	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.169040877745	We've got nothing.
0.0	0.365802888409	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.438163662347	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.324790220426	They do it to us, we don't it.
1.0	0.146855089024	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.304943118215	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.304768468991	Well, there are so many, I don't know where to start.
0.0	0.642418799469	And remember the $5 billion Web site?
0.0	0.363279894181	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.509206992603	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.245143704962	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.389068400662	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.
0.0	0.471171517447	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.614058061186	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.375625225751	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.
0.0	0.178747120191	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.269609305069	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
1.0	0.512744119586	Today, we have 272.
0.0	0.293657706296	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.309232554266	So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.
0.0	0.200461359886	You know, the situation is this.
0.0	0.326051816065	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.314846980267	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.42777522978	I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
0.0	0.399932953966	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.287162399409	Bigger than that?
0.0	0.243581378759	No, I don't think so.
0.0	0.312047790223	If they want to accept our values and our laws.
0.0	0.399428348407	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.304303407585	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.427679215348	They elected moderate leaders.
1.0	0.695437633532	In 1988, just to set the record straight governor, I ran for the U.S. House.
0.0	0.297189172084	You bet they do.
0.0	0.40534349115	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.285663503614	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.380391377206	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.463419826274	People died, and only three people have been fired.
0.0	0.445331434218	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.224833767485	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.421204021931	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.28252224081	He didn't know.
0.0	0.158748680194	I think you're --
0.0	0.201096199916	That's kind of a no-brainer.
0.0	0.538639258707	Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions?
0.0	0.470420407058	We didn't win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America.
0.0	0.260140908844	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.171610346612	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.313595134303	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.310485027816	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.438564257111	I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.172039114493	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.33155077741	Predominantly African-American and Hispanic.
0.0	0.456729075138	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.328514696112	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.192497858678	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.229405743767	I have a wonderful family.
0.0	0.502309709602	And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.
0.0	0.380151260969	He's not arming the Kurds.
0.0	0.353833843223	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.338736855229	And we do have a role in this.
0.0	0.453375935283	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.1383866819	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.439310141596	And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.
0.0	0.352419644147	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.391706112824	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.406777629941	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.413401169588	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.391063362464	We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America.
1.0	0.47253866918	However, what Alan Krueger said in the piece you're referring to is that if we went to $15, there are no international comparisons.
0.0	0.345111623217	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.46263674105	That's fine.
0.0	0.299336067572	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.322311406656	The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering, these are not the perpetrators.
0.0	0.297549383183	I would change them.
0.0	0.346059909003	We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt.
0.0	0.388912149812	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.168953906	He'll say.
0.0	0.415846217832	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.397031254566	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.218563398554	But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.377582176539	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.

0.0	0.517667629968	I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains.
0.0	0.35146868753	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.

0.0	0.237820775005	He's an entertaining guy.
0.0	0.419524461913	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.

0.0	0.432829692545	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.233741857196	In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
0.0	0.34417529284	Your question was you have disagreed...
0.0	0.507065835602	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
0.0	0.314067377401	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
0.0	0.19309106441	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.244744061166	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.411796267997	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.371313327707	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.414207698463	And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said.
0.0	0.469872364855	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.384131144159	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.0	OK.
0.0	0.465846399775	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.273571030303	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.244592380743	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.396102481607	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.340769462056	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
0.0	0.285281574112	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
0.0	0.236929824077	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.523618868541	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.411413156175	Again, with all do respect to Secretary Clinton...
0.0	0.0	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.393373437906	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.49108663117	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.419809814906	And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that.
0.0	0.456150281687	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.381172772024	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.398159924219	All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee.
0.0	0.321899478312	That's my view.
0.0	0.414627548805	Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting...
0.0	0.432091744816	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.457163911966	As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.
0.0	0.412603179499	It is ISIS.
0.0	0.291933852372	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
0.0	0.318644818821	Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...
0.0	0.306215765749	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.426787000604	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.281506035152	So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.
0.0	0.479922018823	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.508929067151	ISIS, now, is the major priority.
0.0	0.347827515573	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.261409635242	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.0	All right.
0.0	0.485517363866	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.394574495166	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.320660990734	So did you, Marco.
0.0	0.46140526639	And we have to stop all the divisions.
0.0	0.370991985988	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.404061953848	I'm meeting with three of them in the next week.
0.0	0.434992931672	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.468629822504	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.341209509264	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.260690314235	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.0	But what...
0.0	0.37211439189	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
1.0	0.670754687071	This small country has welcomed in many refugees.
0.0	0.327624628603	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.320805841569	We saw a dictator overthrown.
0.0	0.424055523204	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.422249006619	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.318029837299	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.609670286438	That is why I support a $12 national federal minimum wage.
0.0	0.0	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.285739266794	They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there.
0.0	0.301614482655	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.32535138363	He said, "I can't get it into China.

0.0	0.34188316451	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.420491662063	It is a disaster.

0.0	0.362141937285	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.205001054794	Nobody can do that like me.
0.0	0.429592087842	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.312665477672	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.497568878148	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.403253294719	At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida.
0.0	0.430864251029	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.498038504655	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.461758262431	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.347473217114	... First of all -- Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.355488866062	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.
0.0	0.490724998121	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.340945547085	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.453436577946	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.452466777371	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.271894879221	... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
0.0	0.34815903738	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.35913071852	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.356202196291	I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.
0.0	0.52181213022	It's campaign -- a corrupt campaign finance system.
0.0	0.31131249263	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.355636131144	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.330109721625	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.426100814055	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.494527377979	That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.
0.0	0.446161369603	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.292378443382	I think that's a major accomplishment.
1.0	0.490847016083	And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
0.0	0.321550697383	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.40551059246	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.336872294099	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.273994410682	I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.
0.0	0.5790083389	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.411842459882	I was there and I saw the debate.
1.0	0.51186152127	John -- John, this country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.512158286885	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.491813437826	We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.
0.0	0.348548247919	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.445125748209	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.405269470391	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.476297941757	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.199524371899	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.325019349026	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.
0.0	0.430169698018	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.49605615537	So protect the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.392289468217	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.506991660264	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.275815845638	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.323419625414	We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
0.0	0.357447986433	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.491399727809	It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English.
0.0	0.441754528295	But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.408741954316	Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.47488828635	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
0.0	0.464311724618	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.176446460997	You're simply not.
0.0	0.414048829409	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.329959429742	And I watch the speeches.
0.0	0.236427237692	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.343698721577	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.
0.0	0.401747478408	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.380055151523	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.172214148784	It never happens.
0.0	0.237875427227	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.278372260433	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.360393663302	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.555937899753	But at the end of the day, what you have right now are millions of Americans working two or three jobs because their wages that they are earning are just too low.
0.0	0.191452183467	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.221609539821	You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well.
0.0	0.323515164199	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.145873068498	And here's what's going to happen.
0.0	0.493154605508	It wasn't the bill that I wanted, but yet it turned out to be one of the more significant pieces of veterans' legislation passed in recent history.
0.0	0.334644474377	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.505926525759	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.333674574477	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.304127576827	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.31365979268	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.516667130715	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.248239307501	And I do not believe it's a good idea now.
0.0	0.319420511285	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.261668171738	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.383170427497	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.258959843019	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.442522998121	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
0.0	0.405337677863	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
1.0	0.352406426143	I think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street...
0.0	0.318924770672	All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.
0.0	0.214092037746	So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.
0.0	0.377428314082	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.365302192862	You count on it.
0.0	0.458283836658	Their business model is greed and fraud.
0.0	0.279934346674	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.428672992702	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.409031484125	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
1.0	0.552707292123	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.317204922504	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.341201409066	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.0	How about this?
0.0	0.46076934158	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.306931800997	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.355641467772	So the reporter said to me the other day, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person.
0.0	0.27496956638	Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense.
0.0	0.294769732799	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.39344615561	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.444328339102	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.
0.0	0.38809078719	There are many crises that come -- a water crisis in Toledo.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.245795196635	They are not our friend, believe me.
0.0	0.320709286687	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.405334581714	But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector.
0.0	0.155688414656	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.187856261251	Am I supposed to dislike them?
0.0	0.144239135815	They're saying, "Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough."
0.0	0.322915356908	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.278116869413	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.355774595515	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.313267879376	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.219374101442	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?
0.0	0.277226603752	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.344612782345	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.391359542024	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.421399389462	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.25636910381	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.499538351737	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.4114567134	Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them.
0.0	0.238734256415	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.196217306402	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.247739767239	Yes.
0.0	0.389342992547	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.420491662063	It's a disaster.
0.0	0.259242610952	I said, "I don't know."
0.0	0.392128981587	They want American troops back in the Middle East.
0.0	0.333228454524	I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.
0.0	0.415054890604	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.
0.0	0.354810016009	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.0	No -- no...
0.0	0.458198120959	And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.
0.0	0.295888015731	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.441248230563	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.393730954596	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.179455340356	Yeah.
0.0	0.477336830038	Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors.
0.0	0.284230333205	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.626185920051	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.329206207609	The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.
1.0	0.549176862377	Nancy, the blueprint in Maryland that we followed was yes, we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment.
0.0	0.348212489807	... Chris, your questions that you...
0.0	0.452079434799	And all over New Hampshire, I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose.
0.0	0.0	No, you did.
1.0	0.723900118301	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.309989493905	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.469031544596	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.382626967051	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.295942320147	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.395523436163	And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.399076942777	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.410864853094	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.280566175947	Quite likely, for that reason.
0.0	0.309842725392	But it's a lot safer.
0.0	0.395987818236	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
0.0	0.221668892771	They were wrong.
0.0	0.44780662347	And for my part, I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has.
0.0	0.383492639209	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
0.0	0.389021624115	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.422269747023	It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state.
0.0	0.19609130675	And that's what's happening.
1.0	0.727551267139	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.0	OK.
0.0	0.388521942121	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
0.0	0.4317034025	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.412875541033	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.447680427966	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.397661535269	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.322227693937	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.338837531621	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.211122627557	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.348614141379	I won't be doing that.
0.0	0.278004243866	Hillary doesn't want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her.
0.0	0.376639381797	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.331231563913	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.209922923033	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.28252224081	Don't know that.
0.0	0.28603134832	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.225938205222	We're dying.
0.0	0.323116458712	I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail.
0.0	0.355642016533	Number two, we had a really good plan.
0.0	0.320364063827	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.323934847833	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.436800861545	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.22620538818	It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee.
0.0	0.439232970583	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.
0.0	0.325154678796	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.428189530962	That is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.
0.0	0.44454942958	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.0	Both.
0.0	0.397928062121	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.282881835276	I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.
0.0	0.454093090325	Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
0.0	0.446538456611	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.225005307905	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.362774161333	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.137113236824	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.319889852278	But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.
0.0	0.482847120473	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.445190372003	Kathie, this was not merely theory in Maryland.
0.0	0.329062156551	They beat us all the time.
0.0	0.387825921043	The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.
0.0	0.414064963583	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
0.0	0.282321852634	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.38008304671	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.208260482486	I'm running.
0.0	0.273779867678	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.362315664253	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.357560947792	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.426130170632	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.186517952291	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.
0.0	0.374261679773	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.437744062917	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.605237053571	I want the Buffett Rule to be in effect, where millionaires have to pay 30 percent tax rates instead of 10 percent to nothing in some cases.
0.0	0.300109142577	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.305363161226	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.473657465564	I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border."
0.0	0.430622555738	I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures.
0.0	0.433415132422	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.361428768211	He couldn't answer the question.
0.0	0.370467692571	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.187171188053	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.279734568507	I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie.
0.0	0.531576674165	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.425604206635	And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.
1.0	0.723586176856	Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?
0.0	0.522343404477	Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.
0.0	0.500743712248	Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product -- a sign of strength, right?
0.0	0.499608478234	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.375444213267	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.241545116164	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.475585978331	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.509964017546	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.390717100425	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.390046121169	So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe.
0.0	0.227546578126	He said, "You know, I make great product."
0.0	0.37280274343	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.437341021575	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.387600310191	Border security has always been a part of that debate.
0.0	0.192571144319	We hear a lot of good plans.
1.0	0.6710601791	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.226530075083	That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.
0.0	0.478343364817	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.350180430419	I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria.
0.0	0.46557759463	It's one of the key investments we need to make.
0.0	0.49136916867	And I have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run.
0.0	0.221668892771	He's wrong.
0.0	0.482403409846	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.381027286112	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.331215038164	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.391637376325	And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq.
0.0	0.178460408938	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.385193601319	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.202386301041	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.444439871478	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.204640041515	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.339636670931	I am advocating...
0.0	0.467786259336	And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.
0.0	0.490691999187	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.478199392496	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.388480775922	We have people that don't have it.
0.0	0.414602534233	... family leave for a very long time...
0.0	0.412670435878	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.34698751853	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.471156425459	If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out.
0.0	0.463160831971	That means education.
0.0	0.337228654463	I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.
0.0	0.568472244219	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.416434472135	I've had had two town halls, one in Keene, one in Laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do.
0.0	0.490665018689	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.16879745957	And guess what?
0.0	0.389049307654	I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.
0.0	0.599274454011	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.492305134036	But unlike either of these two fine people, I've actually balanced a budget every single year.
0.0	0.235885141281	I think we all support it.
0.0	0.381454050831	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.656562019001	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.309416598118	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.261191693662	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.382272836229	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.509214746537	And, I would not that there's a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that's the EPA's blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline.
0.0	0.372289560994	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
0.0	0.519061742328	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.490342018846	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.349838531272	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.178830666417	I hate to hear it."
0.0	0.446011815896	Got to be on the floor of the Senate.
0.0	0.339577537714	I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.
0.0	0.310179827072	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
1.0	0.786633607385	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.450622529622	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.304857790463	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.608421559941	We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.
0.0	0.511163677904	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.0	Sure did.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.481046865026	Major crisis and primary health care.
0.0	0.277960220213	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.247270945733	Might I respond?
0.0	0.419594184794	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.
0.0	0.382835264174	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.438641836022	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.456594002817	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
0.0	0.322292007068	No, I think they won't.
0.0	0.336680598788	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.30808484096	So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.
0.0	0.22278562719	And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college.
0.0	0.243298621458	We don't know anything about that.
1.0	0.599992018417	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.376495379308	We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.
0.0	0.32841134846	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.370871943308	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.444328321492	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.221417523896	But look, we didn't know what was happening next.
0.0	0.268407171025	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.360801818192	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.310503334147	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
1.0	0.310274871219	They're bringing drugs.
0.0	0.276382125005	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.52833116766	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.373805605871	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.293393045326	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.39756222304	Check it out.
1.0	0.617019593989	That's wrong.
0.0	0.174706029899	So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do.
0.0	0.329856032742	What our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as Americans.
0.0	0.0	But it will be...
0.0	0.3131263176	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.403769518994	This is the election...
0.0	0.540632844761	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.349898856465	I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.
0.0	0.262360773924	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.610222887326	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.455363989127	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.422200141489	I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.
0.0	0.167347294083	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.41375112615	The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.
0.0	0.179455340356	Yeah.
0.0	0.40256610306	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
1.0	0.439060224232	And some of them are like third world countries.
0.0	0.288654485154	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.214513022993	I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.
0.0	0.375289131618	The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...
0.0	0.261797742679	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.491589671776	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.464379852789	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.43509148319	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.304350269698	So Hillary and I have a difference.
0.0	0.352383466367	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.244451336106	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.232627616623	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.372624858071	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.326012827636	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.407702160508	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.379631597089	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.354826138731	...John...
0.0	0.589685620291	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.469231138683	We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital.
0.0	0.374467369301	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.478976428981	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.440813762892	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.266692912489	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.283042628566	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.404959439954	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.339467302969	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.38113539995	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.443613227313	And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty.
0.0	0.427279954113	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.359704032986	It all will be scrutinized.
0.0	0.538900145089	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.356741381422	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.460698782728	People came back from Iraq and Afghanistan without legs, without arms.
0.0	0.0	That's right.
0.0	0.330382900791	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.336950288022	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.322036009834	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.329767898822	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
1.0	0.839456230651	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.390580463492	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.42904109578	We bailed out Wall Street.
0.0	0.443171682108	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.192230056696	And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are.
0.0	0.455759508481	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.373098889508	Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
0.0	0.0	Thank you very, very much.
0.0	0.403535538652	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.342811404867	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.335200120527	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.358855179401	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.391670272824	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.42193649945	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.341439311637	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...

0.0	0.437607982868	And that's only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.
0.0	0.168993855429	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.316573043076	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.301211898045	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.523270405328	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.554995088583	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.507468786239	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.333532977399	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.450815683385	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.435545242851	This group needs to be confronted and defeated.
0.0	0.255357487405	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.377743282652	Then, in 2008, you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying that we don't need those regulations on the federal level and now you're coming back around here.
0.0	0.50711039974	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.353617078683	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.396367776233	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.430142384346	This is a complicated issue.
0.0	0.422045825213	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.280562465769	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
0.0	0.356546408456	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.464363812453	We actually passed a living wage.
1.0	0.3961679243	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.209759418429	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.427831939586	Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks -- between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance.
0.0	0.220960022824	And I -- I thought, if I didn't jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this.
0.0	0.418054220407	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.201059455412	I know the bad ones.
0.0	0.342548639797	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.361091511601	My background is different.
0.0	0.301934191837	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.473300151857	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.248142654147	People that know me, like me.
0.0	0.499111869738	I am proud that I was the first member of Congress to take Americans over the Canadian border to buy breast cancer drugs for one-tenth the price they were paying in the United States.
0.0	0.326977790868	Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate.
0.0	0.30805599293	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.0	Do it.
0.0	0.421847843299	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.432031614126	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.288601094886	We serve you.
0.0	0.356316261683	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.208396743146	I like them.
0.0	0.444958519577	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.248522366662	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.0	It is.
0.0	0.454661613981	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.446636067282	They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.
0.0	0.432019152523	The simple fact is, we all have a record.
0.0	0.387968322399	And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world.
0.0	0.260850538356	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.453137650688	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.154928503927	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.464729461864	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.278940226333	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.339727470512	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.399307705482	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.364327432877	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.370145476969	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.387858158751	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.389050880403	But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.
0.0	0.360193234779	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.488194271389	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.471023686749	A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.
0.0	0.372405108146	That's American citizenship.
0.0	0.31247232555	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.4771991442	I am not the candidate of Wall Street...
1.0	0.585103828366	The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.
0.0	0.593087569421	Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.
0.0	0.24727538889	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.399968371793	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.310803558412	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.353155500568	Get rid of the fraud.
0.0	0.247739767239	Yes.
0.0	0.277305772619	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.442435005359	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.335532261931	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
0.0	0.337404668564	How are these people gonna lead us?
0.0	0.330055698631	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.323049956745	You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.
0.0	0.374096657409	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.274514005133	I learned so much.
0.0	0.306751426479	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.345044001506	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.543041734259	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.39617702475	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.369574119046	I do agree that in particular, Turkey and the Gulf nations have got to make up their minds.
0.0	0.456198444601	He cut and run.
0.0	0.39811471413	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.645142116558	They would have to pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.42951649816	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.275170607128	Let's get rid of Assad later.
0.0	0.235885141281	I think we all support that.
0.0	0.272214303197	So they put together this.
0.0	0.413058015519	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.412062295613	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.352308510674	Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
0.0	0.220058456394	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.304405860267	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.20120935626	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.527791901599	Bill.
0.0	0.560636187823	They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care.
0.0	0.53036040895	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.342975169899	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.194495034139	You know, this is not easy work.
0.0	0.315105543812	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.350980915567	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.388375607853	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
0.0	0.398105249714	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.470359353405	Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.
0.0	0.314790389823	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.230396290028	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.34892626962	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.46847755438	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
0.0	0.286481938285	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.0	...Thank you.
0.0	0.359761012243	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.471927463389	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.0	OK.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.388140312847	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.477205570794	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.438129849503	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.332616161091	And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you're a governor.
0.0	0.353930361621	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.388806596607	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
0.0	0.32938756542	It's time for real substance and real experience.
1.0	0.818709757991	Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.
0.0	0.308877604233	Just can't happen.
0.0	0.393964811066	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.40813362013	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.305177264191	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.29449804853	... issues they have to respond to.
0.0	0.352076946057	I beat China all the time.
0.0	0.366757143207	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.331568687194	We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.
0.0	0.37237746271	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.278463443009	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.404494128357	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.420422537451	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.321171870917	Very valuable.
0.0	0.19309106441	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.312721242005	They kill us.
0.0	0.449351718542	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.479809612084	At the end of the day, if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities.
0.0	0.385798305667	And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.
0.0	0.560090727742	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.432942258416	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.48103874509	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
0.0	0.362342187108	Thank you, John.
0.0	0.305868815606	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.56971680618	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.275611202943	But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand.
0.0	0.437450677288	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.396362341292	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.327653642604	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.447527972273	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.417566927105	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
1.0	0.296910106407	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.289194558523	I heard what they said.
0.0	0.330793049484	Sit down with people like John Mccain.
0.0	0.173232946197	No, I love them.
0.0	0.292616283041	Our vets may see the V.A.
0.0	0.286417749491	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.376464302626	But he used to say, "Donald, don't go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.267788697407	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.379235423491	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.586116601393	As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.347727369096	It was a different situation in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.36191112469	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.347923408356	But at the end of the day, no doubt, the Affordable Care Act is a step forward.
0.0	0.464201964829	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.431701513287	But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.
0.0	0.443522742057	And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it.
0.0	0.28252224081	But we don't know.
0.0	0.373976621915	What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.
1.0	0.696010882115	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.405464065267	Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly.
0.0	0.438778685396	Could we have your support?
0.0	0.28998541237	We have got to come forward with a consensus that in fact will work.
0.0	0.464597051501	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.323876597033	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.482215878778	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.431484770104	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.27208490454	David, let me give you a little bit of background here.
0.0	0.3645434512	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.453549986461	The world has changed.
0.0	0.233868305899	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.404720739409	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.398188354798	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.348583012495	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.570089192409	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.388407422297	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.316032539632	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.378935644309	Today I heard it.
0.0	0.33807021193	So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again.
0.0	0.176797937524	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
0.0	0.431417980491	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.284715695497	We will do very, very well, very, very well.
0.0	0.328237678329	We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game.
0.0	0.445789770547	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.
0.0	0.152791809332	I happen to think...
0.0	0.0	What do we do?

0.0	0.247739767239	Yes.
0.0	0.196115849522	Well, sure.
0.0	0.297932289153	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.415511998403	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.407456329767	I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.
0.0	0.386877545316	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.421535301419	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.193141001936	They thought something was wrong.
0.0	0.422929344536	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.446294457899	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.462914343361	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.31214385354	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.363574960387	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.35840238979	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
1.0	0.566875203171	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.554022772684	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.671288618145	I released 34 years of tax returns...
0.0	0.304663773501	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.559257544073	Seventeen more million more people have health care.
0.0	0.383844261727	And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.
0.0	0.354610112066	It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino.
0.0	0.377544568624	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.404252506011	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.398933463723	And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
0.0	0.261040911698	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.238985621922	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.328437081208	I would prioritize them.
0.0	0.375986149996	The big banks--
0.0	0.523925800936	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.
0.0	0.337524165823	But it cannot be an American fight.
0.0	0.204675670622	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.242218618134	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.354880259566	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.376103837065	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.288706777163	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.413303982512	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.184352545831	You're right about that.
0.0	0.358585422	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.
0.0	0.326977380383	But we came together.
0.0	0.489979451247	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.158816915401	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.419401594575	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.367567177924	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.47494686588	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.343950091336	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
0.0	0.351090820651	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.238597822108	I am glad Donald is running.
0.0	0.368059988754	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.187988465149	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.538462313581	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.350304280891	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.
0.0	0.353215704429	But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible.
0.0	0.511653718574	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.52647552078	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.299077950966	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.209424825725	Now, this is getting to be fun.
0.0	0.455677797811	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.396068013723	They're building up their military to a point that is very scary.
0.0	0.291229842662	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.375516875943	I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.
0.0	0.212513288894	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.44374874941	We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
0.0	0.234154617552	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.303287684487	I mean, that's a fact.
0.0	0.380737103215	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.0	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.268505538241	Can we stop?
0.0	0.188547635758	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.332402441772	I saw Ted Cruz say, "we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill."
0.0	0.439181967807	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.359489202155	It will give hope to millions of young people.
0.0	0.33431460941	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.436863268108	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.296679193512	Well, thank you, John.
0.0	0.311771406791	They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.
0.0	0.31108199132	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.433839666057	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.213886222378	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.0	No, I have not.
0.0	0.423713161401	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	0.415500216669	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.598526322368	It was an investment bank.
0.0	0.422698630955	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.395377588955	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.53002247037	It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.
0.0	0.398986755673	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
0.0	0.219658629723	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.0	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.302690649469	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.495381543055	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.508945855852	First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster.
0.0	0.530788822967	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.361339835849	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.382896855836	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.0	So, I thank you very much for that.
0.0	0.489759405306	This is what's made our nation so special.
0.0	0.382340658398	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.335845697854	You really can't.
0.0	0.512907478464	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.52332204149	On two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago.
0.0	0.24576437494	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.487105373987	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.354082470445	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.377983026553	We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States.
0.0	0.253857330386	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.392442135593	Our next president...
0.0	0.618475456938	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.277581069524	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.443770197105	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.540740741534	Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server.
0.0	0.488207427879	But it was also the cascading effects that followed that.
0.0	0.543922401156	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.0	You know that.
0.0	0.218030500174	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.46302680961	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.49137047775	We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York.
0.0	0.493796815037	My oldest daughter's a teacher.
0.0	0.513102284107	I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.
0.0	0.249446334723	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.397759452961	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.358467199789	Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond...
0.0	0.260130581414	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.277920630955	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.366784619537	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.18688213688	That can be done.
0.0	0.444719842371	We ought to send used equipment, right?
0.0	0.332120867377	There won't be any -- you can get it.
0.0	0.438020053735	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.41225283108	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.295207665844	That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.
0.0	0.33637657806	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.451309333729	He's the greatest show on earth.
0.0	0.464026855246	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.523313871293	End -- end Common Core.
0.0	0.176701047563	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.514221630044	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.486815309027	He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter.
0.0	0.420225847823	We are a better country than this.
0.0	0.413205099013	When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.337689823665	One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together.
0.0	0.29423290877	Does my family like me?
0.0	0.310676064507	And they don't know -- "Are you running?
0.0	0.249921770327	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.474972135408	So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
0.0	0.442201741665	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.283902402336	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.267882026055	Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth.
0.0	0.31614521922	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.27754188169	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.313804984691	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.275826995287	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.411862622247	And we have people that are controlled by special interests.
0.0	0.161305633706	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.330132658489	But I went further than that.
0.0	0.489048652861	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.378833616079	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.470705432034	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.327936822784	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.16571840356	Let it be for everybody.
0.0	0.258722751441	Let's be frank here.
0.0	0.522288910869	Ninety-three hours.
0.0	0.270493923934	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.44079897326	If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.
0.0	0.494225337461	I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department.
0.0	0.42993375451	That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable.
0.0	0.379812673352	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.529365630713	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.467885695711	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.330213054546	The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.349115813243	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.596253821345	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.59764056154	Fifty-one percent of high school African-American graduates are unemployed or underemployed.
0.0	0.34160090829	We don't need more of the same solutions.
0.0	0.538551607905	And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.421598546109	It ain't complicated.
0.0	0.395704849373	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.309827550914	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.0	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.454288801388	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.43143457575	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.276595836949	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.408751134531	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.351045672325	We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.
0.0	0.321725280505	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.425123195023	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.284694501419	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.445435566681	You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization.
0.0	0.392927039716	So, what we want to do is to say, look, we have 11 million people who have been here, many of them for decades.
0.0	0.398986123816	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.31938305764	Well, thanks for having me.
0.0	0.283627629771	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.5194340175	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.464794600608	Two weeks later, the place was blown up.
0.0	0.336921791168	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.509540093678	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.422465674628	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.440436041135	Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, who said my plan for what we should do to reign in Wall Street was more comprehensive and better.
0.0	0.428738505397	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.312156395834	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
0.0	0.456800660375	I believe that our Federal Government needs to do more on pell grants.

0.0	0.439119138718	Germany, many other countries do it already.

0.0	0.2964509962	A step forward.
0.0	0.442142449726	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
1.0	0.695350074275	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.

0.0	0.60784145226	Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.
0.0	0.410091747118	And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.
0.0	0.378720892524	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.32113740005	And I apologize to nobody for that.

0.0	0.465367105338	But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
0.0	0.255780658344	They say, " well, we don't really have control."

0.0	0.297071948369	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.42003622554	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.413579387591	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.341737262696	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.265329249979	All of us believe climate change is real.

0.0	0.0	All right.
0.0	0.0	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.432558038436	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.

0.0	0.306931800997	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.370758518201	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.356414739574	We can't.
0.0	0.473561206534	We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents.
0.0	0.32955138731	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.224299091537	Because now he's going a little bit better.

0.0	0.32264143972	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.462145343478	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.289245301392	So it is difficult.
0.0	0.0	Big difference.
0.0	0.403922013244	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.425108169141	Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons.
0.0	0.438993608065	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.413782902612	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.

0.0	0.453383946295	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.144494755588	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.456632952431	... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.

0.0	0.371061418337	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.436958288686	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.360258301095	Let's quit making it a problem for them.

0.0	0.330748699717	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.44912474326	I also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees.
0.0	0.352554943236	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.

0.0	0.199215634465	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.351074222147	Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.
0.0	0.362842762835	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.378155507796	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.

0.0	0.372031644717	And as our party's nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.435776111296	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.452641519755	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.

0.0	0.32097391322	They're sending us not the right people.
0.0	0.408794262273	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.419620569847	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.450340751423	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.226192894597	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.410331434001	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.330332515772	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.512381892735	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.386268347891	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.330176531914	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.404470418378	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.157931610131	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.309841083676	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.420969145183	We also have to build a coalition at home.
0.0	0.458641775522	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.432231234087	So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.
0.0	0.37909070134	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.341833289638	I don't care.
0.0	0.395657811738	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.322120931296	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.
0.0	0.36942940163	I have formed them.
0.0	0.34365939625	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.364573972841	I gotta build those big buildings.
0.0	0.323058881091	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.535932885279	We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.
0.0	0.252645740077	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.354826138731	John?
0.0	0.354977039944	I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to -- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.
0.0	0.419460813806	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.365305056327	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.
0.0	0.484041839359	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.356828085531	We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.
0.0	0.345120926695	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.328463403268	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.193428988878	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.432443179197	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.347287950138	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.339128995741	it won't happen.
0.0	0.359573929345	So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.39458251462	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.267968617482	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
1.0	0.690791127343	A $5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.419436971783	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.424501179972	And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting.
0.0	0.310515014659	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.391679103622	Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country -- we would never build in an ocean.
0.0	0.31504096407	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.362024404678	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.244726512359	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.243086016678	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.420158163412	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.329582033648	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.36320816551	They are not doing it now.
0.0	0.394718802937	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.361388871679	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.429215619724	I was not the secretary of state...
0.0	0.228063455294	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.459106409117	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.431498007955	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.35288949985	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.300535088897	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.354275758634	It is enormously complicated.
1.0	0.81621068622	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.354386820916	I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.
0.0	0.267978547346	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.419113017149	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.389264146757	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.184704855602	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.41272981162	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.0	But...
0.0	0.234589842382	Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.
0.0	0.334271393989	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.
0.0	0.554065945408	But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it.
0.0	0.0	But I...
0.0	0.411547708217	For a start, they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes.
0.0	0.402241947468	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.359875555803	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.492814403207	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
0.0	0.384749441534	Number one, we're going to keep ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.325699915715	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.157048267818	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.35516448185	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.0	All right.
0.0	0.430274150545	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.416184252539	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.626311103818	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.270625983979	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.372869636998	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.215586151829	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
0.0	0.334698955878	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.414687143317	We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is.
0.0	0.377636914829	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.337094011763	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.195406826317	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
0.0	0.353054209777	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.37989477842	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.
0.0	0.303188175541	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.319553760299	That's a wonderful business model.
0.0	0.428775453403	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.254160018697	We need a collaborative approach.
0.0	0.162952240516	That's what we need.
0.0	0.25510626129	Creativity.
0.0	0.416405972907	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.330109846323	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.379445819035	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
1.0	0.896149579604	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.39751358433	This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.
0.0	0.531841198528	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
1.0	0.687549179066	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.443647410647	A lot of the rights that have been won over years, from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights, will be at risk.
0.0	0.432878300827	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.583971743867	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.325489701997	I've dealt with them all my life.
0.0	0.367144379505	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.635305467392	Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system.
0.0	0.439594294655	It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.
0.0	0.373534545746	So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.
0.0	0.387316137805	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.601412828516	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.52294580998	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.621895135595	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.317925627605	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.397581506892	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.5753728049	Thousands.
0.0	0.473543984068	Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, "Rand, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.275779532145	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.319438519561	We need to rebuild our families.
1.0	0.734938273364	There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign.
0.0	0.247739767239	Yes.
0.0	0.294115087674	I've been to Ferguson, I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.
0.0	0.457202072958	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.404379607575	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.328882333466	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.33723036761	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.343489696974	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.327372222817	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.188743545586	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.
0.0	0.446770255894	Wall Street today has too much political power.
0.0	0.394574495166	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.462555205189	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.184352545831	You're right.
0.0	0.548534797012	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.0	And so do I.
0.0	0.0	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.497714704168	I also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down.
0.0	0.392980559113	They can provide forces.

0.0	0.339128995741	It won't happen.
0.0	0.319530215153	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
0.0	0.406416636025	Sit down with people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the house, and work on a bill.
0.0	0.548074424824	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.

1.0	0.369624291763	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.0	Believe me.
0.0	0.351533473977	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.33195054152	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.526277696727	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.377838256789	They can provide resources.
0.0	0.0	All right.
0.0	0.324664358846	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.210861436884	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.1959397242	But I can tell you this.
0.0	0.270133203326	That's crony capitalism.
0.0	0.473199463551	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.497568878148	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.151944199165	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.295411272801	How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
0.0	0.407072996716	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.409345696527	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.47297311501	They should have made it more open ended for the next president.
0.0	0.427858079187	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.346602971766	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.378376686718	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.415369813638	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.339064159836	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.471580796014	But I have another one, Ford.
0.0	0.192967833319	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.487129660013	First of all...
0.0	0.311384295584	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.344969536988	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
0.0	0.429828065483	And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and I would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go.
0.0	0.347366481323	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.320663772438	David...
0.0	0.544110443379	And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.
0.0	0.338261106639	Neil...
0.0	0.358358058453	And we've got to do more on equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.436808378491	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.390959445762	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.493163726849	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.36320816551	We now have that.
0.0	0.413934679836	This is an emergency.
0.0	0.512330476787	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.404552770794	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.478559658513	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.445374226755	He was putting his 10 and 12-year-old boys to bed the other night.
0.0	0.506861446014	They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?

0.0	0.306931800997	Don't believe it.
1.0	0.558895271563	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.5002745892	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.186141047741	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.391889611299	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.422667996657	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.

0.0	0.279092682818	Obama is going to be out playing golf.
0.0	0.392675522798	And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.
0.0	0.421065595923	Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.428782706196	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.209287270599	Yeah, but let me respond...
0.0	0.259953127418	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.501217769643	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
0.0	0.362332231442	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.380305262567	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.362549455191	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.388857451004	We cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of moral nations around this Earth, we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats, because Martha, this will not be the last region where nation-states fail.
0.0	0.415593311927	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.436477763406	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.302371112633	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.704931003573	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.377379984917	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.0	No their not.
0.0	0.247529402242	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
1.0	0.79780784461	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.316329252871	And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.
0.0	0.481158590701	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.377679333409	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.349351833449	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.308173600831	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.298636392011	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.378459109261	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.232354345114	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.

0.0	0.547781503807	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.330837293072	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.416200766619	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.401357820935	Making fun of disabled people...
0.0	0.412152499175	I think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12 it would be the highest historical average we've ever had.
0.0	0.262614697721	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.610518291777	We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government.
0.0	0.319100044554	I didn't say permanently.
1.0	0.847983698122	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.520422362807	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.

0.0	0.438851809595	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.607628481928	Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent.
0.0	0.408764222043	And most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that.
0.0	0.482683177446	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.232787356733	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.406364560952	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.

0.0	0.346037736323	I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House.
0.0	0.430547221256	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.370763322362	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.407745139502	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.
0.0	0.423075417524	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.345994805511	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.

0.0	0.463356756467	If we are not successful, if we continue the same old, same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big-money interests, nothing changes.
0.0	0.382656147027	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.605517254749	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.0	Right?
0.0	0.52155276455	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.27357070309	We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.
0.0	0.0	Not at all.
0.0	0.442890079997	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.0	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.452338558151	I do respect Rand.
0.0	0.230260736941	That makes no sense at all.
0.0	0.438066784878	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.423191512025	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.310115913834	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.640760990259	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.0	They will not.
0.0	0.292818749893	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.29178710262	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
0.0	0.385815602696	We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love -- they're great -- all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.

0.0	0.0	I have...
0.0	0.431985551685	And so, you go the extra mile.
0.0	0.27146276862	We don't have victories anymore.
0.0	0.197248131447	Excuse me.
0.0	0.396805160364	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.40918978986	When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war.
0.0	0.43179847827	Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.
0.0	0.20719126002	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.424599891521	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.220763269605	And we're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.324908953393	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.21837831879	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.462181534673	The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.
1.0	0.764793538757	And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.
0.0	0.323128458774	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.325317180348	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.297430066825	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.388873078041	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.471695263885	It's a divided country on guns.
0.0	0.168533852615	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.240589634637	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.259802208381	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.36711266739	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
0.0	0.463491437652	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.506880209852	That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
0.0	0.363596250043	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.
0.0	0.216427426933	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.238655269551	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.410953988595	That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive.
0.0	0.437660164692	This will end.
0.0	0.25876022646	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.170138308615	We never dreamt we'd ever see it."
0.0	0.388854695815	I was for legalization.
1.0	0.583011864831	We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.354385471162	Credibility counts.
1.0	0.554601821076	I did introduce legislation to reign in compensation.
0.0	0.234663970203	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.356983848127	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.300530556441	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.37045857557	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.426281230568	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.44354445958	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.
0.0	0.391187024281	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.35596244435	That is the clear and present danger.
0.0	0.467983897965	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.294726521693	We need sound money.
0.0	0.339018501834	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.46620159351	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.300586531697	But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
0.0	0.42714388565	Let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.0	2,000?
0.0	0.256393655523	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.258245122934	We've got to hate the Muslims."
0.0	0.233050440976	I would invite him, I actually would say.
0.0	0.275860012866	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.335931495828	We need money.
0.0	0.25121846433	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.349788005124	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.44136757493	How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years.
0.0	0.225938205222	We're dying.
1.0	0.499562235669	According to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.356879367492	As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.374536458547	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.226888304513	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.356791595377	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.302748797098	And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.
0.0	0.226854827431	We did a lot to help.
0.0	0.289037994191	I said, "Is he intelligent?"
0.0	0.0	That is what we have to do.
0.0	0.34188316451	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.42425474905	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.270552293275	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.352316318445	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.30756988837	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.303473894812	How are they going to beat ISIS?
0.0	0.278454066551	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.502755739095	At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.
1.0	0.644233929742	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.4725429378	But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
0.0	0.310274095295	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.386841759037	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.37140369328	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.451944266424	That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.
0.0	0.45754310392	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.200172409443	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.403674428432	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.385275222713	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.323833347125	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.559332881431	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.388762119552	And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.
0.0	0.34853389569	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.
0.0	0.31190469383	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.344495338789	You don't serve us.
0.0	0.392036039977	I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism --
0.0	0.360396462276	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.353802579261	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.493413959979	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.266267244453	I don't think we're at war with all Muslims.
0.0	0.238091689208	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.428670133203	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.353421259384	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.375599095799	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.464031960236	My patients are beside themselves.
0.0	0.444006480243	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
0.0	0.410315522702	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.371027676351	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.394091463782	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.219700083058	I agree completely.
0.0	0.295252981795	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.439917504714	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.154273316952	It's nice.
0.0	0.335715564843	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.203459428001	We have the opposite thinking.
0.0	0.360521508802	And one of his little boys said to him, "Dad, what happens if Donald Trump wins and we have to move out of our homes?"
0.0	0.42220936383	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.37779193621	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.503068234559	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.136767067941	They're not good.
0.0	0.220809676078	And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
0.0	0.399785749463	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.418495908685	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.392238066323	KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.
0.0	0.3950682799	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.335089411595	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.
0.0	0.554856515599	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.439319392335	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.369542775301	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.4488073972	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.483432447444	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.279003480061	Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.
0.0	0.355211370615	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.242476515562	You get together.
0.0	0.471740642085	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.1959397242	That I can tell you.
0.0	0.539402444157	I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.
0.0	0.417770239581	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.331158864363	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.168347262769	You get a lot of them that are overrated.
0.0	0.437131198029	We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.
0.0	0.38050303724	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.425270529672	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.414632973753	The NSA is another big issue.
0.0	0.286010988143	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.335031724351	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.202029623189	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
1.0	0.677380950261	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.314937049947	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.34987941603	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.446409796822	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.412351867426	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.408070079351	When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up.
0.0	0.364250739242	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.39508953047	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
0.0	0.310604713852	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.0	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.328010853728	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.304288619933	And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.
0.0	0.500918934974	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.269794278844	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.392313514458	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.495159485986	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.372506928493	It is a tragedy all over this country.
0.0	0.343979813957	I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video.
0.0	0.15715611557	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.28839267583	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.295279317695	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.313751438028	We went after those who had attacked us.
0.0	0.441546060712	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.545614971324	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.457641918626	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.257257235238	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
1.0	0.637678559047	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
0.0	0.243581378759	I don't think so.
0.0	0.392964692683	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.385123914638	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.428819116928	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.362378453389	You can -- you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.
0.0	0.402423402838	Man (ph), their mother's here as well.
0.0	0.545394060642	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.414329648526	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.447426897828	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.493384291957	But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks.
0.0	0.404886733218	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.371389455977	Washington is broken.
1.0	0.758173771227	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.406022199075	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
0.0	0.247470102036	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.437217886101	That's a drag on the economy.
0.0	0.446829119857	This entire question was an attack, but that's (inaudible)
0.0	0.269999710981	Those are all really positive developments.
0.0	0.441284362323	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
1.0	0.781895712248	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.388475028464	We talked about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.338686413047	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
0.0	0.253083307976	And that's not what's happening now.
1.0	0.601459875189	People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.
0.0	0.247753285971	There's been no crowd like this.
0.0	0.322885522822	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.244223145075	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.192671087503	Now, here's what is going to happen.
0.0	0.283866395189	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.265321764458	You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America.
0.0	0.493826681018	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.387688473279	And, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like Gadhafi, a despot with American blood on his hands, is overturned.
0.0	0.0	You did.
0.0	0.380591361565	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.571576911555	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.395405200967	There's too much -- it's like -- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
0.0	0.358916128572	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.28166133733	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.301220284449	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.408844988563	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.235302686139	But what -- I will tell you this.
0.0	0.391453431187	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.389186904915	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.475451888689	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.197428543812	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.439169492898	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.395072730412	... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.408661384502	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.394074179797	We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.
0.0	0.357512021916	Fact check me.
0.0	0.262432881322	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.53758292681	He's been a negative force.
0.0	0.405868489772	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.42793678338	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.218758559841	They're off to China.
0.0	0.350667491223	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.320434794714	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.404597900049	On January 20th, 2017, the next president of the United States will walk into the White House.
0.0	0.427954559688	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.628012760806	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
1.0	0.715655949111	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.381178631213	I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones.
0.0	0.514234978276	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.236282205431	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.201785992221	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.376678328778	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.416551274885	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.317211433833	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.683980733214	So the total is $8,737,540,00.
0.0	0.430661579558	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.429482128117	Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC.
1.0	0.514111601801	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.21315392635	Wait for what?
0.0	0.385863220376	We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy.
0.0	0.30378532388	You know why three?
0.0	0.361280472909	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.457563133836	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
0.0	0.346693686173	I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.314433614517	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.401953218678	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.240374711785	Whoever heard of this?
0.0	0.330828359521	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.363023877994	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.38934448121	The central question in this race is trust.
0.0	0.426570034773	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.46856942832	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.26033779575	Well, they're glitches because...
0.0	0.431089713894	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.0	That has not been...
0.0	0.242323248887	I'd suggest people take a look at it.
0.0	0.417750007708	White people?
0.0	0.332698011016	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.355220449722	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.424324616078	Marco opposed this because they made a deal.
0.0	0.364151673925	One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this, is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations.
0.0	0.158712398954	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.382472864774	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.700362594439	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.450251731876	Some of the bravest people that I had the privilege of working with as secretary of state were our development professionals who went sometimes alone, sometimes with our military, into very dangerous places in Iraq, in Afghanistan, elsewhere.
0.0	0.320242990842	But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.
0.0	0.19369697835	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.328258352606	Well, I would just repeat that.
0.0	0.180424313975	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.366211357539	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.487641103987	We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
0.0	0.467103972735	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.397357245244	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.427268199454	Parents, and sons, and daughters and family members, and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them, we must remember this, that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century.
0.0	0.388781644276	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.327378790134	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.47489148935	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.241935384257	I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary...
0.0	0.439449501222	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.188693042241	And I've been there.
0.0	0.35313012008	We must able to work collaboratively with others.
0.0	0.479332793469	He's actually a negative force.
0.0	0.411859959209	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.470815208389	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.467426545312	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.272448257794	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.226143543748	We've gotten off the Hillary's e-mails, good.
0.0	0.212115924889	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.446256923569	And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details.
0.0	0.297075788038	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.242670669254	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.261423188905	Somebody said -- thank you, darlin'.
0.0	0.365857587013	... we will secure the border...
0.0	0.442826105687	Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground.
0.0	0.501772779943	This is not the type of campaign that we run.
0.0	0.475496414185	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
1.0	0.591489871603	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
0.0	0.429448639608	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.403315195562	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
0.0	0.281983977502	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.418257927361	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.19514266621	I just want a job.
0.0	0.24532402269	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.414635291074	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.471801239038	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
1.0	0.830031096351	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.363509294452	Go on to my website.
0.0	0.143984952821	You're certainly not very good.
0.0	0.394516168455	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
0.0	0.252392828859	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.413634482555	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.294064798107	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.404763851423	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.323352040549	And there are many ways of doing it.
1.0	0.861387814725	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.322602403253	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.19335050678	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.420501311711	... and I think -- you know, Governor -- Jeb, you -- the attack that -- the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS.
0.0	0.243581378759	So I don't think...
0.0	0.237536369302	Absolutely.
0.0	0.160508986942	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.265855243568	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.32719329552	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.334964927319	But this is what we also have to say.
0.0	0.406035228715	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.432603207429	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.378191892643	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.432342802946	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.252618059945	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.39012921875	And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.
0.0	0.340495577594	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.278402013774	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.340430456717	May I respond to the critique on the ...
0.0	0.252744508971	I love China.
0.0	0.338766022644	He undermines it.
0.0	0.46287401372	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.389296234551	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.498473381915	First priority, destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.413607483438	And we ought to fight them on that level.
0.0	0.297549383183	I would change them.
0.0	0.339661466059	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.188478061205	Wow.
0.0	0.472020292891	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.373345391963	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
0.0	0.422462525144	Wall Street is a threat to the economy.
0.0	0.195085729645	Who are we kidding?
0.0	0.188478824572	Please go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.32899045711	And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.
0.0	0.237536369302	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.319455643505	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.
0.0	0.286921621545	We don't need that.
0.0	0.382311742635	And the world, no doubt is a better place without him.
0.0	0.287215947689	It goes away.
0.0	0.304030068328	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.444145574428	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.168057947258	Yes, I'm getting...
1.0	0.849597150724	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.321543354983	How has it worked?
1.0	0.604138361069	And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions.
0.0	0.481742228647	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.291545095092	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.
0.0	0.369491767741	They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.
1.0	0.63668885915	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
0.0	0.279686459987	I gotta do it, Dad.
0.0	0.255006851332	That's the good news.
0.0	0.378592035812	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.35344947899	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.43994283011	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.460033239779	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.4429937892	And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.
0.0	0.320520901822	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.436407953996	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.385364104422	She's an American citizen.
0.0	0.376540021626	I didn't inherit any money.
1.0	0.426425800069	We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.436491231492	As president, I will support law enforcement and we'll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community.
0.0	0.419247445466	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.414711922342	And he asked me to support that.
0.0	0.137299709638	I think what is...
0.0	0.652242921232	Real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years.
0.0	0.447045168702	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.340015892348	He can't have it both ways.
0.0	0.350563559492	You can't be in favor of defend us...
0.0	0.323914001854	We need new leadership.
0.0	0.363917907848	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.358364473442	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.301948203655	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
1.0	0.825825142921	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.374514185274	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.353850477394	And, here's what she said to the American people.
0.0	0.338591288716	One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy.
0.0	0.39299433018	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.508827413369	No, both the federal and a state approach.
0.0	0.277751559558	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
1.0	0.727732728648	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
0.0	0.405539461548	And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
0.0	1.0	No, it's true.
0.0	0.296199889589	I give a lot of money away to charities and other things.
0.0	0.305614129253	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
1.0	0.787425269845	Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.
0.0	0.275855126713	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.41301607135	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.299241449177	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.590501700267	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.327681117033	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.418145141639	Can I share this quick story?
0.0	0.44153695913	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.524870184696	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.0	I do.
0.0	0.4300561663	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.
0.0	0.402572222138	And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.
0.0	0.446705967709	And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.
0.0	0.303206077922	Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said.
0.0	0.415140609883	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.295936818005	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.333692098462	You know, Ted didn't show up.
0.0	0.374824073666	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.409941163554	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.
0.0	0.203233547871	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.179907562657	You find me...
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.381477133082	They wouldn't be there except for us.
0.0	0.394164396828	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.297750483306	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.548075578954	We ended up with 56 votes.
0.0	0.399271356902	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	1.0	I never said that.
0.0	0.335651977119	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.425910008361	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
1.0	0.712048131889	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.468810551914	That is the issue.
0.0	0.24409747907	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.25130364366	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.422887725424	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.388499610185	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.274990363965	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.347576620423	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.3591594217	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.468608768027	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.367513425972	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.235644603702	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.346591142972	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.330263589862	What would we do if this were ebola?
0.0	0.329941362687	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.533163329261	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.563354313987	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.
0.0	0.25290033846	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.362863982343	If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs.
0.0	0.260157133775	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.44561293066	I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.
0.0	0.374811560351	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.293215079958	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.396483620704	A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.
0.0	0.423719816606	The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign.
0.0	0.449951276276	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.444452816322	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.407476015649	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.277517648247	We have tremendous people.
0.0	0.370736436589	And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.
0.0	0.248313513234	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.483739889036	Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems.
0.0	0.285361302952	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.395253361372	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
0.0	0.393515108183	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.421816015099	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.389150578285	You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country.
0.0	0.46263674105	That's fine.
0.0	0.43369849804	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.322153507014	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.168533852615	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.34169430786	We haven't.
0.0	0.463571754191	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.406688056895	These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy, and our economic power in alignment with our principles.
0.0	0.167447304279	I'm ready.
0.0	0.145729081997	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.342797836212	We have to come together as a country.
0.0	0.63815016301	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.428859617752	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.32747810719	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.369761937504	I'd sign that executive order.
1.0	0.779251203094	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.490231609245	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.287368791408	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.371506176441	So I believe that, in fact, this country needs to move towards a living wage.
0.0	0.395216453574	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.30378532388	You know why three?
0.0	0.430242790802	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.216906470989	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.277746512239	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.
0.0	0.268831492934	I like China.
0.0	0.470863867687	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.
0.0	0.452515717669	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.308332266084	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.388013388539	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
1.0	0.722956294497	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.313955399545	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.456550881485	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.
0.0	0.397717741884	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.292872158271	I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.279227037555	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.268796751542	I've had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say, I don't agree with you on everything, but I like what you do.
0.0	0.404735031349	Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees.
0.0	0.402239629757	They will be our early warning signal.
0.0	0.226871567772	I'm the only person...
0.0	0.426864626348	I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart.
0.0	0.302239673247	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.438786421483	And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians, who are also flying in that space.
0.0	0.184480923907	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.370774789724	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.385680430774	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.227611310296	Let's...
0.0	0.318156756954	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.
0.0	0.349762277623	I believe that the goal should be debt-free college.
0.0	0.450619834993	But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.
0.0	0.432559407828	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.404782614699	Got to go to Haiti last year.
0.0	0.0	But actually I am.
0.0	0.372952234263	Yes, and it was the same one that President Obama made.
0.0	0.475780842931	and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States.
0.0	0.251889823576	Well, I did.
0.0	0.583479476347	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.516053029398	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.315096985827	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.380588521704	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.467024928066	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
0.0	0.397807609685	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.329518487491	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.372121093752	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.415081869319	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.441451556312	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.397115260209	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	1.0	Of course.
0.0	0.583572779475	And that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums.
0.0	0.49121683234	First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty.
0.0	0.392345621216	So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
0.0	0.611251062792	Trillions of dollars have gone from the middle class and working families to the top one-tenth of one percent who have doubled the percentage of wealth they now own.
0.0	0.468989169903	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.428178289638	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
0.0	0.501771962649	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.443605300331	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.425522218448	Right there, right next to the plant.
1.0	0.631589879104	$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work.

0.0	0.432106219648	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."

0.0	0.369283670136	We have people that aren't working.
0.0	0.323247339766	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.329999360635	They sweated like dogs.
0.0	0.319686313927	... and I encourage everybody watching this tonight to please, acknowledge that by going online at martinomalley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism.
0.0	0.447071876536	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.

0.0	0.261989596436	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.41738965996	John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL, and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.327173464512	Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president.
0.0	0.0	We actually did it.
0.0	0.391298774209	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.

0.0	0.366608579658	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.461713581451	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.335023101033	I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college.
0.0	0.362194384924	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.434516502171	Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.
0.0	0.387388359425	So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has.
0.0	0.303651351704	... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message.
0.0	0.263119662824	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.390981729854	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.271019589672	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.216219597809	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.346104752327	I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.
0.0	0.422735873679	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.402793760818	And, of course, I met the mothers of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, and Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and so many of them who have lost their children.
0.0	0.444990502149	In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men.
0.0	0.43625015206	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
1.0	0.56570402499	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.444637179312	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.352998266765	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.0	Here's what I believe.
0.0	1.0	That's not true.
0.0	0.327736717477	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.
0.0	0.426213662015	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
1.0	0.657017284026	We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.
0.0	0.290110156066	They have no choice.
0.0	0.459239078905	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.458478474177	They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.
1.0	0.741778773518	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.329403524989	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.
0.0	0.315524214787	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.286791453418	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.457210035459	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.457632054456	We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force.
0.0	0.177999067698	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.243581378759	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.321106420211	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.409990872573	Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
1.0	0.508808513615	But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works.
0.0	0.427533802205	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.327974062978	Good company.... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in -- and I wouldn't even use -- you know, I have -- I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
0.0	0.364995505434	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.353417620749	Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy.
0.0	0.2990901134	So I said, "That's OK." I'm proud of my net worth.
0.0	0.16879745957	And guess what?
0.0	0.366175222816	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
1.0	0.640034201754	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.584452707718	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.272597361536	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.35417308507	That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities.
0.0	0.451410365122	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.252156707789	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.269414688421	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.28252224081	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.618430897592	If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.
0.0	0.448414232057	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.198347246546	Well, I think it's pretty clear that they know that I will.
0.0	0.317743974031	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.339014607288	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.278434284563	You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.
0.0	0.356414739574	They can't.
1.0	0.429739570542	It's never below zero.
0.0	0.42909708926	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.379660378651	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.252744508971	I love China.
0.0	0.362517394164	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.419170929985	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.327725604421	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.329107982165	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.530903666331	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.293455761808	Well, I mean right here.
1.0	0.511136303013	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty, and we're the only country in the world -- virtually the only country that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.500014383537	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.468899143893	You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
0.0	0.500573000188	So there's more to my plan than just the cap.
0.0	0.413601272715	The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.
0.0	0.432872406873	In terms of Wall Street, I respectfully disagree with you, madam secretary, in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth.
0.0	0.337455152818	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.380221366578	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.361696117144	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.441478038437	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.420520867074	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.404598473607	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
0.0	0.354479949238	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.342603659321	Sadly, the American dream is dead.
0.0	0.34326992596	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.37610758809	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.15957135969	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.377850993466	I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up.
0.0	0.360174074852	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.440792096178	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.578954598196	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.398292660171	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
0.0	0.513867208548	And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.
0.0	0.396277651594	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.226961890793	How stupid are they?
0.0	0.375052408302	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.
0.0	0.382684206165	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.317472038622	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.396494012651	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.256867845469	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.520063180066	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.342525468937	All of you in Iowa, I need you to caucus for me.
0.0	0.551344603956	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
0.0	0.531039329447	Millions coming out of school as you indicated, deeply in debt.
0.0	0.425017200813	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.480773061718	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.3294198042	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
0.0	0.425124554062	It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
0.0	0.194741786831	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.303503720768	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.394294741588	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.343869351255	The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
0.0	0.44552001134	Rebuild the country's infrastructure.
0.0	0.452173977562	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.390838886489	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.283925629239	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.345117400063	We saw that in Egypt.

0.0	0.171446820026	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.225422614044	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.352671255279	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.401237243648	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.380771244378	Secretary Clinton is right.
0.0	0.409376682164	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.455201349864	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.28029103065	I want security.
0.0	0.364813986824	For her convenience.
0.0	0.384088535036	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.378900384254	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.33824588733	Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody.
0.0	0.299857216712	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.428274089127	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.294184653176	People say, "Oh, you don't like China?"
0.0	0.490392211495	Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers.
0.0	0.246175468482	Look at my family.
0.0	0.428796590812	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.45299890915	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.269120183458	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.

0.0	0.401386441039	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
0.0	0.305971838879	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.390908508448	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.300824865317	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.344820571222	Afghanistan is a mess.
0.0	0.295579029488	You've got to be on top of it.
0.0	0.380484550275	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.
0.0	0.211329684874	What are you going to do for my kids?
0.0	0.5483563804	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.357897953964	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.301121953596	That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.
0.0	0.334412569252	We'll be filing it right on time.
0.0	0.47907407916	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
0.0	0.304074208126	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.171920145193	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.392699664905	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.27723095837	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.344305906589	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.338798749293	They like to ask direct questions.
0.0	0.350025785072	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
1.0	0.587514656956	And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent.
0.0	0.24222071629	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.312616222353	No interest," because I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.517318992391	And it has three parts.
0.0	0.469574110007	I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.
0.0	0.334048980261	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.444436742236	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.387333086192	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
0.0	0.381372842254	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.37526806115	Did a couple of cataract surgeries over Christmas holidays.
0.0	0.416293965177	I don't know and with all due respect to the secretary, Wall Street played by the rules?
0.0	0.158679671792	But you know what else they're anxious about?
0.0	0.511150267586	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.354050044073	It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably -- probably -- from the Middle East.
0.0	0.411787023017	That is why we need to make police -- and I speak as a former mayor.
0.0	0.334504175705	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.486167465196	I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.
0.0	0.441653207397	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.488741027147	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.194905582217	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.346529117543	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.191484592498	But I learned a lot.
0.0	0.590089756183	They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.
0.0	0.415589543811	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.348889081908	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.277873866424	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.0	I would just...
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.323941457946	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
0.0	0.303429164881	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.333577816099	I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.
0.0	0.364779403018	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.413505433273	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.343635286928	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.284859437701	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.403821516925	The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court?
0.0	0.42550131744	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.266939046842	And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.
0.0	0.254178989951	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.137299709638	Think about it.
0.0	0.417319336273	The endorsements that I'm proud of are conservative leaders like Dr. James Dobson, and over 700,000 contributions nationwide, people going to our Web site, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.441444512509	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.55015102233	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.31597914611	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.395754256245	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.31867842211	And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that.
0.0	0.497882319602	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.279139726487	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.402212668557	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.4998647502	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.213076007211	So I would say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.180077596416	Go on to martinomalley.com.
0.0	0.3769215432	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.328278508381	So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there.
0.0	0.239499835223	But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything -- everything, they got away with it again.
0.0	0.322533581845	But states need to do more as well.
0.0	0.429447997361	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.453135774831	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.186226468945	He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, "No interest."
0.0	0.251466307105	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.435509587776	Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.
0.0	0.391102798544	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.379863065958	Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take.
0.0	0.443324158015	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.417313362269	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.479585517371	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.3690564272	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.235068562348	Let me just...
0.0	0.275303941959	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.376619615762	And it's impossible for our people here to compete.
1.0	0.289556868501	We owe Japan more than that.
0.0	0.259802208381	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.187249510634	There are thing that can be done.
0.0	0.19309106441	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.371945095146	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.40389616518	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.367319138925	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.142849502465	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.312055459762	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.483430583886	I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...
0.0	0.272057138653	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.
0.0	0.277406604837	But let's be clear.
0.0	0.427642872725	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.427838761591	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.259633562143	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.22522667196	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.544507091031	Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.
0.0	0.492920994295	... and 85 percent of gun owners agree.
0.0	0.205632457312	You looking at me?
0.0	0.187569661393	I understand.
0.0	0.289724538091	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.582977390786	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
0.0	0.344337348311	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.252027249515	So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.
0.0	0.399590751107	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.475989974282	Against the Republican leadership, who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies.
0.0	0.381352771301	Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.
0.0	0.466833468018	What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years.
0.0	0.450014826362	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.128188832468	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.227411352719	Does anyone know this?"
0.0	0.395710776725	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.367456949652	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.541924180109	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.402338072606	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.403429292876	I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider.
0.0	0.424057110722	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.
0.0	0.347355291927	It's very important we operate on both at the same time.
0.0	0.423679200002	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.261101832008	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.201621525151	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.337565236515	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.472344774752	You have all of these disastrous airports.
0.0	0.453035137431	A few days ago a similar incident happened.
0.0	0.302887124937	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.486279825665	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.553941248784	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.463887731443	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.311202287927	And he is a proud American Muslim.
0.0	0.406893385724	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.329447895724	It's not a bestseller.
1.0	0.456454758693	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.273090353696	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.313821652507	Wait a minute.
0.0	0.356414739574	We can't do it.
0.0	0.446604890674	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.
0.0	0.158444754747	Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.46064588943	We can end welfare for those here illegally.
0.0	0.328945571949	We can build the fence.
0.0	0.16866131309	I'm getting to that.
0.0	0.321255567078	And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party, but of President Obama.
0.0	0.445754892538	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.423428177931	It's virtually useless.
0.0	0.199922900943	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
0.0	0.426853526828	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.355751512526	We actually took action to do these things and as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families.
0.0	0.386446005882	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
0.0	0.302608328983	I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.
0.0	0.366244362501	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.

0.0	0.301882507743	He'll say, "Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico."
0.0	0.304146969646	And I hear their speeches.
0.0	0.157988517853	Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.
0.0	0.482690301892	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.37759543668	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
0.0	0.17653534509	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.41832814455	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.294765099876	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.297748347693	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.353701732201	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.413261942736	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.308926227661	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.196399721195	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.31258334925	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.447957433041	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.293858828126	And there is a lot we can do in college affordability.
0.0	0.294726521693	We need sound money.
0.0	0.295470557621	Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid.
0.0	0.36482467394	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.5884808234	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.293363925681	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
1.0	0.797894215219	ISIL videos, ISIL training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in America is at a gun show.
0.0	0.165285568981	We have to do something.
0.0	0.395642558204	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.320393819665	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.217698266049	And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.
0.0	0.453650452725	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.303395769835	It -- it doesn't need to be that way.
0.0	0.268665533827	I'm tested.
0.0	0.384776073731	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.515575025461	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.279522084527	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.2524235831	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.471222236845	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.532244574836	They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.
0.0	0.557784058791	Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.
0.0	0.137299709638	I think that is...
0.0	0.3544222956	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.389517708888	We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.339754176066	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.400397623978	We have people that have no incentive to work.
0.0	0.430579379456	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.302507044897	When you come back to me, I'll share that story.
0.0	0.416898036974	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.269640138237	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.284971054812	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.389114015346	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.372632719321	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.60148850449	And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.64812852987	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.384956718637	And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.
1.0	0.538736827125	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.354856935163	David, I am the very first...
0.0	0.313625550674	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.374243362279	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.456467865139	From top to bottom.
0.0	0.376478927315	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.630502088848	We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations.
0.0	0.322560213308	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.
0.0	0.457228289806	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.214752572097	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.285872275126	She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.
0.0	0.322868089445	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.292268229273	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.431578009219	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.402967849257	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.446109609189	I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.
0.0	0.473289019111	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.241627928678	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.545478150452	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.306303846768	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.38752463003	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.699126622103	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.388543241078	Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice.
0.0	0.361779257825	There is a vacuum.
0.0	0.265539998232	Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months.
0.0	0.361439229565	And America's best days are in front of us if we move forward together.
0.0	0.303460879446	And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.
0.0	0.425520075563	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.
0.0	0.218203052476	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.352254881851	... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before.
0.0	0.399047430075	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.395791447262	Terrorism in this country scares everyone.
0.0	0.407921683246	We can in fact create jobs and provide job security.
0.0	0.357632838231	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
0.0	0.386944627316	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.34730406212	Both served.
0.0	0.282981072188	And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.
0.0	0.417324668307	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.434569988178	And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.370501159864	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.380032368838	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.466756117977	I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
0.0	0.318210360647	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
0.0	0.26385395674	Martha, we offered a lot more than they were willing to take.
0.0	0.326743047115	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.347137947883	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.174544378436	And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president.
0.0	0.310221946558	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.654225363706	Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.
0.0	0.446959824324	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.547325709967	And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.
0.0	0.674908513117	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.353402512806	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.254491920133	You learn that threats always change.
0.0	0.28933219231	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.470132070404	I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.
0.0	0.266832310909	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.315523620071	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.441043076486	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.288164967471	I win.
0.0	0.309970964341	So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
0.0	0.453460531887	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.427896821595	But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.45771821724	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.295172403058	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.36194910015	Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us.
0.0	0.33640077697	Our president doesn't have a clue.
0.0	0.349493457585	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.232777181107	And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.
0.0	0.194790288587	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.318602830633	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.
0.0	0.21633176122	I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.
0.0	0.253849431205	It was terrible.
0.0	0.287070610259	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
1.0	0.552830860826	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.548190261703	to save a company.
1.0	0.745186825068	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.261254987468	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.465948819058	I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
0.0	0.456479196818	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.
0.0	0.366702294053	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.511052551393	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.44684878977	And I applaud his record in Maryland.
0.0	0.47171175808	Karen and I have seven children.
1.0	0.427096633784	He's not wall street.
0.0	0.434689666553	I want this bill to be voted down.
0.0	0.337028193979	Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.
0.0	0.351583435399	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.454843366757	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.
0.0	0.404271956721	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.151477829006	I feel like...
0.0	0.260682475835	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.2964509962	It is a step forward.
0.0	0.295364006003	Folks, it's not too late.
0.0	0.387671017522	We have losers.
0.0	0.277915803722	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.262985402626	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.378968627309	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
0.0	0.254978016327	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.256396511925	He's very upset.
0.0	0.529668565082	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.281988786154	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.307246619223	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.40218954839	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.355939404946	And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.
0.0	0.304566444077	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.26067280586	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.221537303236	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.375350667447	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...
0.0	0.403872327094	He said, "we have the military in the streets right now.
1.0	0.489216648026	Well, we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists.
0.0	0.453525458754	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.395976702269	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.411240263223	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.244058098325	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.
0.0	0.337628279553	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.318588520187	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.397576936367	Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity.
0.0	0.311835230102	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.310378733124	I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.
0.0	0.379116843771	But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future.
0.0	0.399263819959	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.347275678588	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.211222386888	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.393071176598	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.27862908949	But you don't hear that from anybody else.
0.0	0.556556344854	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.481020016552	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
1.0	0.437090191073	I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded.
0.0	0.227611310296	Let me...
0.0	0.436176342683	You can go to opensecrets.org and check that.
0.0	0.30509933427	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.476887965798	She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.161091296833	I think he is right.
0.0	0.526026935589	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.0	Good evening.
0.0	0.311642835053	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.438652088356	Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.
0.0	0.0	But...
0.0	0.267102227814	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.342354138998	And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.
0.0	0.152425591816	They're great.
0.0	0.455647520185	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
0.0	0.27255077152	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.414703916303	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.0	We have to do it.
0.0	0.328107791016	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.461321116973	We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
0.0	0.314039099897	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.55792731305	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.360881550319	Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
0.0	0.414490825419	That's the wrong number.
0.0	0.225119598924	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.414172728175	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.404891610846	There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.
1.0	0.584144455065	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.207045867544	...the only reason is -- look...
0.0	0.415778140192	So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act.
0.0	0.390738142324	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.315413044027	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.422902381262	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.131507742086	It can happen.
0.0	0.545104397668	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.272309305654	I have no idea.
0.0	0.389932191627	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.233274580585	Let me just say this...
0.0	0.263557048461	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.495334674336	This nation is the most powerful military in the world.
0.0	0.571044971359	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.393983269414	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.299607086979	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.279046011056	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.313083031359	... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.
0.0	0.29520881614	He believes everything he stands for.
0.0	0.447814473748	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.381775099528	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.164558146446	What sense is that?
0.0	0.414207698463	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.30274896144	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.37965610267	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
0.0	0.122369197551	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.361976687773	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.456450019198	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.253380360031	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.192263484108	We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
0.0	0.452990137548	Mark my words.
0.0	0.452115854004	But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.
0.0	0.354105053499	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.247739767239	Yes.
0.0	0.393775236147	Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.
0.0	0.315332556691	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.412962881813	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.387120933068	And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
0.0	0.405412489473	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.340336859418	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.
0.0	0.386207821331	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.413776183582	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.508665046399	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.501726079014	In fact, if you remember, 50, 60 years ago, the University of California, City University of New York were virtually tuition-free.
0.0	0.246183726049	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.264136119465	That will change everything.
0.0	0.370892109521	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.371050241359	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.43511836214	When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.354183385486	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.366520282913	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.457536101538	John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.
0.0	0.39756222304	Check it out.
0.0	0.445564818324	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.371407726653	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.
0.0	0.338965890299	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
1.0	0.444044778871	Well, John, look, I think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis to leave by 2011, is that an Iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend Iraq.
0.0	0.483306694989	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.228351452519	You want one?
0.0	0.40961878604	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.
0.0	0.0	I will...
0.0	0.438624995307	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.38768449791	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.417710527596	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.313838056588	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.253548500249	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.608506384561	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.209206613079	We're running.
0.0	0.218213379964	If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen.
0.0	0.403660942415	It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
0.0	0.394547616592	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.451066797411	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.268528644819	I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path.
0.0	0.396508711121	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.503430151628	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.415730502655	But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.
0.0	0.411698494434	You are not our adversary, you are our partner.
0.0	0.454456869908	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.620591004753	We defended the highest median income in the country.
0.0	0.343866621926	May I have a chance to respond to this issue?
0.0	0.522799543234	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.475518028376	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.272179054893	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.
0.0	0.388545925507	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.0	That is not right.
0.0	0.347816150813	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.510471819214	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.428823530009	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.36708328801	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.527376113975	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.430291052738	The CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary.
0.0	0.378875644308	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.366995120324	I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.364999743858	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.337672197263	What is the best way to do it?
0.0	0.419396449411	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.476647786642	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.187135330465	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.235068562348	Let me just...
0.0	0.294478773227	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...
0.0	0.220176045103	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
0.0	0.496133557564	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.351947454106	We're rebuilding many countries.
0.0	0.264894804187	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.360885417174	I'm not using the lobbyists.
0.0	0.331523225369	I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.
0.0	0.521191173393	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.275911978957	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.421528265235	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.27577827521	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.427402992803	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
0.0	0.421229660361	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.269554605227	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.191697409919	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.373881999483	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.412303805587	Our country is in crisis.
0.0	0.204029792019	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.370398738488	In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.235636753054	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.47667267409	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.414190310569	And for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.
0.0	0.247739767239	Yes.
0.0	0.323581851269	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.321491611003	I know that because I buy the product."
0.0	0.0	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.394952501722	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.311335188246	And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.
0.0	0.225491046325	I'll keep -- I'll keep heading in that direction, believe me.
0.0	0.380899269101	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.390980422259	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.
0.0	0.415079968833	We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.
0.0	0.293543743827	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.217784735746	Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.
0.0	0.398971906138	Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.
1.0	0.510216471006	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.52224124112	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.152448868982	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.424806218362	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.416201968964	We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.
1.0	0.639354772177	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
1.0	0.661095600269	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
1.0	0.329522789025	They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us.
0.0	0.507866219778	You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks.
0.0	0.403321895228	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.500222454971	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.522584358138	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.301137582522	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.496734911539	Support community banks and credit unions.
0.0	0.323903503498	But they're killing us economically.
0.0	0.441045177696	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
0.0	0.380050731702	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.300826422513	Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk.
0.0	0.379234970218	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.55581195628	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
0.0	0.448969582959	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.351949746718	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.36820075076	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.434374214299	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.538709330768	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
1.0	0.70431159298	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.446262164375	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.470660847329	Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.
0.0	0.414288823185	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.378421793243	He thinks low wages are a good idea.
0.0	0.162952240516	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.467265373884	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.418039490533	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.300700369938	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.182353288207	... not everybody else.
0.0	0.214114615686	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.42497973744	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.403302032343	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
1.0	0.700535834025	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.36213812535	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.0	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.359922891532	I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.
0.0	0.412687998612	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.371875536732	I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.
0.0	0.369354274935	It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.
1.0	0.532557184108	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.192764129317	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.380442519153	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.
0.0	0.406967370348	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.353188890393	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.321271311717	Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values.
0.0	0.391824999717	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.149155046456	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.396128907108	But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.
0.0	0.303348546938	Because we don't want them in and out -- we don't want them in and out of the prisons.
0.0	0.279634768435	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.370401499538	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.0	All right.
0.0	0.377725499128	She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.438683736474	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.356857110257	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.396026940871	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.345859245762	And I have to tell you, I would not want -- if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my health care.
0.0	0.326525773535	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.275633524627	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.320607639926	Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.
