0.0	0.306851512641	If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W.

0.0	0.0586862993543	We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.

0.0	0.196470133931	So, so important.
0.0	0.440373066934	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.227465133266	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"

0.0	0.289072525383	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.0448008069834	You know why?
0.0	0.330145716012	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.70552107515	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.

0.0	0.332413772449	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.471402297028	They're going to take away thousands of jobs.
0.0	0.185655702169	It goes in the right direction.

0.0	0.0903243053669	Well, thank you.
0.0	0.239267062953	We saw what happened in Egypt.

0.0	0.108416179932	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.165870905712	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.201040176708	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.163605927495	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
0.0	0.718625586915	... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.
0.0	0.124917498046	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.0692533910161	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.541596845714	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...
0.0	0.148874829781	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.133228796717	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.202459538994	It's true.
0.0	0.49371070202	We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.
0.0	0.0578370522603	Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.
0.0	0.11346617684	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.140872102179	And they wanted to make sure it got built.
0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.
0.0	0.372458328919	When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.
0.0	0.0361365899004	We can do that.
0.0	0.0826758980942	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.

0.0	0.267117315958	Atlantic City has gone bad.

0.0	0.0450556230985	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.964931723523	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.263080527524	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.289314260182	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.0330123446145	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.459449719413	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
0.0	0.334349637536	That is some group of people.
0.0	0.282884045652	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.264151922407	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.38993361953	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.111995799573	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.0966588609206	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.195851146523	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.27369271625	Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.

0.0	0.0663607736866	Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
0.0	0.723465958514	My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.
0.0	0.0908711805633	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.16649720379	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.348518069752	In all due respect...

0.0	0.266033930085	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.269222418028	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.0932925044962	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.105141613958	I think President Obama has set a great example.

0.0	0.0473873858352	That's a blessing.

0.0	0.0346644039522	We all understand that.

0.0	0.214945402427	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
1.0	0.995156939488	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.0760083331498	I don't think anyone has a magical solution.
0.0	0.221788411769	And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.
0.0	0.22914149667	They can't even answer simple questions.
0.0	0.348518069752	With all -- with all due respect...
0.0	0.290293534684	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.841707241365	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.405172619423	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.395714108971	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.134144551647	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.137709104792	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.635355758717	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.0834330509172	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.196465838631	It is.
1.0	0.999999148463	And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money.
0.0	0.00930350101658	You don't have to.
0.0	0.190846725874	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.211828688828	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.315420219819	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.0361365899004	I can.
0.0	0.366092421798	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.333006935345	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.467082091125	John, I would disagree with Secretary Clinton respectfully on this score.
0.0	0.669280551314	People were just being fined to death.
0.0	0.129949941475	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.111472032818	But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.
0.0	0.382963971532	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.556450003607	People have invested a lot of energy into that.
0.0	0.0820286894428	John, I think somewhere between...
0.0	0.108270475309	I'm running for president, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people.
0.0	0.322520573324	It has too much economic power.
0.0	0.409872833895	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
0.0	0.397425953089	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.0109796198994	I agree with that.
0.0	0.419699615212	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.138855577068	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.0918106977959	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.110144017216	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.306645332612	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.0789660891449	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.258759010959	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.270265221106	Again, Americans murdered.
0.0	0.0358207586208	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.227951118014	That can be done without profiling people.
0.0	0.168016289981	I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.
0.0	0.229324168651	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.421028919742	There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America.
0.0	0.102846787568	It's coming from more than Mexico.
0.0	0.94091913575	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.132264279058	I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination.
0.0	0.396684143989	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.115115217301	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.0923250188167	Fine, I'll take it.
0.0	0.59782537685	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
0.0	0.7219327672	And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.
0.0	0.619098272664	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.187984745078	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.
0.0	0.0390207440324	I will not do that.
0.0	0.654587898829	I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war.
0.0	0.338870988649	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
1.0	0.999985245764	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
1.0	0.994243335649	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.411926606667	I want immigration reform to pass.
0.0	0.322079844449	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.361982603609	I spent a lot of time in the situation room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us.
0.0	0.222838220308	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.163556249795	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.167805384547	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.176291731776	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.0799406974308	So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.
0.0	0.168307125676	We were the first in the family.
0.0	0.134721030322	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.602910373013	The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress.
0.0	0.0302076433259	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.621020541971	It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military.
0.0	0.676357560282	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.330129136465	Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.335430938562	It cannot be contained, it must be defeated.
0.0	0.793761732873	We have a stock market that is so bloated.
0.0	0.28873048541	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.
0.0	0.0930481922664	And, I will tell you, I love my life.
0.0	0.0514751426614	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.0391332409325	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.339055840739	Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country.
0.0	0.0323971250926	We don't want to be Sweden.
0.0	0.0372758284304	That is an egregious act.
0.0	0.217867663666	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.097778318578	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
0.0	0.115574030028	They don't even have a chance.
0.0	0.189020502891	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.2094148656	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.597500650799	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.548446703276	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.176106574479	We must keep America safe from this threat.
0.0	0.21482023832	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.343203233275	All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.
0.0	0.119233350164	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.366291920899	It's one of 15 strategic goals I've set out to make our country a better place by cutting these sort of deaths in half in the next five years.
0.0	0.276565873572	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.114797720676	We need more principle.
0.0	0.120538727839	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.0686493166024	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.26245837537	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.555726295073	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.113166431968	Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted.
0.0	0.262624140965	When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.
0.0	0.0393258653373	They think they are.
0.0	0.0700290683808	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.899212579971	We raised the minimum wage.
0.0	0.735866327667	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
1.0	0.555668141551	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.142928124115	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.124916108445	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.11354055526	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.417691310177	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.574978349415	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.113022856574	I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it.
0.0	0.196465838631	...
0.0	0.129340754001	And I believe he is absolutely right.
0.0	0.080777851966	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.308286907156	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.566702404535	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.281013289405	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.0730519376549	We can't even go there.
0.0	0.00859951636346	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.098566548035	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.074908785258	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.291457794392	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.0140829960182	And he'll say, "Please, please, please."
0.0	0.147173513085	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.813642892251	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.0534922172926	We will be there soon.
0.0	0.196465838631	No.
0.0	0.133890611085	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.173048179679	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.0554626517758	He didn't know.
0.0	0.0646277761468	... and I'd like to respond.
0.0	0.305993347553	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.238609775174	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.355800111933	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.56377604606	We now have a gun on every table.
0.0	0.0415619947556	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.251124966312	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.196465838631	That's it.
0.0	0.186434725266	The facts are are very, very simple.
0.0	0.912518568073	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.043752038816	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.0600193087091	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.231069964918	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.
0.0	0.0907964470879	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.5591738025	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.115843527641	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.0997006331628	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.574639492514	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.0202338301549	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.77594921415	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.311570401406	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.0532937370639	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.
0.0	0.0518814613628	But get this.
0.0	0.5	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.536005434753	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.184550342234	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.0880110307656	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.110389774605	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.907817241253	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.0682032303745	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.323096552354	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.147317342046	He couldn't answer the question.
1.0	0.940709688556	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.193910756537	I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.
0.0	0.0361365899004	We can do that.
0.0	0.13947234403	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.222598648901	And here's the problem in this country right now.
0.0	0.0523504024199	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.108189103293	this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.
0.0	0.390846499738	I've spent my entire life, since I started as a young lawyer for the Children's Defense Fund, trying to figure out how we can even the odds for so many people in America, this great country of ours, who are behind, who don't have a chance.
0.0	0.109037300015	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.0576972169717	Did she do a great job?
0.0	0.244218525182	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.0781869006835	And I think has had a big impact.
0.0	0.190577281738	Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.
0.0	0.40474836081	The Libyans turned out for one of the most successful, fairest elections that any Arab country has had.
0.0	0.241945122342	We need to do it now as a nation.
0.0	0.196465838631	No, no.
0.0	0.40124363154	Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.
0.0	0.307092832105	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.757984028756	Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally.
0.0	0.878036560288	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.0526498925376	The problem is...
0.0	0.873010489939	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.286613724755	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.00386233798043	I was the architect.
0.0	0.594812379184	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.952746507357	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
0.0	0.0670807118584	Listen, we can solve immigration.
0.0	0.418874250181	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.227549233231	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.107215624348	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.303619123477	The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world.
0.0	0.0189686483825	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.5	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.12272300494	I've got five grandkids.

0.0	0.196465838631	And here's why.
0.0	0.347460638117	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.0871141002938	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.204668902026	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.896409470672	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.782086315313	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.645590016914	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.568935536282	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.195386473345	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.0771398410281	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.169479248847	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.196465838631	What do we do?
0.0	0.453415641594	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.349838805332	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.00472982789386	Looking forward to it.
0.0	0.248018492242	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.781197520815	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.156228588036	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.143019745212	I (inaudible).
0.0	0.206538944889	And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.764918808983	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.0406122903567	That's what the political revolution is about.
0.0	0.248507658063	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.249648015118	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.596724902481	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.373866967148	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.287767069376	I never said that.
0.0	0.171405800334	The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.
0.0	0.194164877741	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.208682941518	Now, what does that mean?
0.0	0.427825372402	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.5471019778	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?
0.0	0.581434728652	In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.
0.0	0.153884680173	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.465188617992	We have to end -- education has to be local.
0.0	0.28440133207	As Americans, we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet, but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies, to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability.
0.0	0.212102904909	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.0448008069834	But you know what?
0.0	0.280994884	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.098119046635	It really is important that we go forward on this.
0.0	0.198110849664	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.401739469142	First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, "they cannot have it all."
0.0	0.222535408251	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.
0.0	0.157047158863	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.377408497172	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.102688529318	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.0526540649975	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
0.0	0.0890718120851	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.175935112073	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.154834851177	I say, "That's a terrible story.
0.0	0.479672618411	The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.
0.0	0.521567673621	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.0633178039933	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.115306814137	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.414440900923	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.950338573435	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.146664610845	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.21032383545	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.301545710918	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.235634397968	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.521567673621	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.0674058969381	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.251818671987	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.
0.0	0.207236545062	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.0128122039143	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.0122720688788	I like it.
0.0	0.516718945643	First of all...
0.0	0.0984737614106	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.919250592883	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.663354365911	And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.
0.0	0.0510672488047	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.208520634419	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.0766450161731	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.298431676264	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.396050129972	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.479107164386	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.541212735802	It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested.
0.0	0.156946151428	They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.
0.0	0.544102816483	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.0695544897339	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.438910138445	... and say there is something more important than money.
0.0	0.318967224213	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
1.0	0.596458289633	And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent.
0.0	0.232701818374	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.0529547271893	That would be a disaster for this country.
0.0	0.128387702754	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.149877070105	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.440860329156	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.294133420589	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
0.0	0.174136943362	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.155716483291	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.
1.0	0.996775771873	I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance.
0.0	0.222104193744	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.481715214582	I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.
0.0	0.0605787297754	Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire.
0.0	0.0231812956727	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.0559467500125	We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States.
0.0	0.253873419993	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.550075156713	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.336192177887	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.129228590935	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.123676164716	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.
0.0	0.058067374815	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.181800467447	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.0140952266003	I can't do it.
0.0	0.198262123635	It will be a way of life.
1.0	0.291986316214	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.370686301502	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.286227525437	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.189548055844	We should be supportive of that effort.
0.0	0.591316260106	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.192898031838	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.437119998098	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.0912324502505	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.387911048526	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.248617090356	My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves.
0.0	0.0637201239187	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.194343428856	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.55317605973	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.346598647634	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.517952823243	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.182034368579	Go to YouTube.
0.0	0.131465564991	Yeah.
0.0	0.644631449849	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.75348419873	And second of all...
0.0	0.337608140257	We don't eliminate Medicare.
0.0	0.733528368275	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.0768554279388	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.
0.0	0.216353999149	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.167453041741	I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.
0.0	0.201156139	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.226303665433	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
0.0	0.298324069182	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.283664353925	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.218988902239	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.
0.0	0.0956631305839	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
0.0	0.202750713632	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.435432094424	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.452891729748	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.0585138354014	I think we're at war with jihadists who have --

0.0	0.164819558664	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.238098239917	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.

0.0	0.0768198963934	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.126808204966	I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen.
0.0	0.854469627247	Of course not.
0.0	0.588300868669	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
1.0	0.983017106503	We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.
0.0	0.13681491147	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.125728067135	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.

0.0	0.196465838631	...
0.0	0.622239001888	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.0307380362018	No, Martha, I would not.
0.0	0.0701772980726	There's a lot packed into that statement.
0.0	0.657985187961	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.705208548163	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
0.0	0.372418053183	And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country.
0.0	0.888670476251	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.

0.0	0.705452965155	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.43175852357	Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
0.0	0.128992546384	It's making...
0.0	0.244181997992	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.253253063292	Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.
0.0	0.409458869565	It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.
0.0	0.112922209142	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.563158265228	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.

0.0	0.338722493497	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.457056680715	Because we need money.
0.0	0.138992608545	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.266845514102	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.191467822752	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.12474178699	If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.
0.0	0.249642433919	But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
0.0	0.0741275711755	This is a war for the soul of Islam.

0.0	0.0594313502758	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.0500499762094	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.111083035407	We got it.
1.0	0.94918176071	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.118577784033	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.227385735547	And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation.
1.0	0.999987139212	So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education.
0.0	0.192386470179	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.111488801404	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.111717757796	There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better.
0.0	0.0367471242022	Sure.

0.0	0.157915235578	And we need the right people.
0.0	0.0776419647647	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.154279843125	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.103496754589	And who's compromised and who is principled.
0.0	0.0825893492633	Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
0.0	0.196465838631	No.
0.0	0.142566408952	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.168344371685	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.362361102724	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.253562969092	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.0278131126981	It is not tough talk.
0.0	0.0801910026906	But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college.
1.0	0.348171879695	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.451806584348	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.462325355018	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.291752389765	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.
0.0	0.2807587147	Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago.
0.0	0.14095046114	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.287932669252	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.
0.0	0.175625610346	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.452524697671	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.277640723631	Social Security, which Republicans call a Ponzi scheme, may face privatization.
0.0	0.157621873626	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.401401535728	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.196465838631	Again...
0.0	0.216804768268	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.0326052819848	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.225108766747	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.0736606765012	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.0657102374892	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.926449576085	It's their money.
0.0	0.0919389916489	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.29896512376	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.200067706477	Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title.
0.0	0.0643445287622	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.392507468971	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.177161936525	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.361749201575	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.574604872946	He hit oil.
0.0	0.36669878295	Yes.
0.0	0.300833554034	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.112471703457	They're a scam.
0.0	0.0143236515188	It feels different.
0.0	0.42784231114	Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare?
0.0	0.167425709393	My mother's dream -- and she died very young, but my mother's dream for her whole life was to be able to get out of that rent-controlled apartment and own a home of her own.
0.0	0.0731887734282	Making sure that Muslim Americans don't feel left out or marginalized at the very moment when we need their help.
0.0	0.417091484373	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.05638479698	And they're all over the place.
0.0	0.0167506101142	Not good.
0.0	0.280363775237	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.267513680523	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.
0.0	0.257083892676	But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.
0.0	0.221342887975	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.17278671328	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.22944572838	Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild.
0.0	0.467004103574	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.0210619566622	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
1.0	0.90768982105	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.489427176959	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.825021214814	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.13829678363	Many are in this building.
0.0	0.583227909535	Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.
0.0	0.226140188559	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.579530205787	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.0827095827406	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.374144316682	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.0671748671711	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
0.0	0.508052273846	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.0221254430132	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.121535293034	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.0724491646715	Now I'm not doing that...I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?
0.0	0.25968908618	We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.
0.0	0.0393258653373	Think about that.
0.0	0.221908582492	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.802486474416	We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.
0.0	0.144730877886	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
0.0	0.434546419985	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.25882235251	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.865713918938	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
1.0	0.990928555432	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.382418646584	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.225105922071	You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.
0.0	0.378798797376	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.351567834927	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.194203046046	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.188688062674	But Obamacare kicks in in 2016.
0.0	0.0367208939664	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.362429410593	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.763074908496	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.00711837334038	...Chris...
0.0	0.362095941927	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.177649571356	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
1.0	0.993435285857	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
1.0	0.968239326988	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.0470314412109	That's not fair.
0.0	0.534706714408	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.318708111177	We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.
0.0	0.0267493547572	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.486447527422	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.043752038816	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.00781114077547	We did our own rallies.
0.0	0.131066134575	Okay, thank you.
0.0	0.103376830651	And we should be a welcoming nation.
0.0	0.196465838631	We do.
0.0	0.373817377545	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.579747553919	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
1.0	0.760813809026	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.293548877897	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.0696772052214	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.314389157655	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.2344768045	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.713589879993	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.491872461132	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.184894554114	We were wrong.
0.0	0.685793492682	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.343710917113	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.334061244752	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.132135511667	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.300041167569	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.135697539049	Nothing's gonna get done.
0.0	0.452782698077	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.196465838631	No.
0.0	0.0448008069834	And you know what?
0.0	0.781882446544	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.358842311638	The DNC has hired vendors.
0.0	0.104926957912	I've gotten to do some incredible things.
0.0	0.199270733785	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.427592494743	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.363485767349	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.330069017785	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.137678973071	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.141633054658	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
0.0	0.122321128267	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.0155566651795	As a Catholic, that's what I want to do.
0.0	0.346751850675	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.285266151599	Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.
0.0	0.250711417069	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.196937840011	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.772040736766	When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it.
0.0	0.600469640067	The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.
1.0	0.999995936792	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.166615357698	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.184574690729	I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here...
0.0	0.150762408197	I -- I believe that we should make community college free.
0.0	0.0230646604191	It's a joke.
0.0	0.0735809316909	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.336957248488	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.890876813363	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.624874555642	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.45648115136	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.022381665624	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.241375723498	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.217579704837	It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them.
0.0	0.0837410326063	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.114658005229	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.0839149419519	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.140254470007	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.142320237791	I was there in '89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.
0.0	0.0526498925376	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.312433421977	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
0.0	0.0526498925376	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.119101696564	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.976300350456	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.0608769609832	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.546397811789	But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.
0.0	0.220058369371	But I was born here.
0.0	0.116618883229	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
0.0	0.279490099821	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.155328499863	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.382195252641	(APPLAUSE) They're trying to prevent people from registering to vote.
0.0	0.264428841156	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.192176771741	I said, "They send it back?"
0.0	0.201846904272	He got lucky with fracking.
1.0	0.799389193661	Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof.
0.0	0.206207135966	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.124997128796	I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena.
0.0	0.906326990943	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.570122124901	That's the secondary issue.
0.0	0.0649399290098	You have a problem with ISIS.
0.0	0.189776862175	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.
0.0	0.280569812783	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.0330003638613	OK?
0.0	0.234240884473	In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston.
0.0	0.255300433304	And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.
1.0	0.994978783392	Very few children.
0.0	0.0761369476829	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.576231025899	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.0598693665959	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.120023567291	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.32211767316	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.435871075711	And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending.
0.0	0.216100621775	You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?
0.0	0.266587349413	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.0242765515884	Oh, great.
0.0	0.196465838631	She did.
0.0	0.0102693678763	How great is that?
0.0	0.0297952396784	I hope those are the issues we'll discuss.
0.0	0.287622338231	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.104085368605	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.160292945579	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.275758012964	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.167872664967	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.350440187792	Well, you know, governor, I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010.
0.0	0.144141878389	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.212359560248	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
1.0	0.492068647273	It was below zero.
0.0	0.112652497488	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.218792549167	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.127972810069	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.193488845839	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.231044778009	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.0891825388836	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.
0.0	0.643631665501	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.390145822182	It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control.
0.0	0.393426990304	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
0.0	0.863651729494	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.0102693678763	He does great.
0.0	0.487369513297	So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out.
0.0	0.959300285739	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.177145788089	Barack Obama wants to change America.
0.0	0.145254932396	... (inaudible) opening statement.
0.0	0.294992818256	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.13106080635	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.551405911695	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
0.0	0.202080993013	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.490195625464	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.0461652665465	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.319265562934	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.262043456393	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.223946634154	I'm not using donors.
1.0	0.999999596977	Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education.
0.0	0.0692607061509	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.273151158477	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.531901406335	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.317651534076	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.103462677693	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.178198254336	I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace.
0.0	0.23347190043	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.587091831308	And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.152752411304	And your point is absolutely well taken.
0.0	0.686982029638	When you ran in 2000, you said that we needed federal robust regulations.
0.0	0.0628191017714	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.122910256829	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.653061026358	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.164408295305	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
1.0	0.679049261322	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
1.0	0.403666023329	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.0280196761794	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.239328767465	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.330748350955	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.405950075599	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.105992936772	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.38555153359	We both made the identical promises.
0.0	0.144669914624	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
0.0	0.0397011243209	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.757054651041	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.752356548646	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
0.0	0.100435546077	Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS.
1.0	0.88836095372	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.252834706533	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.341050147723	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.0728365898261	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.0634228497618	They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).
0.0	0.230581722922	And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.123681658204	We now finally are where we need to be.
0.0	0.922050380626	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.32834724874	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.427424127794	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
1.0	0.999993352206	I lost that election by three percentage points.
0.0	0.11237491434	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.0340132439241	We have no borders.
0.0	0.288014980201	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.523119471724	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.405269713644	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.0680337851888	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.293238756762	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.124150946487	And it's just not going to work.
0.0	0.278513066826	I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security.
0.0	0.19155048776	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.396667540546	This is revolutionary for education in America.
0.0	0.159043549867	And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?
0.0	0.321241043632	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.541063483693	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.0924307122013	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.27266643265	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.249121872494	Like, I'm standing here, I -- I watched the video of Senator Cruz.
0.0	0.0715856975562	What a brilliant idea that would be.
0.0	0.0987908989436	Because I've seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime.
0.0	0.540232904652	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.131465564991	Yeah.
0.0	0.119360806979	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.0448008069834	So you know what?
0.0	0.45615257412	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.645816303803	But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
0.0	0.243438214257	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.152637999915	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.524186696402	Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
0.0	0.348131076578	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.236146560198	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.00930350101658	No, they shouldn't.
0.0	0.00666479262646	It's not crass.
0.0	0.269375005599	Bill after coming home from Japan, flying 33 missions.
0.0	0.196465838631	This is 2016.
1.0	0.0579388442081	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.13553761503	But not for us.
0.0	0.507236600658	So I believe that over the next few years, not tomorrow, but over the next few years, we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.109339230926	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.222656315652	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.111943360958	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.179400381411	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.521666144998	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.520570418477	And people are saying, "What's going on?
0.0	0.282492206189	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
1.0	0.996212825882	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.984071422558	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.0271994745349	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.0333645728913	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.185264229838	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.178314821115	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.111137967354	They serve in the military.
0.0	0.0108035878073	You're welcome.
0.0	0.287108853147	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.800862896148	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.318540719675	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.116590394893	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.441867813062	And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't."
0.0	0.0664567307418	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.386734663864	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.244595318284	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.

0.0	0.494311479342	I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here.
0.0	0.243456546415	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.281051065791	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.197590675746	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.

0.0	0.293991889411	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.16047686632	You can't hide behind parliamentary tricks.
0.0	0.359656503994	We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party.
0.0	0.0448008069834	You know why?
0.0	0.217326340609	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.657913955239	So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.
0.0	0.26381646127	The Obama administration.

0.0	0.0915857664291	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.426327851918	He said, "Yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.103526698401	That is exactly...
0.0	0.111344292158	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.126517296072	Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope.
0.0	0.71652499102	Who denies that it is crazy...
0.0	0.108872552353	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.665063870717	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.0346470344553	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.136833387942	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.614514753297	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.159361565746	What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy, and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need.
0.0	0.552928335591	Tear down the EPA's blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates.
0.0	0.490068803729	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.274822568007	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.0966847807566	I'll say this.
0.0	0.0139596275788	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.104061950243	My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.
0.0	0.420129081366	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.

0.0	0.904354248959	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.22736666218	But those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort.
0.0	0.0999948210621	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
1.0	0.679667987893	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.531073334186	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.0911355964805	As governor, we continued to work together.
0.0	0.19539585473	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.465777679355	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.419257351138	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.0620375320072	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
0.0	0.474375784627	So, your original question is the right question.
0.0	0.218197397826	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.0830402282941	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.153054198411	... What was your question...
0.0	0.878036560288	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.0108948249329	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.945547677864	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.20599487453	Dynamically.
0.0	0.903104259842	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.59646801377	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0520083393074	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.0143790428101	It sounds crass.
0.0	0.574183676963	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.0672909656828	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.138292808819	But I would add this.
0.0	0.396046615217	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.360717505983	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.310837973623	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.808372519498	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.428923300281	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
0.0	0.565582197525	Number one...
0.0	0.164156792508	And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.21884000357	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...
0.0	0.975599354093	$5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.222124453818	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.0204463560427	They were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.597818214063	In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, "what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"
1.0	0.52710113215	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.647938813028	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.0780724434621	You just want to...
0.0	0.652604387663	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.635011739655	Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.
0.0	0.865041967719	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.440035757853	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.0793954584714	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.438030247665	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
0.0	0.0617658223561	How stupid are our leaders?
0.0	0.280585218916	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.478229496565	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.264018192188	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.0806602460423	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.303812933656	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.0667138543489	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.0744850832804	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.
0.0	0.087363654151	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.225514642367	That's because we've put conservative policies in place.
0.0	0.0704281686736	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.971985996624	She voted for it.
0.0	0.0913747091035	I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.
1.0	0.089773606297	The 500,000 who came home with PTSD, and traumatic brain injury.
0.0	0.470453913697	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
1.0	0.954517302023	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.0949625871261	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.705196511466	The administration originally said 10.
0.0	0.19213661078	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.0709847072059	He is a good man.
0.0	0.0102693678763	Great.
0.0	0.92096772387	But -- but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages.
0.0	0.161841896525	I don't think a halt is necessary.
0.0	0.0911943138362	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.271648653992	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.284648842259	I mean, my dad went to college on a G.I.
0.0	0.268286361394	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
1.0	0.995753569273	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.476980913924	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.555286032005	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.0158182650118	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.452850357495	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.137800477713	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.201054146647	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
0.0	0.0526498925376	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.339070021869	As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.
0.0	0.290981569296	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.0996353210749	If I am elected president...
0.0	0.11411403277	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.25657730608	They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.
0.0	0.0122720688788	I like them.
0.0	0.289142944031	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.330022348384	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
1.0	0.872925282934	7 percent and 8 percent to go to college?
0.0	0.0805652634375	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.36669878295	Yes.
0.0	0.222532797561	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.673150008656	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
0.0	0.891594983849	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.509606873418	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.218774928157	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.281008020375	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.194935857104	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.369742168972	You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that.
0.0	0.125466904818	... but wait a minute...
0.0	0.858631810365	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.108385639519	They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America.
0.0	0.2154956237	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.0478726508538	You have a bigger problem with China.
0.0	0.136543832876	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.19670501958	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.386147231432	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
1.0	0.687616251448	I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer.
0.0	0.287333686323	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.0542954407041	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.561689195783	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.213550400899	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.673997906995	And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.
0.0	0.103280321201	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.125046529495	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.515954082676	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.269912382741	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.
0.0	0.0422240181867	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.302278224621	They are anxious on a number of levels.
0.0	0.391159522885	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.261821223875	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.
1.0	0.985906550251	Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.0912601959164	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.147127209677	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.
0.0	0.689690607748	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.314022644714	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.123848637494	That's not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.
0.0	0.404986168223	I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground.
0.0	0.168429190061	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.165191953811	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
1.0	0.827174626036	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.41022825443	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.228701815935	My son is not a pair of boots on the ground.
0.0	0.122787232107	So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.
0.0	0.0771849935753	... Chris, keep it coming...
0.0	0.731315172116	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.
0.0	0.129526176639	Let me say this.
0.0	0.015641626312	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.633121886095	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.172492376996	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.575551485973	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.268896439564	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.227752878711	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.
0.0	0.0876339505708	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.163521308064	I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
0.0	0.415787706065	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.0510055090944	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.463395643902	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.608079299393	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.5	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.0948067909299	If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
0.0	0.0323698162581	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.294572616451	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.508972128425	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.103776743611	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
0.0	0.0582824444741	I don't need the rhetoric.
0.0	0.188875742185	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.971817882886	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.371580678773	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
1.0	0.511324418181	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.968180067176	They make a billion dollars a day.
0.0	0.164378521377	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.0732846336475	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
1.0	0.958815499049	They were wrong.
0.0	0.986700034756	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.151986922816	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.34789069645	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.401418477025	That means medical.
0.0	0.201806257526	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.71898011756	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.0594305986294	You see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, I'm an optimist
0.0	0.407269978242	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.
0.0	0.0961850974358	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.187075180705	Starting with our children and moving forward.
0.0	0.196981152828	She did it for convenience.
0.0	0.0666238192679	May I respond?
0.0	0.305082554115	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.061487413953	Thank you Chris...
0.0	0.172247489823	But also, I can't fake anger.
1.0	0.670090966545	In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.
0.0	0.128530127503	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
0.0	0.033534155754	And that's what I will do as your president.
0.0	0.411145810246	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.23048275756	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.250919334497	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.00711837334038	...Chris...
0.0	0.5	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.64080977546	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.774473700596	The bill would involve legalization.
0.0	0.1928020965	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.257974661452	But wait, I just want to say this Senator.
0.0	0.844934608489	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.188351402962	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.348534139233	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.296323271537	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.16436683785	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.677281629886	They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe.
0.0	0.158957005271	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.700615683864	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.474809176442	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.131933059539	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.380328231603	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.0184644070696	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.340458132258	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.130321941786	That's the job.
0.0	0.0526498925376	Megyn, that's the problem.
0.0	0.26757547006	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.0607768517503	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.0312982806237	That's what should be done.
1.0	0.999999999455	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.0922761888535	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.196465838631	What should we do?
0.0	0.360287599211	We have three children, eight, five and one.
0.0	0.1484263359	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.132070089466	Yes, we must protect our borders.
0.0	0.14411909409	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
0.0	0.0667212750489	They have to be alert to problems.
0.0	0.313947968756	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.290918187805	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.599443066578	We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.
0.0	0.0622301201588	Media notwithstanding.
0.0	0.783522064931	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.180017608873	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.169849727958	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.
0.0	0.331979034167	We actually did it.
0.0	0.435205903907	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.79780425389	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.369200376094	But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
0.0	0.523965762708	It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act.
0.0	0.0206983178096	They don't like that.
0.0	0.00930350101658	Don't do it."
0.0	0.439699707048	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.248508395835	I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history.
0.0	0.0089360306667	But they're not good.
1.0	0.999997637425	They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.
0.0	0.227671858008	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.286070690368	By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa.
0.0	0.162015999269	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.397059236431	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.878525094165	So it's unfair to say in total...
0.0	0.584182256528	It had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.383025156272	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.196465838631	...
0.0	0.363867349717	Last point.
0.0	0.0279095533282	I'm proud of my family.
0.0	0.183455935738	And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.
0.0	0.138634285632	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.
0.0	0.371051066398	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.0618475057241	I have a problem with that, Martha.
0.0	0.0277289290561	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.227271692531	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.411807915544	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.0358207586208	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.121640701954	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.949512363377	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
1.0	0.990461770004	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.202718319864	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.232044718008	You know where their United States headquarters is located?
0.0	0.228817944513	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
1.0	0.999997562207	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
1.0	0.102032167465	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.792935319414	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.700006594755	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.573516558944	They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
0.0	0.250145993602	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.271227890526	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.135410504028	Our country has tremendous potential.
0.0	0.1502630284	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.244203586609	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.113440739341	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.0361498393427	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.0126931902711	And there's a lot.
0.0	0.151766712486	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.356650978105	RADDATZ: OK. Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, right here at Saint Anselm college, Neil Levesque.
0.0	0.159901187089	The no-fly zone, I would hope, would be also shared by Russia.
0.0	0.606257304109	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.314407393892	There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan.
0.0	0.610272725502	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.321430607892	And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.
0.0	0.150546890506	When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.
0.0	0.21467017002	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.194411456537	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.876021314883	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...
0.0	0.0814712824418	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.0666238192679	May I respond?
0.0	0.675193055885	That's 13,000 miles.
1.0	0.225449128852	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.298555938576	The United States has, unfortunately, been victimized by terrorism going back decades.
0.0	0.145685102512	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.375183160941	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.0714019212611	We need -- we need somebody -- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.
0.0	0.527549214973	I think that is the number one requirement.
0.0	0.0462839197245	And look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that.
0.0	0.287269211965	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.307393842577	We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it.
0.0	0.266912558062	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.190789322452	I would just say that...
0.0	0.0886440036691	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.262703897751	I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks.
0.0	0.195753919726	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
1.0	0.908752263338	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.215574386725	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.458770863661	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.144350633325	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.542640250266	I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
0.0	0.342250943657	If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
0.0	0.0944957384944	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.269357516134	And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.
0.0	0.853724938585	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.380070545627	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.139660440419	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.260300596587	Well, you've got to be on top of it right away.
0.0	0.757884880313	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.0511519497145	We have made some good progress.
0.0	0.0297309044945	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.250955079478	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.0826215100519	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.217398420019	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.28248723071	We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
1.0	0.786865151196	We passed it after 9/11.
0.0	0.165314719608	This is a terribly complicated issue.
0.0	0.0927328684533	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.261121327789	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.131465564991	Yeah.
0.0	0.0995293715935	Martha, thank you.
0.0	0.211138519768	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.966768201218	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.0440488375984	They're terrified by the saber rattling.
0.0	0.683052151832	I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment.
0.0	0.276438029819	You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.
0.0	0.0809557780759	I kind of miss Donald Trump.
0.0	0.0492312156792	): Secretary...
0.0	0.202575348035	But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said.
1.0	0.175587790065	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.457545133071	And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't.
0.0	0.213069339693	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.380577150545	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.3458568549	Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.
0.0	0.138261882729	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.
0.0	0.0563559167764	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.182475109622	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.254389501024	We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
0.0	0.908442795886	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
0.0	0.196452390549	I think this is a very difficult issue.
0.0	0.257910343014	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.0589471844225	I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
0.0	0.101949801986	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.0595518180104	They have no choice.
0.0	0.295530470964	As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election.
0.0	0.214290789185	And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.
0.0	0.96317788569	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.190367905902	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.
0.0	0.385945470153	But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it.
0.0	0.280816751702	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.844614908388	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.000485411802232	Look--
0.0	0.332168714967	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.136595654368	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.408924024165	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.15284154075	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.
0.0	0.21578403849	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.124609205863	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.289701949253	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.20039979434	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.148212691424	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
0.0	0.478875407256	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.0402432309124	I think he'd be a great spirit."
0.0	0.368265673938	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0618404563004	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.281401625623	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.
0.0	0.0955665931248	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.520944194172	And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring.
0.0	0.302106289592	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.412045293762	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.350415752568	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.0732803251481	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.331919470193	They;re gone.
0.0	0.034855208868	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.385836104897	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.223018782153	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.70124661675	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.0710262751199	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.347422426559	Drugs have taken far too many of our citizens.
0.0	0.730637769079	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.0262406504066	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.119354085231	I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.
0.0	0.186403337277	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.367301214802	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
1.0	0.89646765977	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.069289485257	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.492059509453	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.207700051152	The guns don't pull the trigger.
1.0	0.056711387508	They're rapists.
0.0	0.144687608696	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.241110951606	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.0665912878634	Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.515720778283	We have a corrupt campaign finance system dominated by Super PACs.
0.0	0.155163958087	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.170262602496	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.173237823309	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.371762718793	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.129974721197	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.20025314461	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.254695671393	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.176601459417	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.922924337146	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
1.0	0.975355136166	What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons.
0.0	0.750072309754	Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.
0.0	0.13657532966	They're killing us.
0.0	0.467645132375	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.134272955826	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.506278079705	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.0595900893346	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
0.0	0.248507964378	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.305296208468	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.274319049833	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.0924693677871	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.233939654211	Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.
0.0	0.185920179041	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.662283097604	I've employed -- I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
0.0	0.180343107556	You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future.
0.0	0.208928847891	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
1.0	0.999999737755	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
1.0	0.999999701316	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.095737739789	Find out what I said to Greenspan.
0.0	0.340357554192	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.0924693677871	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.431296553439	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.349231832137	Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength.

0.0	0.0289360515747	Excuse me.
0.0	0.249900584782	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.

0.0	0.0435895677613	We're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.46890832435	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.284783037505	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.483902099526	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.365041423244	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.286839370091	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.117576031152	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.0344054980836	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.146017306815	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.0577157075418	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.176363189362	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.0480788042604	I tell you that.
0.0	0.817018233857	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.0456529472074	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.232036928939	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.728340868026	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.0393258653373	Think about it.
0.0	0.119998002072	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.22964749009	So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.
0.0	0.12437112833	It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.
0.0	0.0399054324123	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.187908453493	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.156194042154	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.101076073966	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.381352524723	Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it.
0.0	0.443769167932	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.706438152914	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.277080925243	So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
0.0	0.4702180996	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.
0.0	0.114278921387	But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go.
0.0	0.36852340623	I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that's what Iowans like to do.
0.0	0.721399055155	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.
0.0	0.117581680311	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.132505505756	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.562449781721	I watched the video of Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.522326174945	A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this.
0.0	0.487981985346	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.662450539988	... we have the tools in federal law to do this now.
0.0	0.405987149603	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.435110848513	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.525983520015	We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that's what's keeping him contained.
0.0	0.270482884416	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.387947260237	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
1.0	0.390808856108	They stole it.
0.0	0.305959474129	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.54516819479	Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS.
0.0	0.219864889563	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.124014767056	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.16270728713	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.371633493094	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.111176882622	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.122092434584	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.403365090122	And those countries who are opposed to Islam, they are going to have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today.
0.0	0.0662750664947	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.425230134967	So, yes, this has developed.
1.0	0.999998645834	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.124158523905	As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.
0.0	0.194338617332	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.0950545555771	And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition, including Russia, to help us destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.162480443763	And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
0.0	0.136003324811	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.261170410034	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.15277483405	Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens.

0.0	0.0633146184256	...No, sir...
0.0	0.273421056157	I mean, let's talk about this arc of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about.
0.0	0.210827484531	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.629546320456	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.211738134063	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.117670376437	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.111056768442	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.

0.0	0.339022020777	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.205162371839	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.202459538994	That's true.

0.0	0.0850708798568	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.0950463696919	I'm really rich.
0.0	0.384487825189	You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?
0.0	0.302993312017	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.0752275387259	That's right.
0.0	0.0851043349478	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.17993264874	They come up to my office.
0.0	0.196465838631	...
0.0	0.950017773432	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.0631584687813	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.290016087392	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.89534754594	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.401748835481	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.21323095391	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.192301481215	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.177073221506	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.138034005263	It's not about Donald Trump.
0.0	0.0165473366326	That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
0.0	0.521506904614	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.37081607855	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.283600750791	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.148521257237	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.0466026045033	It's great to be back.
0.0	0.140021297329	We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.
0.0	0.0824887625898	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.417770894535	They're controlled fully -- they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
0.0	0.37687159915	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.135809662589	ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.
0.0	0.19750912159	It is going to be amazingly destructive.
0.0	0.251627979249	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.338327461808	But, of course, international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today.
0.0	0.217974307957	Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people.
0.0	0.00930350101658	I didn't.
0.0	0.291354407254	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.13021814973	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.288784929773	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.24342292931	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.178979891941	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.10855178921	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.
0.0	0.570336432163	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.269939517221	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.196465838631	But...
0.0	0.072875090928	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.318216085404	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.352838987091	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.831024721478	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.116866081555	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.0579804434521	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.322090605156	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.221408611023	You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
0.0	0.70814239211	We're spending $80 billion locking people up, disproportionately Latino and African American.
0.0	0.0978032353223	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.0367765065209	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.159471773699	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.0752275387259	That's right.
0.0	0.254570171748	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.024805506358	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.0367471242022	That's for sure.
0.0	0.545123414935	... funding to them.
0.0	0.447101298069	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.295377820704	We need to end minimal sentencing.
0.0	0.0687580106193	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.178559790528	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.273198486815	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.468045009218	I think it's fair to say that Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America, but the issue is...
0.0	0.369016560274	And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.
0.0	0.486944648071	Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place.
0.0	0.287449536641	But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."
0.0	0.113341791094	We need much more than that.
0.0	0.0295792548335	They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
0.0	0.245469716749	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.60273561172	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.484506111662	They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of Syria and Iraq.
1.0	0.202113331403	When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.112575729212	Now I want to go back something.
0.0	0.269054711458	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.438311300899	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.0643000209769	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.388984411607	The troops on the ground should not be American troops.
0.0	0.360420779053	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.114564184519	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.0128723322521	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.93645355681	And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion."
0.0	0.156313416984	We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.
0.0	0.0945804200136	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.232363198713	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.682220158365	... that's the -- that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration.
0.0	0.791601063648	Number one, there are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.0510699838294	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.0927943713959	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.173571347197	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
0.0	0.0448008069834	We know...
0.0	0.164015055546	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
1.0	0.9448156576	And I have assets -- big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected -- 9 billion 240 million dollars.
0.0	0.109107577341	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.880457507647	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.118502078202	They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.
0.0	0.199648436455	Like we have a -- we have a lot of work to do and we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do.
0.0	0.0790768238486	They don't know how to bring it about.
0.0	0.296667689475	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.00957739588347	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.629167400828	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.236183011105	And when he moved on his own people, threatening a massacre, genocide, the Europeans and the Arabs, our allies and partners, did ask for American help and we provided it.
0.0	0.349466637519	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.341616953163	We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress, but it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us.
0.0	0.0448008069834	And you know what?
0.0	0.075605508023	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.666260799037	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.210368730804	We are already de-conflicting air space.
0.0	0.820086042977	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.0738029850637	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.11586103869	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.206830742543	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.196465838631	You do.
0.0	0.136617363978	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.0354903245444	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.192173042093	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.0865567842603	Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name.
0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.
0.0	0.146396539129	Well, I just want to quickly add...
0.0	0.135195940283	We are doing both at the same time.
0.0	0.111819031277	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.170585318868	David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave.
0.0	0.107670425801	Let me just -- let me just...
0.0	0.0230640056372	I think there is a consensus.
0.0	0.199614556729	The list goes on because the differences are so stark.
0.0	0.838726440951	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.0354629501414	You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches.
0.0	0.215793072947	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
1.0	0.991700603118	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
0.0	0.103508096506	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.140695893364	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.0559833301819	Didn't just happen.
0.0	0.00711837334038	Chris...
0.0	0.490301060927	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.340528968925	And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump," and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns.
0.0	0.191385145433	You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.
0.0	0.0526498925376	No problem.
0.0	0.330214445835	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.126714886041	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
1.0	0.976985747648	And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.
0.0	0.260674746319	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.254614803724	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
1.0	0.99999837525	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.
0.0	0.437036431509	Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.
0.0	0.367108694536	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.0752275387259	That's not right.
0.0	0.232458384515	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.230047252338	The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.
0.0	0.608636915895	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.641424851449	And if our middle class makes more money, they spend more money, and our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.133673667988	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.557614093832	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.260236468226	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.690064955863	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.0607086614934	We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists.
0.0	0.161623574873	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...
0.0	0.0962994199546	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.0909958598391	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.816934507856	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.306605979614	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
0.0	0.293604758299	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.13897780565	Somebody said, "Oh, that's crass."
0.0	0.31746509312	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.163879982394	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.657581094718	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.184018623769	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.1208339409	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.746624248764	I sell apartments for -- I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.
0.0	0.263019365608	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.
0.0	0.383558335541	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.36669878295	Yes.
0.0	0.0710238752959	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.260230492713	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.
0.0	0.0215569783163	Marco, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.523119471724	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.0307380362018	And Martha...
0.0	0.192481991251	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.461351039711	Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.
0.0	0.225525746905	I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.
0.0	0.184020258049	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.361794568873	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.376212227894	Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.
0.0	0.0448008069834	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.246376090174	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.72720398013	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.0799089735852	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.164806961055	Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris.
0.0	0.36669878295	Yes.
0.0	0.234294973268	There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
1.0	0.41705284198	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.547717754418	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.288116053748	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.38196200219	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.

0.0	0.607539156016	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.364857516398	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.0500634739172	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.0653182926443	I mean, you know...

0.0	0.0779037911307	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.0624217808433	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.29691375844	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.121899711983	Let me conclude by just saying this.

0.0	0.032781267791	I don't want it.
0.0	0.349263387289	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.0428974229832	You're right.
0.0	0.196465838631	How?
0.0	0.389185329741	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.573150510675	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.0608062736348	Can I -- can I -- I just...
0.0	0.474263370649	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0540123696453	Came out great.
0.0	0.385005752709	It was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up.

0.0	0.610211135593	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.16195925162	And some, I assume, are good people.

0.0	0.0330003638613	OK...
0.0	0.207233793056	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.305498886777	After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the -- the donors and by the lobbyists -- and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero -- I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford.
0.0	0.134338320658	Martha, may I -- Martha, may I...
0.0	0.323524083218	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.119564513237	We've got to build a coalition abroad.
0.0	0.343974176837	And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe.
0.0	0.138932413668	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.791344121795	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.0594850408255	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.14828664615	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.605265986081	So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.
0.0	0.196465838631	No.
0.0	0.688241797591	Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage.

0.0	0.0986792753353	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.242549364911	And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.
0.0	0.316647635085	Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.
0.0	0.11897961905	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.141833068438	I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
0.0	0.233110783049	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
1.0	0.844152082776	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.108661252397	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.846940635971	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.190931640216	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.0967573253668	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
0.0	0.54094161455	We expand Medicare to all people.
0.0	0.0670873361231	Break them up.

0.0	0.0963246226665	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.582198676191	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.619666834299	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.175750585527	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.107940446803	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
0.0	0.0606314788735	You want to know why things don't get done in Washington?
0.0	0.0891517348599	That's the future of banking in America.
0.0	0.0746890460091	So I have voiced criticisms.

0.0	0.150406353262	A military island.
0.0	0.470947860694	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.131657278457	We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.
1.0	0.36447365034	Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees -- these are big vehicles -- were left behind for the enemy.
0.0	0.397378034684	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.15219430603	And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?
0.0	0.246937092713	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.175085992697	And, you know, I do think it's important to do exactly what Senator Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about, and that they talk to each of us about.
0.0	0.266518573051	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.00400254516256	Talk about what?
0.0	0.0559179111502	Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.
0.0	0.303998181845	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.512404684386	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.17555317535	Ted can change his mind.
0.0	0.414136349969	Now, this takes, David, 18 months to 24 months, two years.
0.0	0.472618120289	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.483061100604	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.383860168086	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.623407339837	It means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana.
0.0	0.176926484557	There will be a process.
0.0	0.0197210622625	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.320237163514	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.

0.0	0.0173299926651	Then I looked at Rubio.
0.0	0.152490621536	Come on now.
0.0	0.629734931844	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.127040445921	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.239983589953	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.280701244503	And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.
0.0	0.224823826618	She led that effort.
0.0	0.157196274173	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.396992696845	And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.196465838631	No.
0.0	0.604511518022	Total propaganda.

0.0	0.176320139595	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.571042918701	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.13042699481	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.444091251245	I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.323070113452	He's in favor of Common Core.

0.0	0.527535844202	I do not support amnesty...
0.0	0.346873965187	The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.

1.0	0.293768334819	They just built a hotel in Syria.
0.0	0.242856806474	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.303854793989	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.550359294725	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.10382356313	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.184914647485	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.201346147268	The answer is no.

0.0	0.129540092244	And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.
0.0	0.0604898598332	We need to figure this out together.
0.0	0.121106129961	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.250127950755	I guess the one I -- I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after Bin Laden.
0.0	0.540046601259	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.261103856457	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.233200708075	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.153075394566	There must be some way.
0.0	0.105849499242	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.236348036274	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.638682680806	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.280364963163	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.37649599858	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.196465838631	It was...
0.0	0.155952454724	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.608827733565	But accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000.

0.0	0.266033930085	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.140929604534	But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.0559290851022	Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done.
0.0	0.0141531622531	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.205164119037	If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country.
0.0	0.278660049161	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.120034104842	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.353323721323	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.091958123647	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.0721724543029	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.54022290259	She's the senator from New York.
0.0	0.851231284954	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.217449045524	They had a plan that was good.
0.0	0.265883975344	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.555686579766	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.099551043159	That's not the America that I think we should be.
0.0	0.559084969044	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.461011511412	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.824617732134	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.115751436843	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.0131515023283	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.355468525506	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
0.0	0.263754699941	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.5	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.340496910329	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.168245699825	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.29953274561	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.931187706791	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.131280459023	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.211008404534	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.131377293769	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.524516463563	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.219756247803	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.156881845348	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.364059371392	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.144955310047	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.0922989055779	But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here.
0.0	0.136173793336	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.393323590247	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.555611598992	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.450849399002	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.210826712354	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
1.0	0.999997120473	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
0.0	0.469419172288	But the United States is not the policeman of the world.
0.0	0.119417132842	We've been at this a couple of years.
0.0	0.338738489822	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.143917029365	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.117249957032	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.204237300351	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.122659028479	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
0.0	0.255837882948	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.196465838631	No.
0.0	0.0663090974737	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.0655954134969	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.361625668667	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.195183725784	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.0163935559138	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.570279253126	No hour is too short, no dollar too small.
0.0	0.109416557128	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.0574950926406	And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.
0.0	0.307859280601	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.25527860667	... do I go -- let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.561985209703	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.0508458671974	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.152449041283	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.294603691094	We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.
0.0	0.669586331068	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.
0.0	0.680769416696	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.023976128787	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.484089614215	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.181226169773	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.244106736735	Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that's not good enough.
0.0	0.163288801165	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.289695865789	We offered a lot more.
0.0	0.1964890951	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.283071290032	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
0.0	0.143084534489	That is our government today.
0.0	0.18448004458	People were shocked, Trump got it.
0.0	0.031422833854	Absolutely.
0.0	0.118785474035	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.12367350622	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.0638272836814	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.170658796472	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
0.0	0.355200422771	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.205318205131	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.458831853936	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.160006323308	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.
0.0	0.113781173115	Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."
1.0	0.839717274483	That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.
0.0	0.0522061244643	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.810529844969	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.302272067478	Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.0262915584729	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.368687170249	This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along.
0.0	0.261076625585	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.360615275581	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.0337852040254	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
1.0	0.817404195443	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.14626479988	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.608643231394	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.196465838631	...
0.0	0.118813127274	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.11158156638	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.414319508426	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.212063767746	The people don't work for us.
0.0	0.218934704902	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.127290332138	We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.
0.0	0.0957144524478	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.211968383192	Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country.
0.0	0.247342599025	And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
0.0	0.0484072789974	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.20858745243	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.105872799914	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.405982535064	I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
0.0	0.597686351906	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.044371790589	I don't have to brag.
0.0	0.0196368297163	The mentally ill?
0.0	0.233435190173	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.196465838631	But...
0.0	0.519048703782	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.143291028232	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.0845394242378	And they're wonderful people.
0.0	0.314138722271	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.0981171734628	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.344578735916	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.296634363264	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.307055851485	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.102389996236	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.0340783351075	OK, good.
0.0	0.101941923843	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.332370908287	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.19952966504	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
1.0	0.991364504792	I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians.
0.0	0.0583786882671	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.164478144893	... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region.
0.0	0.547852423831	You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.
0.0	0.088731388447	All of these are very difficult issues.
0.0	0.333808034619	In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...
0.0	0.38388814757	I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done.
0.0	0.473164574128	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
1.0	0.962255194339	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.466368892446	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.13687162275	You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.
0.0	0.149153914612	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.0725081561522	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.546444353054	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.263857811444	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.151509653111	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.126294324071	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.309512684924	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.0695964833734	If not, they can stay where they are.
0.0	0.144181999979	Many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed.
0.0	0.103254753976	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
0.0	0.25947546995	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.
0.0	0.223590624704	I would like to see it updated.
0.0	0.330699940036	I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.
0.0	0.196465838631	It was.
0.0	0.171291967459	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.581065859833	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.331618006983	Hey, I have lobbyists.
0.0	0.0865550853794	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.593404676175	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.119489641576	Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.
0.0	0.854469627247	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.191124594127	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.
0.0	0.115275513908	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.112018693868	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.236184302551	She is not qualified to be President of the United States.
0.0	0.0642480824413	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.295591672392	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.580385906272	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.0939352204458	They can't lead us.
0.0	0.0657067184779	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.618848054367	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.374094778677	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.021294388412	Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.
1.0	0.880075034543	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.403174225336	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.0521526373365	So it was not against ISIS, it was against -- it was against Assad.
0.0	0.150868655941	Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.
0.0	0.133479046746	You can change your mind.
0.0	0.031422833854	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.186300204635	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.361852835607	Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come...
0.0	0.83501683559	We have artificially low interest rates.
1.0	0.99999750936	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.14498481836	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.452532860342	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.0743164565392	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.221395127051	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.309778156624	It didn't have the votes to pass.
0.0	0.954289049106	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.162075345261	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.93601316588	... saying, no middle class tax raises.
0.0	0.0788187637168	Martha, if I may...
0.0	0.411371065788	And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow.
0.0	0.245231159146	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.204668902026	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.307234029413	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.218787670074	When do we beat Mexico at the border?
0.0	0.274094262902	That is a pledge that I'm making.

0.0	0.476190613674	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.

0.0	0.129673156021	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.0149164170256	So be very, very careful.
0.0	0.459809749681	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.5	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.358495258223	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.44750548434	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.643402439233	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.472791931895	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.124856569191	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.0473215422526	It's not working.
0.0	0.513151515607	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.281442487343	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.104575659331	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
0.0	0.465439933573	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.901926322004	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.192917189037	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.141075300327	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.0752275387259	That's right.
0.0	0.17570023809	We will see what the American people are willing to support.
0.0	0.350082074792	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.5	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.319777473446	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.269158627975	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.293027506926	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
1.0	0.887897287827	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.318998471104	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.286657820486	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.
0.0	0.120983141656	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.318611756826	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.224368599903	Chris I was mentioned in that question.
1.0	0.995638340939	And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.
0.0	0.154589619287	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
0.0	0.108421770073	So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
0.0	0.685388632892	I introduced...
0.0	0.775017441119	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.161944692269	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.214172610461	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.
0.0	0.304229591274	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.0603861750619	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.129526176639	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.124272445224	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.0862561868004	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.0663951420152	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.390556610749	Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability.
0.0	0.363584333149	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.255909685034	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.295085250794	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.399868996097	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.105309365723	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.
0.0	0.184046527051	And before I say it, I have to say this.
0.0	0.181101775327	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.46045508405	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.0537953665163	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.117689308649	Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home.
0.0	0.454920218927	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.209558923888	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
0.0	0.644847627598	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.199133528484	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.145652509063	This is absolutely absurd.
0.0	0.659031745289	... people all over this country -- not you, Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other.
0.0	0.18588675651	... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.663147184896	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.43636068744	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.383007335355	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.148818425506	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.0399416616047	I need your help.
1.0	0.98117489176	And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph).
0.0	0.351469729178	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
0.0	0.979218862944	So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion.
0.0	0.145003775953	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.204695610146	What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS.
0.0	0.122469343172	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.178127473177	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.25623207978	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.0617568741902	Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem.
0.0	0.0738783229142	It's hate action.
0.0	0.254681779002	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.147366097588	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.285043195922	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.645745894766	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.405043318964	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.208054192761	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.0873578199922	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.106519722959	These are very, very real issues.
0.0	0.305417564599	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.143019745212	(inaudible).
0.0	0.0581966623164	They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work.
0.0	0.311434659594	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.132890884582	And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it.
0.0	0.202594047278	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
0.0	0.249294803357	And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.
0.0	0.172664578385	I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party's nominee.
0.0	0.773366282739	In the last 30 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth.
0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.

0.0	0.0414719288235	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.335308331999	No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.
0.0	0.317496381029	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.569335426748	We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.
0.0	0.313947968756	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.351034515904	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.789465733642	There was a minimum wage at the state level, and some places went higher.
0.0	0.254165659275	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
0.0	0.137264635717	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.21804655426	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.00691475371499	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.87062419695	And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.
0.0	0.376283274188	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.386735537742	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.0303159043928	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.223727940343	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.232585782512	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.328303349629	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.215924603051	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.122469343172	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.329929373071	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.879987101961	Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day.
1.0	0.992116833471	When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.
0.0	0.105364841097	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.0283216132611	Chris, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.331560431889	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.379250595108	And I think that's the false choice...
0.0	0.0652197577573	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.123351275575	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.220581381162	If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.
0.0	0.247104707322	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.491163312922	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.0849894695291	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.

0.0	0.238240295235	I don't get any money from Wall Street.
0.0	0.277216588823	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.467452525657	And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.
0.0	0.36219334999	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.0392071106527	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.191936790781	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.

0.0	0.15241079836	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.579960031774	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.

0.0	0.234194863615	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.331304654215	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.207966727041	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.
0.0	0.103534136253	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.449322921719	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.968136793989	It costs me $3.
0.0	0.209219240694	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.
1.0	0.999999999995	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.381830324328	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.233017743324	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.395585351508	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.424582666592	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.0446278753447	That is why we need to make...
0.0	0.780123944099	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.176139336107	As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans.
0.0	0.306645332612	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.196465838631	And why?
0.0	0.241454365919	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.378920573747	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.0525771608492	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.287767069376	I never said that.
0.0	0.134609962663	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.100448794744	Let's keep going.
0.0	0.465727323706	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.109616901722	We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.
0.0	0.0197958020498	Whoa.
0.0	0.169155923791	In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance.
0.0	0.198156050462	I think it's a two-pronged issue.
0.0	0.167319921749	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.0416365859356	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.0493504810157	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.052160301035	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.097028643546	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.467132878313	You know, on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign, I was in Keene, and I was asked what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?
0.0	0.47682272792	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.444724690127	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.155274645519	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.563855502484	And it will have effects in the private market.
1.0	0.992101905243	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.148785206058	You have to lead.
0.0	0.5	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.197749533203	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.266342450078	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.692566109482	I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.
0.0	0.653273222656	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.388037384291	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.470630492238	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.287767069376	I never said that.
0.0	0.162833075505	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.0632104950305	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.460230868359	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.30375620144	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.662210934255	But Secretary Clinton is wrong.
0.0	0.561372929879	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.00930350101658	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.481350718278	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.00930350101658	No, you weren't.
0.0	0.424121139071	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
0.0	0.251747630038	The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
0.0	0.0769990818579	We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.
0.0	0.141199300491	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.337383704892	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.164738283077	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.115887144797	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.417233756998	If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.
0.0	0.816778375304	And I used it to pay off my loans.
1.0	0.997045052122	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.0794090422729	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.0960298455425	And it's an honor to have everybody here.
0.0	0.35091550634	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.261607509377	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.0721117241971	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
1.0	0.890563124554	And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
0.0	0.424956276822	We got a U.N. Security council vote.
0.0	0.106025596553	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
0.0	0.321005767029	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.181785690328	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.09771958924	And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a -- that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.
0.0	0.210522105927	I promise.
0.0	0.446441701415	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.359425625981	In the 1980s, it was in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Reagan's administration, and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel, and others were murdered.
0.0	0.031422833854	Absolutely.
0.0	0.397316801353	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.0389805892637	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.120786757804	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.134433947437	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
0.0	0.97813535544	It is not because of the tax writeoff.
0.0	0.216861477172	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.30512893719	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.0262975820714	They don't have a clue.
0.0	0.231888591525	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.383885851445	And, yes, we are at war with those people.
0.0	0.11364921322	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.105828084735	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.0359253226921	Okay.
0.0	0.976744143113	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.471681473871	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.365405659748	We brought together legislation supported by the American Legion, the VFW, the DOD, Vietnam Vets, all of the veterans organizations, which was comprehensive.
0.0	0.290506467685	On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center.
0.0	0.127530649576	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.665395879634	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.310429437647	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.260879473737	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.5	And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.
0.0	0.512932243708	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.150541771091	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.187023530842	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.121106129961	Bottom line.
1.0	0.989226790994	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
1.0	0.596984439739	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.780277612645	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.27953839738	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.
0.0	0.654671767827	When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish Glass-Stegall.
0.0	0.359528505132	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.407038829584	The United States must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.0655720874206	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.058128355338	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.686580217204	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.196470133931	That is important.
0.0	0.301243596691	How can you get people to vote for you?"
0.0	0.299417637696	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.0683201757824	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.21668968435	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.0524398635262	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.423453073394	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.283660395923	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.36414753915	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.104265461624	I didn't know I had so much power.
0.0	0.03523280209	I like how you stand up.
0.0	0.0614753366452	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.111488801404	Let me respond...
0.0	0.107993848889	I would not want to go to that point.
0.0	0.212610655591	They've become rich.
0.0	0.10764807463	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
0.0	0.204566750163	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.33279220777	Well, this whole issue concerns me.
0.0	0.086012194143	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.128545815245	Now they're going militarily.
0.0	0.45528997586	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.599772909619	We haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.
0.0	0.361370464268	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.19254390461	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.0404689192839	Look, I served on...
0.0	0.411178178642	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.308088025353	And I understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary.
0.0	0.372879162912	Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values.
0.0	0.266542828414	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.193959800541	But people have to be alert.
0.0	0.0990034505397	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.144916913986	Well, let's take it one at a time.
0.0	0.257884909586	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.00870755880189	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.0577794401236	That's the big leagues.
0.0	0.222658893548	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.018828377109	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.148665551968	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.661779271481	States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government.
0.0	0.112989290696	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.0698266100623	We've got nothing.
0.0	0.265572050806	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.0675427484218	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.0705175835224	They do it to us, we don't it.
1.0	0.00236696978542	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.270019268799	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.0733057810673	Well, there are so many, I don't know where to start.
0.0	0.923902040383	And remember the $5 billion Web site?
0.0	0.3387086987	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.832317641364	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.100575234017	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.435062464994	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.
0.0	0.5	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.944914077394	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.30809765498	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.
0.0	0.101884938535	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.00927722339405	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
1.0	0.604032713644	Today, we have 272.
0.0	0.0499146267879	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.203525438356	So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.
0.0	0.0593840911226	You know, the situation is this.
0.0	0.0728039233258	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.133841883698	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.455728540788	I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
0.0	0.219864889563	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.209184678631	Bigger than that?
0.0	0.0503556269562	No, I don't think so.
0.0	0.440710728481	If they want to accept our values and our laws.
0.0	0.140278593952	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.276290079513	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.0836988395073	They elected moderate leaders.
1.0	0.990459213337	In 1988, just to set the record straight governor, I ran for the U.S. House.
0.0	0.315875988802	You bet they do.
0.0	0.463089926134	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.202324476528	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.127969807398	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.653427914948	People died, and only three people have been fired.
0.0	0.354202852422	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.0578823447765	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.3421209359	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.0554626517758	He didn't know.
0.0	0.0157768456258	I think you're --
0.0	0.0443672279619	That's kind of a no-brainer.
0.0	0.821676636905	Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions?
0.0	0.323226618934	We didn't win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America.
0.0	0.163027711911	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.0329749873637	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.355448943729	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.092346358019	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.543029260469	I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.0269841985564	Not everybody remembers that.

0.0	0.199029981789	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.0627983660724	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.024859980448	I have a wonderful family.
0.0	0.466678247622	And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.
0.0	0.0656716373543	He's not arming the Kurds.
0.0	0.180055056427	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.0762326762195	And we do have a role in this.
0.0	0.37977182181	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.00496889114188	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.452829638085	And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.
0.0	0.313330898652	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.69440759213	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.209611665888	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.654047189092	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.218835717056	We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America.
1.0	0.580421010034	However, what Alan Krueger said in the piece you're referring to is that if we went to $15, there are no international comparisons.
0.0	0.188320958985	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.222774842478	That's fine.
0.0	0.185778098017	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.0617805773331	The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering, these are not the perpetrators.
0.0	0.149051657541	I would change them.
0.0	0.383643122961	We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt.
0.0	0.0703361144872	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.0966847807566	He'll say.
0.0	0.408362314225	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.304595617494	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.0646293246489	But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.314894647173	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.193912547739	Maybe now we can get it moving again so that we can upgrade it so that it does include all the tools and everything in our arsenal that we can use to try to work with our allies and our friends, come up with better intelligence.
0.0	0.263442144989	But I agree, as I mentioned a moment ago, with King Abdullah.
0.0	0.0916858945046	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.171306708028	What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger.
0.0	0.416904058175	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.

0.0	0.175705787203	Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.
1.0	0.792196033083	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.221941452176	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.203292829498	And I think this is an important question.
0.0	0.0601344187396	There's give and take.
0.0	0.251134923452	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.256627656251	I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not.
1.0	0.950935472401	Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.
0.0	0.0122720688788	I like that.
0.0	0.227074402612	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.056432200367	So was I, John.
0.0	0.201168737337	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.0954648265913	By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job.
0.0	0.251177032122	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.651365704442	But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America.
0.0	0.96784672441	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.131177081689	None of that information was looked at.
0.0	0.660808011138	Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.
0.0	0.269592107008	When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it.
0.0	0.032459494217	I really am.
0.0	0.21332955309	And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.
0.0	0.11914240652	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.0487624631028	In this building, in Trump Tower.
0.0	0.963685373281	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.149691548611	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
1.0	0.965016322854	She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.
0.0	0.182558433478	He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing?
0.0	0.159279698385	I'll advertise my Web site as well.
0.0	0.655879337596	We need, basically, to pledge that we're going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.
0.0	0.566702404535	We're up 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.132442410861	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.2912259915	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.0783581033104	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.188339056392	We were attacked from Afghanistan.
0.0	0.21992720572	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.0948344904162	And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.
0.0	0.623046099911	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.333521152097	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.0359206672036	I'm an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I miss doing eye surgery, still get to do a little bit.
0.0	0.183442265893	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.363683952868	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.0509221709531	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.3367520482	I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country.
0.0	0.419056182553	Meanwhile, the rich get richer.
0.0	0.135195940283	All the time.
0.0	0.261218272668	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.126637511236	I'm all about making sure we actually get results for whatever we do.
0.0	0.633668136273	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.39550624035	They've advertised that.
0.0	0.267605292947	Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.
0.0	0.146540603445	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.0407288770342	Are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not?
0.0	0.137613843585	If he'd like to play, that's fine.
0.0	0.0591160255004	As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe.
0.0	0.168412546324	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.
1.0	0.77530157156	Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.
0.0	0.138855917003	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
1.0	0.58293668307	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.540394432853	First of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy, as you've indicated.
1.0	0.351770373141	We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.

0.0	0.100313704648	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.19399562844	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.

0.0	0.80707043308	We were the first to pass a minimum wage.
0.0	0.19312993926	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.210335972301	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.193682466679	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.221337088208	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.141455635272	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.799556068264	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.143142661933	And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.
0.0	0.057292102459	So should the UK, so should France.
0.0	0.263663810432	That was before he was running against me.

0.0	0.385965875852	Everybody's for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.
1.0	0.990223087009	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.0248892427202	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.0354777476508	And it has been amazing to me.
0.0	0.93711610756	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.56934038292	Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.
0.0	0.891086910335	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.124493101378	Think back to Garland, Texas.

0.0	0.0834740577393	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.0353501532312	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.108958444302	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.650703621478	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.464355089564	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.0920501999194	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.

0.0	0.103847574754	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.147933829639	That's a hard road to walk.

0.0	0.0338469650199	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.0269566658546	Alright.
0.0	0.288135120121	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.0896102671253	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.428272651279	I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor, I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very, very powerful and most important of all jobs in the United States, the president, whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country.
0.0	0.58793546862	And that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity -- kill people who are unarmed who should not be killed, they must be held accountable.
0.0	0.065664251343	It's what they call it.
0.0	0.0598154263183	They're not sending you.

0.0	0.409886848005	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.615646862314	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.137975626084	So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly.
0.0	0.155922439557	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.349722277452	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.680454146079	But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance.
0.0	0.999987098185	...income tax...

0.0	0.302678565217	Yes, exactly, exactly.
0.0	0.184894554114	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.209806583717	We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.
0.0	0.169706628242	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.049392801289	You just can't do it.
1.0	0.452762021686	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.598935132634	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.301018504969	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.179848645634	And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.
0.0	0.204711067302	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.255069740154	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.527616757865	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.267071438759	Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint.
0.0	0.5	Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country.
0.0	0.114362833582	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.22526741235	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.321892329438	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
1.0	0.732687230068	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.

0.0	0.228998324934	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.

0.0	0.143019745212	(inaudible).
0.0	0.351676833476	ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.
0.0	0.319041967691	I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out.
0.0	0.072688761178	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.0322662358231	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.879115745103	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
1.0	0.916358646039	It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.
0.0	0.32320652096	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.271070193665	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.565993881101	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.739925518336	I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains.
0.0	0.130426103563	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.
0.0	0.0823928129214	And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem.
0.0	0.0926625236781	And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China.
0.0	0.460661251693	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.
0.0	0.0675266547705	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.315526785285	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.0915651705862	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?

0.0	0.0752275387259	That's not right.
0.0	0.342602334331	What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the Muslim nations in that region who are going to have to fight and defend their way of life.
0.0	0.123892959559	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.

0.0	0.253156556727	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.197291280292	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.196098691452	So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.
0.0	0.123312450269	So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.
0.0	0.0593243751909	I don't think we're at war with Islam.

0.0	0.243730385348	I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.

0.0	0.908624617579	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.

0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.
0.0	0.0805017449431	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.19071362117	And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work.
0.0	0.710140375352	And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.
0.0	0.246687571315	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.

0.0	0.012277475926	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.0361365899004	I can do that.
0.0	0.58790282557	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.34240175046	In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill, "Well I assume Hillary has told you about this."
0.0	0.196984928489	We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...
0.0	0.57100770397	Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military.

0.0	0.249569497916	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.250604209735	I don't need anybody's money.

0.0	0.031422833854	Absolutely.
0.0	0.273220427547	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.45871619859	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.628475434776	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.178040500979	Now, it's very interesting.
0.0	0.236013534265	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.259035368521	Nobela (ph) is a rising entrepreneur.

0.0	0.387760236705	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.

0.0	0.169357494527	Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.017544675219	And I'm confident we can do that.
0.0	0.674722541385	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.110693798014	But they can't get along.

0.0	0.102123933535	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.141400781881	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.917587368633	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.71349259705	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.031422833854	Absolutely.

0.0	0.141898463942	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.196465838631	Have to do it.
0.0	0.0448008069834	We know about the Belgians.
0.0	0.309865683934	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.0384936999004	He's an entertaining guy.
0.0	0.394291614138	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.339797117937	And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.
0.0	0.691607851739	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.442216893501	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.0662619758225	I think so, right.
0.0	0.722594419833	And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.
0.0	0.11471487853	It's affordable for everybody.
0.0	0.642028608697	But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired.
0.0	0.18884410262	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.191286803114	I am telling the truth.
0.0	0.166799813439	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.113498877679	But I would say this to you, Bret.
0.0	0.164171263283	This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.
0.0	0.11331781156	If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.

0.0	0.356710665942	I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.
0.0	0.086065690616	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.176680467032	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.358024567252	But, bottom line is this is the year 2015.
0.0	0.288230657317	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.434686688898	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.0179644869744	That's the difference.
0.0	0.391906523015	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.132140478278	In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
0.0	0.645382534838	Your question was you have disagreed...
0.0	0.251635567025	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.0448008069834	And you know what?
0.0	0.308881728732	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
0.0	0.00610321390616	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.228302448363	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.5	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.29318681613	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.259424679488	And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said.
0.0	0.342254412831	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.207860414448	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.0330003638613	OK.
0.0	0.543792159899	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.0716099650398	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.00545105846602	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.235349361327	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.155738355239	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
0.0	0.277272178437	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
0.0	0.220796635017	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.758230706816	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.479185923751	Again, with all do respect to Secretary Clinton...
0.0	0.196465838631	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.30386210233	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.545593409739	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.210019113707	And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that.
0.0	0.387967730709	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.336928008181	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.254089063245	All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee.
0.0	0.040478544775	That's my view.
0.0	0.351725426919	Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting...
0.0	0.548352086632	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.476585330573	As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.
0.0	0.0521526373365	It is ISIS.
0.0	0.251452823267	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
0.0	0.169101558219	Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...
0.0	0.124416032056	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.104544107731	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.123456455541	So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.
0.0	0.51834830365	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.393849957118	ISIS, now, is the major priority.
0.0	0.160823354071	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.12082909826	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.0752275387259	All right.
0.0	0.719512804947	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.523119471724	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.0036711012694	So did you, Marco.
0.0	0.190965918696	And we have to stop all the divisions.
0.0	0.190429149931	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.137824738019	I'm meeting with three of them in the next week.
0.0	0.384610640688	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.522739172575	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.197194739013	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.0402144567383	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.196465838631	But what...
0.0	0.162133924234	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
1.0	0.973580902515	This small country has welcomed in many refugees.
0.0	0.211518137258	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.0507964107757	We saw a dictator overthrown.
0.0	0.701650560434	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.309449264614	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.318797731456	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.885448229783	That is why I support a $12 national federal minimum wage.
0.0	0.171291967459	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.124431171206	They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there.
0.0	0.0861661444965	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.0726969674049	He said, "I can't get it into China.
0.0	0.25224075007	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.0578706778948	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.00337930183116	It is a disaster.
0.0	0.30104426781	And Abdullah said something recently, very important.
0.0	0.185311237505	Please become part of the political revolution.
0.0	0.258031680327	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.10371947087	Nobody can do that like me.
0.0	0.358358727844	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.231920312391	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.53706567403	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.358028332076	At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida.
0.0	0.401098667375	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.680839647202	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.338573274267	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.331064512304	... First of all -- Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.265896809389	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.
0.0	0.383376266923	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.207582052635	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.568541378094	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.595580034765	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.0719524070162	... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
0.0	0.121878520445	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.184088453799	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.136384955581	I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.
0.0	0.597532703798	It's campaign -- a corrupt campaign finance system.
0.0	0.141223033151	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.330345048329	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.461919126794	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.380253735833	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.287567578927	That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.
0.0	0.337367493292	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.0812596594889	I think that's a major accomplishment.
1.0	0.610435324462	And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
0.0	0.172414891744	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.447344983502	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.181663279166	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.0827908886052	I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.
0.0	0.84613317622	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.322226076583	I was there and I saw the debate.
1.0	0.607639506671	John -- John, this country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.532994636088	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.461880328337	We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.
0.0	0.21949962555	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.547968722049	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.152596058151	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.403753338883	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.0833899122189	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.317198046934	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.
0.0	0.459709359444	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.75481159842	So protect the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.260086127772	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.722534498369	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.0474573264546	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.127877140968	We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
0.0	0.171182172451	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.686850110936	It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English.
0.0	0.203308484155	But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.264060671802	Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.841385175965	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
0.0	0.278615098041	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.0592126109843	You're simply not.
0.0	0.293099543883	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.0331050423938	And I watch the speeches.
0.0	0.0982366823562	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.312342005442	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.
0.0	0.176820786395	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.205296620026	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.114596461727	It never happens.
0.0	0.151127852744	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.0582356456501	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.277861691454	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.674051190315	But at the end of the day, what you have right now are millions of Americans working two or three jobs because their wages that they are earning are just too low.
0.0	0.120780845513	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.18982427664	You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well.
0.0	0.0571537612049	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.0419408008113	And here's what's going to happen.
0.0	0.66712505315	It wasn't the bill that I wanted, but yet it turned out to be one of the more significant pieces of veterans' legislation passed in recent history.
0.0	0.298362052048	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.407838656735	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.214621918836	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.258944891775	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.0560463835529	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.534897478754	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.155220690115	And I do not believe it's a good idea now.
0.0	0.0653558902353	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.147543239121	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.277585909036	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.113841680884	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.327889236385	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
0.0	0.24978187059	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
1.0	0.169399386643	I think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street...
0.0	0.274084270667	All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.
0.0	0.139147806555	So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.
0.0	0.311742917454	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.0916404284367	You count on it.
0.0	0.394748266787	Their business model is greed and fraud.
0.0	0.0973281202225	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.282020646254	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.370387224373	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
1.0	0.850012624089	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.177051406297	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.352548597011	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.196465838631	How about this?
0.0	0.435848134224	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.0600551574569	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.183690846382	So the reporter said to me the other day, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person.
0.0	0.0975436662157	Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense.
0.0	0.042812258018	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.241358666451	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.360179977425	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.
0.0	0.159203856411	There are many crises that come -- a water crisis in Toledo.
0.0	0.0752275387259	Right.
0.0	0.136558944593	They are not our friend, believe me.
0.0	0.293498173718	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.491332639166	But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector.
0.0	0.0468007966612	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.092181366434	Am I supposed to dislike them?
0.0	0.0941385180392	They're saying, "Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough."
0.0	0.386491483484	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.0727802436604	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.200697204232	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.241774254636	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.0892493142716	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?
0.0	0.101697844707	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.152400405057	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.190328644065	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.209224958044	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.198855230685	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.433313989099	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.319123372909	Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them.
0.0	0.0569795753562	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.0906466683089	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.36669878295	Yes.
0.0	0.5	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.00337930183116	It's a disaster.
0.0	0.119480715224	I said, "I don't know."
0.0	0.394324057656	They want American troops back in the Middle East.
0.0	0.0945779746815	I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.
0.0	0.36271847566	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.
0.0	0.112065814799	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.196465838631	No -- no...
0.0	0.447863944416	And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.
0.0	0.0920440620483	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.518279654471	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.419124204362	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.131465564991	Yeah.
0.0	0.338932502936	Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors.
0.0	0.15449013929	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.921650942288	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.219066968406	The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.
1.0	0.792381119021	Nancy, the blueprint in Maryland that we followed was yes, we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment.

0.0	0.144674375039	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.189179302469	Quite likely, for that reason.
0.0	0.156005138857	But it's a lot safer.
0.0	0.279312119952	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
0.0	0.184894554114	They were wrong.
0.0	0.354924212217	And for my part, I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has.
0.0	0.298986619395	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.

0.0	0.0239003014165	And that's what's happening.
1.0	0.996894538367	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.0330003638613	OK.

0.0	0.488816555576	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.207664768227	It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee.
0.0	0.300056482456	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.
0.0	0.0488794274455	I hope Congress says no to this deal.

0.0	0.196465838631	Both.
0.0	0.240973543448	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.

0.0	0.409852667473	Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
0.0	0.259428703605	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.132632833734	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.0709558434562	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.00713689197364	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.451037902057	But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.

0.0	0.514940533579	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
0.0	0.0646914903297	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.22448956357	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.

0.0	0.414244369025	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.194731341364	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.0520769534404	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.
0.0	0.293040424909	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.519743639486	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.948360686627	I want the Buffett Rule to be in effect, where millionaires have to pay 30 percent tax rates instead of 10 percent to nothing in some cases.
0.0	0.225591327215	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.20386430013	And the reason -- and the reason...

0.0	0.0643000209769	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.165043389862	I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie.
0.0	0.712794663284	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.415088023232	And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.
1.0	0.982019527276	Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?
0.0	0.751921259548	Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.
0.0	0.598749148748	Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product -- a sign of strength, right?
0.0	0.750426296537	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.296243078671	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.112430094321	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.602552339309	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.650517451846	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.303688851858	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.244779523806	So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe.
0.0	0.100980457643	He said, "You know, I make great product."
0.0	0.15443881174	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.331206523927	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.316271812081	Border security has always been a part of that debate.
0.0	0.05101719897	We hear a lot of good plans.
1.0	0.96825721248	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.0680661316207	That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.
0.0	0.693471377738	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.146016254	I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria.
0.0	0.474638861311	It's one of the key investments we need to make.
0.0	0.572739207233	And I have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run.
0.0	0.184894554114	He's wrong.
0.0	0.539353194272	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.196349672542	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.242216015656	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.357629631117	And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq.
0.0	0.0993628285205	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.704143047132	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.118046744505	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.297780651468	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.121519754648	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.308885414014	I am advocating...
0.0	0.570483038037	And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.
0.0	0.5	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.511265260541	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."

0.0	0.191602514645	... family leave for a very long time...
0.0	0.212696833891	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.178050852075	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.618731511547	If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out.
0.0	0.523576734009	That means education.
0.0	0.197027162037	I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.
0.0	0.842866602375	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.221231937396	I've had had two town halls, one in Keene, one in Laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do.
0.0	0.643133866741	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.0690200951481	And guess what?
0.0	0.228971830398	I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.
0.0	0.938856419316	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.574666967709	But unlike either of these two fine people, I've actually balanced a budget every single year.
0.0	0.157443055478	I think we all support it.
0.0	0.154389928974	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.980209034157	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.0671527781899	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.237360306451	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.354265772929	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.411329543239	And, I would not that there's a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that's the EPA's blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline.
0.0	0.630086551154	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
0.0	0.314276586055	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.433573951022	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.175661881117	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.026990580559	I hate to hear it."

0.0	0.161931313517	I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.
0.0	0.199311768199	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
1.0	0.999999986621	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.331017910917	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.221813779827	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.942117235668	We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.
0.0	0.784046563208	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.0367471242022	Sure did.
0.0	0.196465838631	No.
0.0	0.421173037984	Major crisis and primary health care.
0.0	0.0537193350945	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.0549544899291	Might I respond?
0.0	0.315085468107	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.
0.0	0.236758026928	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.335364065411	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.542914215523	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
0.0	0.0465297181609	No, I think they won't.
0.0	0.322845733923	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.300100916853	So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.
0.0	0.313673277901	And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college.
0.0	0.0366508059339	We don't know anything about that.
1.0	0.891594983849	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.312731604924	We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.
0.0	0.176516500352	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.393602238786	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.24933860422	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.0553677493378	But look, we didn't know what was happening next.
0.0	0.223661088752	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.16408277534	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.231651657328	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
1.0	0.259905526641	They're bringing drugs.
0.0	0.125876213702	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.787943069095	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.195730607502	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.107322097022	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.251959174948	Check it out.
1.0	0.958815499049	That's wrong.
0.0	0.0888754680193	So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do.
0.0	0.179688440632	What our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as Americans.
0.0	0.0390207440324	But it will be...
0.0	0.345693821674	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.0826652087395	This is the election...
0.0	0.773715633488	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.310229913538	I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.
0.0	0.209948641669	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.934273612939	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.397583743002	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.419174306824	I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.
0.0	0.0622779640742	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.0908270675226	The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.
0.0	0.131465564991	Yeah.
0.0	0.162562383524	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
1.0	0.334524306306	And some of them are like third world countries.
0.0	0.0601322455983	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.196283508332	I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.
0.0	0.309271747033	The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...
0.0	0.13331974131	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.594604256015	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.317269915249	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.12954604851	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.0544656771392	So Hillary and I have a difference.
0.0	0.213071605604	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.0753374939332	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.0721004661529	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.210699913741	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.553179024905	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.198960870196	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.374019745545	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.056432200367	...John...
0.0	0.901926322004	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.535749596515	We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital.
0.0	0.180506958519	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.509830797106	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.355531524323	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.296548097571	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.108430843653	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.

0.0	0.323407587652	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.29709933393	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.506276524363	And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty.
0.0	0.349332862449	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.467983145972	It all will be scrutinized.
0.0	0.55347996627	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.323420967074	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.383214607566	People came back from Iraq and Afghanistan without legs, without arms.
0.0	0.0752275387259	That's right.
0.0	0.0781707634641	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.155767179102	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.127854287768	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.228673027693	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
1.0	0.999994321574	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.437238844817	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.195612369211	We bailed out Wall Street.
0.0	0.348434816862	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.0909773284974	And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are.
0.0	0.160206278322	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.303433894956	Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
0.0	0.171291967459	Thank you very, very much.
0.0	0.47228631726	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
0.0	0.196465838631	...
0.0	0.359967462918	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.172492376996	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.219614365689	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.193955648381	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.22309970523	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.177895284312	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.116199719371	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.215839458708	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.185732170441	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.3470085604	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.897978129555	Those hedge funds.
0.0	0.323494095554	And it requires an entire world to come together, including in a very active way, the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.102889569393	... and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.165953287328	You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.
0.0	0.09961086145	I am the son and grandson of immigrants.
0.0	0.0813179300177	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.120856858561	I think I am a nice person.
0.0	0.132399373229	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.0602770636671	You don't hear it from anybody else.
0.0	0.411478292894	And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina, and many other Republican states, that because of their right wing political ideology, are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.167408959249	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.116720257345	I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third.

0.0	0.208624647222	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.208611226302	Well, David, I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country.
0.0	0.305080909977	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.902822723337	We end up paying the highest prices in the world.
0.0	0.336816339056	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.153570076865	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.311218623708	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.125887124242	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.0969678044464	It's called the politics.
0.0	0.41649340739	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.756709516836	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.019907429527	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.210616311646	And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition.
0.0	0.376890602535	I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader.
0.0	0.316365164433	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.327520765232	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.252389285477	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.550965578886	I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.
0.0	0.265807850001	And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent.
0.0	0.844152082776	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.277192897032	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.451962355386	Of course the United States must lead.
0.0	0.171313390095	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.141036185334	Martha -- I would just repeat that --
0.0	0.269969952472	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.252664289652	So, in terms of refugees, I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe, with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that, of course, we reach out.
0.0	0.056338883525	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.842136488243	By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started.
0.0	0.322330348007	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
0.0	0.118410820667	I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.
0.0	0.168438132759	And that's what we have= representing us.
0.0	0.0399416616047	I need your help.
0.0	0.333715848183	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.10021706974	You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.
0.0	0.680867496551	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.0191466689174	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.62023588444	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.00981270967799	Look what they did in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.00518656144599	We are rebuilding China.
0.0	0.352667934127	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.056432200367	No, John.
0.0	0.205186608929	We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America.
0.0	0.0948430379465	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.279458898228	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.182272886756	That means everything.
0.0	0.509740184235	Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.
0.0	0.615460156371	But bottom line now, is in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or her family.
0.0	0.0433339269166	Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.
0.0	0.5	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.161269397554	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.196465838631	...
0.0	0.956302040607	You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent.
0.0	0.381261402981	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.139492300063	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.0951743294778	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.880411054435	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.922739123567	We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally.
0.0	0.350254986252	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.132615647021	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.237006712891	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.0762496396012	We don't win.
0.0	0.380136512564	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
1.0	0.0371049006743	It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.319351708262	I've prosecuted terrorists.
0.0	0.329929373071	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.422981925566	So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.
0.0	0.395736149841	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.184988059546	I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States and literally around the world that there is a "clash of civilizations," that there is some kind of Western plot or even "war against Islam," which then I believe fans the flames of radicalization.
0.0	0.296564217355	Ford.
0.0	0.190590517284	Doctors are quitting.
0.0	0.252499981544	You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911.
0.0	0.135944658133	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.527219499699	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.345345666438	So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.
0.0	0.29975085331	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.625297647985	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.0730447387387	I totally get that.
0.0	0.632270331957	But here, a total net worth of -- net worth, not assets, not -- a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets -- Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York -- many other places all over the world.
0.0	0.39696615308	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.627445214972	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.121971249104	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
1.0	0.661201205193	I never filed for bankruptcy.

0.0	0.109323640644	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.0687430861809	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.263337046684	And she turned around many lives.
0.0	0.345978374863	My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.
0.0	0.0135014702225	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.3363606579	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.47806416087	The first vote hasn't been counted.
0.0	0.5	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.0877575126369	There are hundreds of things like that.
0.0	0.294605442987	So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income.
0.0	0.5	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.540685258535	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.643288444701	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.506288770076	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.0307646828146	We have nothing.
0.0	0.221646103895	But if you place good ones, you pocket it.
0.0	0.668173300385	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.258506192008	I've laid out...

0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.
0.0	0.0776313781224	We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression.
0.0	0.581699704306	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
1.0	0.982012767303	One candidate said, you know what, I don't think it's a great idea that we sell automatic weapons in this country that are used by the military to kill people very rapidly.
0.0	0.173829692236	But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.
0.0	0.0794636401132	I love this country.
0.0	0.471002314136	Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
0.0	0.239285169438	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.

0.0	0.0511386621722	So you might not.
0.0	0.140273528182	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.482380691347	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.537564343619	We have to do away with the strawman proposal.
0.0	0.131101034877	Everybody thought it was a done deal.
0.0	0.251959174948	Check it out.

0.0	0.0614055519531	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.449173688073	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.0656672859967	We know about the Brits.

0.0	0.0137956184112	We serve you.

0.0	0.0630046118105	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.196465838631	It is.
0.0	0.305799665694	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.575607998201	They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.
0.0	0.320097256492	The simple fact is, we all have a record.
0.0	0.154686487309	And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world.
0.0	0.334818763174	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.115804757665	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.0239716062582	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.375036583623	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.0926385936146	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.211431667729	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.0785832037624	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.249099196862	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.0296320891249	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.225500789877	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.494036344844	But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.
0.0	0.178129015158	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.657919176646	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.27709049447	A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.
0.0	0.597555368481	That's American citizenship.
0.0	0.265634117075	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.0749218953037	I am not the candidate of Wall Street...
1.0	0.84088239288	The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.
0.0	0.695691749465	Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.
0.0	0.127817221801	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.368863550956	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.188040956524	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.442713320935	Get rid of the fraud.
0.0	0.36669878295	Yes.
0.0	0.0681858883254	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.490145361916	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.
0.0	0.134010202673	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
0.0	0.241953548899	How are these people gonna lead us?
0.0	0.162852022772	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.0907617892124	You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.
0.0	0.135896668844	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.10560978176	I learned so much.
0.0	0.160734653609	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.156260164289	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.802093724273	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.185120202106	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.0752275387259	Right.
0.0	0.17064568548	I do agree that in particular, Turkey and the Gulf nations have got to make up their minds.
0.0	0.263870197143	He cut and run.
0.0	0.234730179528	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.96317788569	They would have to pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.100352060687	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.216012894482	Let's get rid of Assad later.
0.0	0.157443055478	I think we all support that.
0.0	0.0174928733289	So they put together this.
0.0	0.260881310017	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.453268427793	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.369167982662	Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
0.0	0.147778388262	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.214555713976	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.0873004834746	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.915740801148	Bill.
0.0	0.851533387306	They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care.
0.0	0.60351625732	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.104667368641	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.0453804690242	You know, this is not easy work.
0.0	0.162195884726	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.354848157437	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.231467638499	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
0.0	0.299332243666	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.772063929527	Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.
0.0	0.0951945394626	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.216125250406	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.403261210471	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.488923253876	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
0.0	0.121142129427	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.0250650031849	...Thank you.
0.0	0.131069536744	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.30969559857	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.0330003638613	OK.
0.0	0.0752275387259	Right.
0.0	0.202987450781	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.366695881244	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.36591438815	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.142481251786	And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you're a governor.
0.0	0.271223166928	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.201396651714	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
0.0	0.208490169237	It's time for real substance and real experience.
1.0	0.999999161069	Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.
0.0	0.0516900668408	Just can't happen.
0.0	0.271379584982	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.248593589455	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.0582104792157	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.0620282771938	... issues they have to respond to.
0.0	0.0471459774661	I beat China all the time.
0.0	0.211400142769	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.180531116547	We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.
0.0	0.309643987134	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.0322845014467	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.289773992571	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.203644901771	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.340633209667	Very valuable.
0.0	0.00610321390616	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.284556144485	They kill us.
0.0	0.416954008195	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.209637080148	At the end of the day, if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities.
0.0	0.282209428509	And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.
0.0	0.937147064116	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.583016779054	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.5	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
0.0	0.112914841422	Thank you, John.

0.0	0.0935139044208	But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand.
0.0	0.329006972633	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.314749359903	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.18489934233	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.359794449019	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.23654976143	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.

0.0	0.193869917941	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.125982354798	But at the end of the day, no doubt, the Affordable Care Act is a step forward.
0.0	0.461618800325	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.318716945334	But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.

0.0	0.157047158863	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.576098147139	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.318175019356	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.

0.0	0.166014233469	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.213020075268	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.388305756659	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.0692699206564	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.937441891798	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.078481494633	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.198010846153	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.0953089978312	Today I heard it.
0.0	0.541166056041	So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again.
0.0	0.0451097568524	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.

0.0	0.545827867981	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.
0.0	0.0171969472399	I happen to think...
0.0	0.196465838631	What do we do?
0.0	0.309572639761	Al Qaida was based in Afghanistan.

0.0	0.36669878295	Yes.
0.0	0.0558119124177	Well, sure.
0.0	0.10805858659	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.424787857107	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.165806104752	I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.
0.0	0.348612536277	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.256682562079	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.169199426929	They thought something was wrong.
0.0	0.253520947431	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.193322730295	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.463458634235	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.171725864371	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.316442385371	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.192987794652	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
1.0	0.602841136133	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.306431123399	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.942818756112	I released 34 years of tax returns...
0.0	0.0719358934846	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.832721000052	Seventeen more million more people have health care.
0.0	0.177067444576	And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.
0.0	0.104247531458	It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino.
0.0	0.141041762423	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.122874599675	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.314060520984	And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
0.0	0.122279988358	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.159211576925	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.162071425922	I would prioritize them.
0.0	0.100420369054	The big banks--
0.0	0.856811521573	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.
0.0	0.0990177218263	But it cannot be an American fight.
0.0	0.130797620379	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.158628608117	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.230776472251	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.118847222588	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.150393979514	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.220243387207	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.0428974229832	You're right about that.
0.0	0.124642930273	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.
0.0	0.0273827176226	But we came together.
0.0	0.559307758332	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.0979910265778	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.281774420368	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.280362955055	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.314927204967	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.130740581174	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
0.0	0.174022303056	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.241092082622	I am glad Donald is running.
0.0	0.508258085772	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.030551174394	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.721983555211	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.165529997088	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.
0.0	0.277402110689	But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible.
0.0	0.519050347705	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.768386477921	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.162374743099	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.0747094304248	Now, this is getting to be fun.
0.0	0.179748637152	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.156758253337	They're building up their military to a point that is very scary.
0.0	0.218802635485	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.175705493574	I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.
0.0	0.137109860633	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.847433443519	We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
0.0	0.165454173057	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.157923466811	I mean, that's a fact.
0.0	0.199319947086	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.171291967459	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.0431131388945	Can we stop?
0.0	0.0106818828183	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.534029386491	I saw Ted Cruz say, "we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill."
0.0	0.34608816748	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.230836000472	It will give hope to millions of young people.
0.0	0.0599559240677	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.405754867833	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.117763559642	Well, thank you, John.
0.0	0.0352240909067	They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.
0.0	0.112319720185	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.562332543085	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.024053807567	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.196465838631	No, I have not.
0.0	0.309799593854	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	0.339219818103	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.73126753706	It was an investment bank.
0.0	0.272027765067	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.173397578526	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.555410726322	It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.
0.0	0.401195536256	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
0.0	0.127376285912	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.0448008069834	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.211290319754	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.417351844278	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.453185398351	First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster.
0.0	0.415764121766	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.27041906126	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.240829792298	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.171291967459	So, I thank you very much for that.
0.0	0.413858438986	This is what's made our nation so special.
0.0	0.127166601892	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.0439325892787	You really can't.
0.0	0.663349342641	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.219907045915	On two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago.
0.0	0.060080711399	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.315508356552	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.131489376059	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.174050665758	We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States.
0.0	0.0996107295092	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.0846729948104	Our next president...
0.0	0.894897206784	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.246910254653	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.430109336577	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.853578467902	Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server.
0.0	0.405150735337	But it was also the cascading effects that followed that.
0.0	0.890325125809	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.0448008069834	You know that.
0.0	0.0999110266176	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.760185583797	They are refusing to...

0.0	0.665658515334	I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.
0.0	0.303097224645	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.144678747383	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.221417949662	Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond...
0.0	0.128588099324	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.109360205183	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.1814097585	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.0481688784645	That can be done.
0.0	0.258516877362	We ought to send used equipment, right?
0.0	0.0964872059007	There won't be any -- you can get it.
0.0	0.432693214991	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.22861621279	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.0613012522669	That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.
0.0	0.280794381509	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.292798623914	He's the greatest show on earth.

0.0	0.150314452298	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.103756841286	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.374860432478	And we have people that are controlled by special interests.
0.0	0.0123324402871	Mr. President, we're not against you.

0.0	0.452149516702	The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.201978596339	The people aren't dumb.

0.0	0.300184612222	So, what we want to do is to say, look, we have 11 million people who have been here, many of them for decades.
0.0	0.590249904917	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.101319107971	Well, thanks for having me.
0.0	0.254616646197	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.

0.0	0.292731983949	Two weeks later, the place was blown up.
0.0	0.1314679282	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.802646460756	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.459711101058	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.394068983251	Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, who said my plan for what we should do to reign in Wall Street was more comprehensive and better.
0.0	0.271517794259	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.246206155083	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
0.0	0.47137946034	I believe that our Federal Government needs to do more on pell grants.

0.0	0.492210710633	May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care?
0.0	0.0102693678763	It's not great again.
0.0	0.643322723098	For example, it is outrageous that we don't have an opportunity for Medicare to negotiate for lower prices.
0.0	0.211532879475	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.
0.0	0.443227031067	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
1.0	0.997053992248	And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.072918072454	...before I go.
0.0	0.296640399362	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.140712828103	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.16897709414	Germany, many other countries do it already.
0.0	0.17909831368	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.382548772528	But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.
0.0	0.0690200951481	And guess what?
0.0	0.594042733694	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.0437482685127	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.439531702162	We got it done in my state by leading with principal and that's what we need to do as a party for comprehensive gun safety.
0.0	0.355149341847	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
1.0	0.6866505504	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.245507682642	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.0246451414544	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.0939905054806	We didn't spend any.
1.0	0.988506209874	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
0.0	0.0183562174432	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.418637716738	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.12018400893	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.0902585117719	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.297333795495	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.0940006071507	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.
0.0	0.180114091445	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.0986611435784	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.429107671633	It's a country in which people choose to buy guns.
0.0	0.243134619736	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.605640975372	That's what I said to my own public health people.
0.0	0.072639626862	Look, the secretary is right.
0.0	0.0355981472926	They knew that.
0.0	0.245252599237	And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.
0.0	0.204171561279	Yeah (ph), no, I think that's a -- that's a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques.
0.0	0.382233970615	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.435911128898	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.208682847264	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.620041214528	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.111678549448	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
0.0	0.870888489905	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
0.0	0.196465838631	No.
0.0	0.193852864343	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.0600683268357	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.347952351882	Let's reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.270351600076	Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.
0.0	0.373644669101	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.750855689262	Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor.
0.0	0.446794586088	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.415982879409	But I said, "Don't hit Iraq," because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East.
0.0	0.0777235690013	We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.
0.0	0.16424567684	I want to thank the people of Iowa for being so welcoming to me.
0.0	0.203677160203	We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president.
0.0	0.0317638863707	A step forward.
0.0	0.533789317419	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
1.0	0.925484475986	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
1.0	0.991441375451	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.640300084049	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.201798561335	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.166543865894	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.0969648575817	How are we gonna -- how are we gonna go back and make it great again?
0.0	0.33287875798	But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone.
0.0	0.879738589141	Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.
0.0	0.612715131657	And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.
0.0	0.100901276568	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.41025978207	And I apologize to nobody for that.
0.0	0.213440732042	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.0959584549272	And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.
0.0	0.679568369507	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.230117792306	They went to the DNC quietly.
0.0	0.305563402527	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.0941755939789	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.353309382384	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.175208927572	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.24641228867	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
0.0	0.372879503829	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.0491341421261	Good at email.
0.0	0.646262922614	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.475041632057	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.225591327215	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.196636868418	I...
0.0	0.105234247067	So nice, thank you very much.
0.0	0.151027669239	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.910458898012	He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration.
0.0	0.516150410753	But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
0.0	0.178604738028	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.54143513656	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.0361365899004	You can have him.
0.0	0.14888452475	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.687832553058	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.0566098748124	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.282657936202	That's calling it what it is.
0.0	0.13954898394	And it's-- it's a worthy debate.
0.0	0.699467579537	You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour.
1.0	0.301343895557	They built a hotel.
0.0	0.0808827150842	That is abundantly clear.
0.0	0.0577445852292	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.182503811239	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.179073378145	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.125257891266	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.329540064719	All of us believe climate change is real.
0.0	0.409901363743	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.0752275387259	All right.
0.0	0.196465838631	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.615849711245	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.161652682426	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.0600551574569	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.273469768341	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.0140952266003	We can't.
0.0	0.464449649777	We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents.
0.0	0.0726999842629	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.102903904358	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.127175434647	But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
0.0	0.149774891788	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.428126987887	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.0734173385418	So it is difficult.
0.0	0.0367710412136	Big difference.
0.0	0.323213267399	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.354915179464	Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons.
0.0	0.375892069279	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.1727387775	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.120279726795	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
0.0	0.107373059974	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.48147885918	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.
0.0	0.485810067107	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.264456665016	In addition to that...
0.0	0.252191163998	They are not going to go away on their own.
0.0	0.663708489069	First of all, yes, we've stolen.

0.0	0.485435089862	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.196465838631	What are we doing?
0.0	0.0682546257885	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.176641599958	And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave.
0.0	0.275405719159	And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.
1.0	0.999999991839	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.

0.0	0.127269863977	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.423180694847	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.0577604145417	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.152359335477	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.0638272836814	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.200343082637	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.154032516358	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.100763302993	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.320355002858	... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.791422635501	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.237386165885	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.248766982559	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.374622379668	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.59034576807	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.5	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.824265007221	He has never defended...
0.0	0.03841679315	And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen.
0.0	0.273735027094	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.27689691146	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.241472520839	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.264823486508	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.996111122503	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.783994728228	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
0.0	0.381411404964	You've got to go the extra mile.
0.0	0.0361365899004	You can do both.
0.0	0.0256102402795	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.168845775229	I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran.
0.0	0.196465838631	Why is it...
0.0	0.130458206041	And, the fact is, none of them.

0.0	0.010872020999	He was vibrant.
0.0	0.252025144446	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.143249885676	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
1.0	0.999999427249	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.00756675483078	How would we act?

0.0	0.0145520297717	Divide that out.
0.0	0.255821860472	I know every one.
0.0	0.651347552141	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.0552263576184	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.0989783739852	Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple.
0.0	0.0552874592859	Please think of our founding fathers as you listen.
0.0	0.349333291215	But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.
0.0	0.436331459046	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.260671784915	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.686316785858	I also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees.
0.0	0.123578571323	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.
0.0	0.395853404502	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.346652919125	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.349442663397	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.513926855745	I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.
0.0	0.261368077202	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.523196165467	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.

0.0	0.184046527051	Say again?
0.0	0.333078941623	I have a comprehensive, tough plan.
0.0	0.0124758246469	And, look, there are profound differences...
0.0	0.196465838631	Why?
0.0	0.0680356669646	They're not so stupid.
0.0	0.358965534679	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.172008446152	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.

1.0	0.988945289552	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
0.0	0.305840622282	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.796167611461	I voted against the war.
0.0	0.0758359171786	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.429878769056	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.220606363473	But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country.
0.0	0.0757282226487	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.0687515545786	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.304682032208	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.0710941423549	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.206862704908	Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.
0.0	0.219556946401	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.178889269082	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.427436148673	And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.175789973967	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.271622918905	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.651901251268	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.0770286726996	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.5	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.0932489677754	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.338887890279	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.214183213362	We have a lot of work to do, to better prepare our nation and to better lead this world into this new century.
0.0	0.288861845465	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.303884435371	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.87127626377	To get deregulated -- listen to this, they spent $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions over a 10-year period.
0.0	0.0768781790601	The formula is working.
0.0	0.156546640281	Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
0.0	0.0339556956107	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.559321889905	The number of women --
0.0	0.10546448727	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.468129699612	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.152872932907	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.199817745897	Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC.
1.0	0.334005971073	Twenty-one mass shootings, including one last weekend in Des Moins where three were murdered.
0.0	0.0448008069834	And you know what?
0.0	0.181301703829	We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?
0.0	0.217660918513	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.765145918084	Illegal.
0.0	0.176796641047	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.135671225772	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.155379007715	So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
0.0	0.0618899762052	That's who I'm indebted to.
0.0	0.287553543549	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.154631100623	You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.
1.0	0.708897293	$10.10 was all I could get the state to do by the time I left in my last year.
0.0	0.0884153842656	And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?
0.0	0.224297234742	And as our party's nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.217378195204	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.667625145414	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.0591936835479	There has never been a jihadist group like this.
0.0	0.319997232045	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.0572540864453	I do not think it would come to that.
0.0	0.170610621686	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.227750930287	They're sending us not the right people.
0.0	0.193812648244	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.184732970677	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.5	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.0650385353793	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.222658893548	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.194924288866	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.5425090562	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.421159504587	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.230625658946	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.394917328443	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.0481360942505	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.156537529388	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.162161486031	We also have to build a coalition at home.
0.0	0.306456019615	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.328678464212	So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.
0.0	0.163943482759	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.038203959051	I don't care.
0.0	0.31508456702	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.177472185102	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.
0.0	0.0133792956449	I have formed them.
0.0	0.204351858048	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.120474142567	I gotta build those big buildings.
0.0	0.00767132424911	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.416588619353	We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.
0.0	0.302106958534	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.056432200367	John?
0.0	0.370025860594	I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to -- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.
0.0	0.304627251029	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.263264080571	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.
0.0	0.670998389413	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.134959336637	We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.
0.0	0.180333698462	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.260236468226	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.254677308029	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.559052425662	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.121479265545	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.029415329583	it won't happen.
0.0	0.451099052335	So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.
0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.
0.0	0.238261458189	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.192641229898	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
1.0	0.975599354093	A $5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.369436657913	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.231722599535	And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting.
0.0	0.145175500195	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.269999302984	Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country -- we would never build in an ocean.
0.0	0.136223099535	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.176983525239	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.0334641289759	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.14479017834	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.0976665620234	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.159229335646	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.320830099638	They are not doing it now.
0.0	0.0687048114302	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.16456752539	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.35613869948	I was not the secretary of state...
0.0	0.221653033455	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.299193970878	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.308658930517	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.1755138634	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.105633806987	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.342840857791	It is enormously complicated.
1.0	0.999994819751	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.108938610708	I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.
0.0	0.0687382181238	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.556366354349	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.272791136852	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.
0.0	0.0974823245522	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.133205322379	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.196465838631	But...
0.0	0.0639559988096	Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.
0.0	0.2151702427	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.
0.0	0.70240197053	But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it.

0.0	0.1804151015	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.000485411802232	There's -- look, there's --

0.0	0.0702128324998	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.237605694205	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.147309864905	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
0.0	0.212567670008	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.

0.0	0.24568340574	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.322356065684	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.
0.0	0.155109136473	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.

0.0	0.27340967318	This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.
0.0	0.386499850678	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?

0.0	0.192281544264	I've dealt with them all my life.
0.0	0.256714061637	Now, let me just be clear, John.

0.0	0.132981652362	It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.
0.0	0.335448853503	So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.

0.0	0.170725613597	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.
0.0	0.106490895591	Wall Street today has too much political power.
0.0	0.523119471724	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.

0.0	0.353970642691	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
1.0	0.988153508902	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.43823016287	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.

0.0	0.10473288691	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.26510112479	At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically.
0.0	0.205011778708	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.0964987699335	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"

0.0	0.368891742371	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.0736526530846	So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.
0.0	0.592049287199	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.

0.0	0.977158094258	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.

0.0	0.182706475334	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.184894554114	He's wrong.
0.0	0.410884897532	And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process.
0.0	0.298265373164	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.347159453536	And the U.S. chamber of commerce, which hardly ever says nice things about Democratic governors anywhere, named our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship.
0.0	0.263186740925	At the same time we're doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform.
0.0	0.149926660235	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.299507235796	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.145745399079	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.129746642113	I will stand firm.

0.0	0.427381819901	And let me, by the way, take this moment to congratulate Hillary Clinton, who I thought not only did an outstanding job as our first lady, but redefined what that role could be.
0.0	0.809687595025	Yes, well, roughly.

0.0	0.0511188844228	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.0647920694073	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.559707451388	And also -- also, what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health care outcomes are not necessarily that good.
1.0	0.996834898919	Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world.

0.0	0.347237781181	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.36669878295	Yes.
0.0	0.124477873258	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.

0.0	0.461402171263	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.144547836858	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.

0.0	0.0609288878253	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.

0.0	0.191372639696	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.

0.0	0.134131211455	But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you.
0.0	0.118568812365	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.

0.0	0.0479214230814	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.041585915261	Wall Street is doing great.

0.0	0.350032599781	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.264714682431	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.256449109592	And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.
0.0	0.065704016507	We get a traitor.

0.0	0.631594936775	My daughters went to college on a mountain of bills.
0.0	0.314115314565	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.126896662408	The Secretary's obviously right.
0.0	0.334023729879	Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes.
0.0	0.0795637876439	I waited and I got the scars to show for it.
0.0	0.890542771023	We're spending over $600 billion a year on the military and yet, significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism.
0.0	0.229999043456	So the fact is that we work for the people.
0.0	0.34078612541	... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience.

0.0	0.48442525074	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.

0.0	0.112556487243	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?

0.0	0.111649748397	And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.
0.0	0.243628305131	And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence.
0.0	0.761358772442	We've enacted it in our state.

0.0	0.029415329583	It won't happen.

0.0	0.362537767106	They should have made it more open ended for the next president.
0.0	0.581553458243	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.339122809216	But guess who pushed for that regulation?

0.0	0.258656281681	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.118569277614	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.5	But I have another one, Ford.
0.0	0.0457564041776	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.516718945643	First of all...
0.0	0.106732119756	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.204183866029	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
0.0	0.30246716767	And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and I would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go.
0.0	0.126500040658	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.00520438910213	David...
0.0	0.654835606116	And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.
0.0	0.0218054486623	Neil...
0.0	0.697431054776	And we've got to do more on equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.444465518362	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.725930693838	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.427332485604	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.320830099638	We now have that.
0.0	0.19125879706	This is an emergency.
0.0	0.778848743716	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.207896892684	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.444544700875	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.291322312877	He was putting his 10 and 12-year-old boys to bed the other night.
0.0	0.620589375975	They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?
0.0	0.355875866397	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.00359853591745	He's very charming.
0.0	0.0600551574569	Don't believe it.
1.0	0.77761918575	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.585684653152	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.0414719288235	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.133137562446	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.607483333996	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.389675712911	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.245744720116	Obama is going to be out playing golf.
0.0	0.33293601493	And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.
0.0	0.289061523776	Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.114808182616	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.170730788534	Yeah, but let me respond...
0.0	0.140148878772	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.820098788068	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
0.0	0.0697684606925	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.30207378213	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.272506106199	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.185729991112	We cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of moral nations around this Earth, we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats, because Martha, this will not be the last region where nation-states fail.
0.0	0.209180022436	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.0767467070012	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.271015370638	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.975913861813	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.142245385478	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.196465838631	No their not.
0.0	0.0784777528039	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.
1.0	0.999999246439	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.127261164022	And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.
0.0	0.672902003763	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.0981005969604	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.067785583289	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.151402183513	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.17915003922	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.12662205033	We have to get the remaining 10.

0.0	0.180142090483	in particular.
0.0	0.299646817869	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.471405470165	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.423143154677	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.193981092513	Making fun of disabled people...
0.0	0.489133324019	I think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12 it would be the highest historical average we've ever had.
0.0	0.106726892402	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.861327024433	We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government.
0.0	0.150689623394	I didn't say permanently.
1.0	0.999999683991	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.760724261274	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.
0.0	0.207771411913	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.390469738431	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.873122585083	Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent.
0.0	0.128716317196	And most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that.
0.0	0.589983761468	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.0972113125993	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.180917816884	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.0741275711755	This is a war for the soul of Islam.

0.0	0.322206175929	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.212324337361	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.492301089851	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.
0.0	0.233522966543	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.136677462392	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.151173194654	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.258337822327	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.141207529861	You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster.
0.0	0.608154903161	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.435190313199	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.00463614874634	He's not a leader.
0.0	0.109744094048	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.0753333739385	Marco can change his mind.
0.0	0.288601439061	If we are not successful, if we continue the same old, same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big-money interests, nothing changes.
0.0	0.274514178413	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.365827908721	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.0752275387259	Right?
0.0	0.692513282963	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.189649123307	We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.
0.0	0.196465838631	Not at all.
0.0	0.5	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.196465838631	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.659221883545	I do respect Rand.
0.0	0.034536395274	That makes no sense at all.
0.0	0.329444676099	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.366041510987	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.130649119594	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.959142967101	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.0390207440324	They will not.
0.0	0.161026086807	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.267307869108	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
0.0	0.409003217503	We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love -- they're great -- all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.
0.0	0.160070991635	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.115229131352	I will work my heart out.
0.0	0.196465838631	I have...
0.0	0.494731538016	And so, you go the extra mile.
0.0	0.0505918852141	We don't have victories anymore.
0.0	0.0289360515747	Excuse me.
0.0	0.290341458747	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.301541365388	When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war.
0.0	0.657269292818	Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.
0.0	0.0341411202897	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.379000450012	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.0435895677613	And we're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.377402821565	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0743492009549	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.305331436053	The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.
1.0	0.981114485632	And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.
0.0	0.196983338194	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.0362188233265	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.
0.0	0.0309002221861	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.199543410734	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.490621270101	It's a divided country on guns.
0.0	0.0367765065209	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.11082712338	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.190168868959	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.170652107563	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
0.0	0.537230045133	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.633603644174	That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
0.0	0.257634800552	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.
0.0	0.0334508187676	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.0474254494089	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.341949742099	That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive.
0.0	0.15126438377	This will end.
0.0	0.038403310235	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.13921873232	We never dreamt we'd ever see it."
0.0	0.405633185931	I was for legalization.
1.0	0.826484012543	We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.118043457641	Credibility counts.
1.0	0.556905660632	I did introduce legislation to reign in compensation.
0.0	0.130942301682	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.209151062061	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.0860664801922	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.
0.0	0.191628921895	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.334918161282	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.487110780353	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.
0.0	0.39309227549	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.0915068566671	That is the clear and present danger.
0.0	0.293273101122	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.20640432463	We need sound money.
0.0	0.129967741567	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.510094556897	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.335118906758	But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
0.0	0.30262510263	Let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.196465838631	2,000?
0.0	0.149467197835	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.0752275387259	Right.
0.0	0.118186115563	We've got to hate the Muslims."
0.0	0.12056238829	I would invite him, I actually would say.
0.0	0.161427184136	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.457056680715	We need money.
0.0	0.236889510465	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.09835040706	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.348968370007	How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years.
0.0	0.0383839586835	We're dying.
1.0	0.517355043199	According to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.137614631902	As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.342717317658	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.105415760142	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.115602874861	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.155635728637	And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.
0.0	0.0322526125479	We did a lot to help.
0.0	0.178255804941	I said, "Is he intelligent?"
0.0	0.196465838631	That is what we have to do.
0.0	0.0578706778948	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.53827732617	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.0129053838506	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.0501989181329	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.216417954392	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.148512995723	How are they going to beat ISIS?
0.0	0.057244126458	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.75375210963	At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.
1.0	0.9531766956	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.45949100052	But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.

0.0	0.321020313091	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.541905167733	That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.
0.0	0.562538201086	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.084278617472	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.335211237191	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.5	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.204650479736	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.743982402075	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.640033698387	And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.
0.0	0.245087358428	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.
0.0	0.15611084911	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.

0.0	0.189089764464	I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism --
0.0	0.0599711939775	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.147653727405	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.373348409571	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.0786263299178	I don't think we're at war with all Muslims.
0.0	0.0150815738061	We need a doer, not a talker.

0.0	0.159572289312	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.429917738437	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.0404755982593	I agree completely.

0.0	0.623389787499	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.0778901261665	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.620877900318	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.0089360306667	They're not good.
0.0	0.0598590776542	And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
0.0	0.432116563851	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.316407049711	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.384159148358	KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.
0.0	0.376053069848	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.194922805065	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.
0.0	0.590082110422	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.405386898628	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.372727657922	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.391292024582	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.646829725034	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.

0.0	0.781396148422	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.0669467893398	That I can tell you.
0.0	0.76247082861	I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.
0.0	0.374999121391	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.320506313951	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.0473631405713	You get a lot of them that are overrated.

0.0	0.308691273555	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.745209507256	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.306127267774	The NSA is another big issue.
0.0	0.257828602024	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.258616288527	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.135881726871	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
1.0	0.938403221679	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.124409963089	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.0857886267546	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.288422609281	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.650353731898	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.364671315129	When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up.
0.0	0.143829342675	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.200099989766	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
0.0	0.205318205131	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.0765622157246	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.149974192114	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.425308830633	And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.
0.0	0.475224835029	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.214259055148	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.428957828042	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.757879908181	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.0350482094151	It is a tragedy all over this country.
0.0	0.280902758267	I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video.
0.0	0.0448030197171	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.103831416981	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.153118820894	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.346439378763	We went after those who had attacked us.
0.0	0.298018760009	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.874025807999	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.418324908065	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.134118033805	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
1.0	0.971641684539	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
0.0	0.0503556269562	I don't think so.
0.0	0.526355156294	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.139013177724	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.348593443747	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.159969465267	You can -- you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.
0.0	0.119976242111	Man (ph), their mother's here as well.
0.0	0.516040704623	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.285179218569	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.27175302499	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.625775558793	But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks.
0.0	0.0214628539598	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.019789669488	Washington is broken.
1.0	0.962037819273	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.434491680355	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
0.0	0.209397956834	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.274321881967	That's a drag on the economy.
0.0	0.389221685851	This entire question was an attack, but that's (inaudible)
0.0	0.164627806696	Those are all really positive developments.
0.0	0.399074646202	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
1.0	0.82902120171	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.224885295796	We talked about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.255391833625	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
0.0	0.121454096406	And that's not what's happening now.
1.0	0.859077448613	People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.
0.0	0.0615715232274	There's been no crowd like this.
0.0	0.190650173893	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.185860062043	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.115385423208	Now, here's what is going to happen.
0.0	0.154454521701	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.093214969965	You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America.
0.0	0.52189622717	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.274499840829	And, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like Gadhafi, a despot with American blood on his hands, is overturned.
0.0	0.196465838631	You did.
0.0	0.226778355359	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.95220428672	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.135229444268	There's too much -- it's like -- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
0.0	0.14767589997	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.0394341852379	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.287745106815	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.134960133883	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.102389996236	But what -- I will tell you this.
0.0	0.156098193712	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.0679510880664	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.393362182732	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.00715594666542	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.614699915192	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.489585782792	... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.374765215822	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.430143380106	We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.
0.0	0.342460768985	Fact check me.
0.0	0.0736120686807	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.776862968735	He's been a negative force.
0.0	0.431675077877	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.296881733927	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.00351212846486	They're off to China.
0.0	0.152759002288	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.250436642248	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.154293557574	On January 20th, 2017, the next president of the United States will walk into the White House.
0.0	0.0607510737731	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.906156878272	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
1.0	0.919758956115	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.276236631661	I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones.
0.0	0.527278959164	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.0405797399766	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.251069948418	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.273362557641	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.486009077927	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.19131515911	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.994577122902	So the total is $8,737,540,00.
0.0	0.700672007879	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.20010159427	Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC.
1.0	0.630545443256	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.0374097559348	Wait for what?
0.0	0.329217024347	We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy.
0.0	0.139370580019	You know why three?
0.0	0.391741657547	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.328763131947	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
0.0	0.337446035685	I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.110820849268	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.123228111626	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.190476265485	Whoever heard of this?
0.0	0.125984963977	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.218796517719	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.365496176119	The central question in this race is trust.
0.0	0.255712545877	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.68576011052	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.0637960666027	Well, they're glitches because...
0.0	0.452741380376	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.196465838631	That has not been...
0.0	0.0913910535091	I'd suggest people take a look at it.
0.0	0.202966719293	White people?
0.0	0.119963050581	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.163863437114	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.289101104135	Marco opposed this because they made a deal.
0.0	0.142054363918	One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this, is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations.
0.0	0.0608865301695	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.346843310141	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.979353039033	...10% flat rate...

0.0	0.117742830757	Well, I would just repeat that.
0.0	0.0544860188877	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.0601602666557	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.

0.0	0.16764755348	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.239879907764	Parents, and sons, and daughters and family members, and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them, we must remember this, that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century.

0.0	0.119178767343	I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary...
0.0	0.592578826419	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.

0.0	0.754545882174	He's actually a negative force.

0.0	0.144232509613	Somebody said -- thank you, darlin'.
0.0	0.137318696251	... we will secure the border...
0.0	0.238488954978	Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground.
0.0	0.348293684094	This is not the type of campaign that we run.
0.0	0.516011139778	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
1.0	0.78246860071	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
0.0	0.286823147082	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.226025278271	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.

0.0	0.439006185506	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.362598373858	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
1.0	0.999999969465	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.300137857931	Go on to my website.
0.0	0.0196310167186	You're certainly not very good.
0.0	0.243812342076	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
0.0	0.0790741428984	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.144370486137	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.0579623302591	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.194319983482	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.0367003011788	And there are many ways of doing it.
1.0	0.999999131677	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.189383443109	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.0658310592301	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.357361052079	... and I think -- you know, Governor -- Jeb, you -- the attack that -- the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS.
0.0	0.0503556269562	So I don't think...
0.0	0.031422833854	Absolutely.
0.0	0.0620756725444	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.152905856334	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.184841966285	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.314233912097	But this is what we also have to say.
0.0	0.383442619488	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.399179394048	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.125952627883	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.31636110451	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.206846194442	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.383304527236	And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.
0.0	0.255368127859	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.224162919339	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.146925971743	May I respond to the critique on the ...
0.0	0.00615438600084	I love China.
0.0	0.372067730486	He undermines it.
0.0	0.512194669191	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.346755076689	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.295461844471	First priority, destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.347375767637	And we ought to fight them on that level.
0.0	0.149051657541	I would change them.
0.0	0.128324179808	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.00691475371499	Wow.
0.0	0.437727740035	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.174212207156	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
0.0	0.236171466932	Wall Street is a threat to the economy.
0.0	0.507811825819	Who are we kidding?
0.0	0.0260406601569	Please go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.204211596433	And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.
0.0	0.031422833854	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.100477888437	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.
0.0	0.0406324424128	We don't need that.
0.0	0.185961344898	And the world, no doubt is a better place without him.
0.0	0.348766662565	It goes away.
0.0	0.299802425703	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.233893427596	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.119143890533	Yes, I'm getting...
1.0	0.997347019336	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.0508458671974	How has it worked?
1.0	0.919183195176	And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions.
0.0	0.345149181554	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.116272493629	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.
0.0	0.466910895743	They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.
1.0	0.960520341939	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
0.0	0.088377929118	I gotta do it, Dad.
0.0	0.0228754414958	That's the good news.
0.0	0.316414676708	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.143405558473	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.33081708076	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.303151999131	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.550563736152	And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.
0.0	0.202606105161	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.399630666015	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.13632721906	She's an American citizen.
0.0	0.397522447665	I didn't inherit any money.
1.0	0.339332278334	We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.24449521849	As president, I will support law enforcement and we'll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community.
0.0	0.301334121395	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.469986305488	And he asked me to support that.
0.0	0.0393258653373	I think what is...
0.0	0.967570052511	Real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years.
0.0	0.357063936138	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.0278115650583	He can't have it both ways.
0.0	0.201457295825	You can't be in favor of defend us...
0.0	0.135954112858	We need new leadership.
0.0	0.200825914217	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.260694319126	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.0939361490073	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
1.0	0.999995707958	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.372795709117	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.204167238991	And, here's what she said to the American people.
0.0	0.132258729648	One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy.
0.0	0.158361665145	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.5	No, both the federal and a state approach.
0.0	0.225556784976	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
1.0	0.972631216003	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
0.0	0.306952517254	And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
0.0	0.202459538994	No, it's true.
0.0	0.239210668213	I give a lot of money away to charities and other things.
0.0	0.225354980104	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
1.0	0.973364466066	Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.
0.0	0.111488801404	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.361064858011	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.0959589044506	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.723538050566	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.305132382122	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.257672976035	Can I share this quick story?
0.0	0.170029807496	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.634451389461	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.196465838631	I do.
0.0	0.380177205733	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.
0.0	0.451432618419	And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.
0.0	0.192361979893	And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.
0.0	0.248758057818	Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said.
0.0	0.267568390096	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.145586316083	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.0866957491772	You know, Ted didn't show up.
0.0	0.141650236157	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.251753678442	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.
0.0	0.151584392924	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.00442014865739	You find me...
0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.
0.0	0.122729920158	They wouldn't be there except for us.
0.0	0.194799601104	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.162736057196	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.809426666646	We ended up with 56 votes.
0.0	0.0739328717371	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.287767069376	I never said that.
0.0	0.200378262689	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.264100229208	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
1.0	0.977615526972	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.261269370987	That is the issue.
0.0	0.0691514546713	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.151797103609	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.121106129961	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.117828547948	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.149482801333	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.211710928855	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.418153008338	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.715647741909	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.183677827048	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.0612750406687	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.0785465602577	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.0507357458199	What would we do if this were ebola?
0.0	0.156808714272	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.410253771853	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.722542598883	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.
0.0	0.18746132966	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.202976864923	If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs.
0.0	0.0702807645771	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.383536917639	I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.
0.0	0.525404004132	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.169570975887	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.139335666507	A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.
0.0	0.304497350909	The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign.
0.0	0.408397199035	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.505281893161	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.189355712478	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.20907897834	We have tremendous people.
0.0	0.24511141023	And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.
0.0	0.296613761659	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.539210083526	Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems.
0.0	0.113427136386	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.214804491219	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
0.0	0.167286453735	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.662327586154	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.174210243876	You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country.
0.0	0.222774842478	That's fine.
0.0	0.348912229408	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.133288342211	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.0367765065209	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.00930350101658	We haven't.
0.0	0.519681553792	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.227997139448	These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy, and our economic power in alignment with our principles.
0.0	0.033581170602	I'm ready.
0.0	0.00901596477176	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.0385775895291	We have to come together as a country.
0.0	0.947914883212	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.414660223141	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.119488820609	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.22694460086	I'd sign that executive order.
1.0	0.972685313337	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.567286436325	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.157502972668	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.339224478383	So I believe that, in fact, this country needs to move towards a living wage.
0.0	0.621715823421	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.139370580019	You know why three?
0.0	0.534454301673	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.120626869018	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.0301188367597	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.
0.0	0.00328753591666	I like China.
0.0	0.530864109084	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.
0.0	0.220776905362	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.106915144783	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.194044847669	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
1.0	0.991443323967	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.139375957548	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.5	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.
0.0	0.270808388336	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.140404502989	I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.0689895193219	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.146442521572	I've had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say, I don't agree with you on everything, but I like what you do.
0.0	0.219283256753	Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees.
0.0	0.205161626616	They will be our early warning signal.
0.0	0.120276797173	I'm the only person...
0.0	0.157980791954	I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart.
0.0	0.0606208865328	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.37317778733	And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians, who are also flying in that space.
0.0	0.211766337549	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.295681911306	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.158653837828	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.0897191724086	Let's...
0.0	0.125522943863	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.
0.0	0.14578931761	I believe that the goal should be debt-free college.
0.0	0.510191008399	But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.
0.0	0.6050494426	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.353316248173	Got to go to Haiti last year.
0.0	0.331979034167	But actually I am.
0.0	0.355280534046	Yes, and it was the same one that President Obama made.
0.0	0.470097678808	and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States.
0.0	0.0370637069579	Well, I did.
0.0	0.883512751065	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.61672117015	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.159381738991	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.298564951542	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.319362382153	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
0.0	0.27684039047	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.551639619538	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.32143366302	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.438099075496	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.0590675257606	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.520350021829	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.854469627247	Of course.
0.0	0.60935524971	And that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums.
0.0	0.874166374989	First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty.
0.0	0.110371633398	So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
0.0	0.916016655952	Trillions of dollars have gone from the middle class and working families to the top one-tenth of one percent who have doubled the percentage of wealth they now own.
0.0	0.467027107534	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.728968119902	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
0.0	0.343399761576	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.543965380095	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.171143172034	Right there, right next to the plant.
1.0	0.862889495911	$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work.
0.0	0.618988369953	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.577748774709	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.364660114004	Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military.
0.0	0.0233375558576	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.475901185636	You cannot grant amnesty.
0.0	0.760775306663	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.138998388418	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.0760115768201	Well, I'll tell you who is on my side.
0.0	0.0957420385046	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.169232860883	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.154790298493	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.20764000317	We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
0.0	0.11730749898	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.163548202222	And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.
0.0	0.095896132214	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.23693140239	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.234641772724	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.196465838631	Why is that?
0.0	0.0909256888336	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.203069555639	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.270823017928	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.0854111068351	I've done it.
0.0	0.328001619857	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
1.0	0.128579021332	They're bringing crime.
0.0	0.0614294780847	You know, I've always had a great deal of respect.
0.0	0.152114290366	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.272370141352	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.728841897982	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.196738943908	And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them.
0.0	0.048802176097	My point is this.
0.0	0.439910908256	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.256911269223	Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem.
0.0	0.141910039844	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.407128211938	And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans.
0.0	0.104649544286	He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
0.0	0.0185320918799	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.
0.0	0.37826918958	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.0105824380708	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.483253988399	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.721971343323	I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money.
0.0	0.111268983357	You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying.
0.0	0.645627189816	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.240164503595	Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.
0.0	0.142948093573	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.134561002693	Common Core should -- it is a disaster.
0.0	0.287263145818	It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.
0.0	0.251943154431	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.369379064312	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.284138908266	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.309947613552	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.162848033905	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.452532860342	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.0453647826573	But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.235423114587	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.357854775268	Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world.
0.0	0.908646166912	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.160755588799	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.267772975793	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.229996620818	We have people that aren't working.
0.0	0.201631274189	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.132165935617	They sweated like dogs.
0.0	0.178476815178	... and I encourage everybody watching this tonight to please, acknowledge that by going online at martinomalley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism.
0.0	0.407066429134	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.616538700313	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.100107260125	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.370724987373	She has devoted her life, when I was mayor of the city of Burlington, actually when I first met her, we started a youth office, which started a after-school programs for kids, started a child care center, started a youth newspaper.
0.0	0.22485979997	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.37171521183	John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL, and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening.
0.0	0.0752275387259	Right.
0.0	0.100424598652	Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president.
0.0	0.331979034167	We actually did it.
0.0	0.425425583639	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.517536556233	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.646529936535	By actually doing more for education.
0.0	0.13608419194	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.152702824427	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.563825594902	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.440836393216	I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college.
0.0	0.238935558776	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.380219829441	Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.
0.0	0.124190710813	So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has.
0.0	0.144714770274	... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message.
0.0	0.184234826024	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.524056097942	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.113101109017	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.0402038357259	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.144111705314	I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.
0.0	0.492937432541	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.163838736929	And, of course, I met the mothers of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, and Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and so many of them who have lost their children.
0.0	0.431641811604	In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men.
0.0	0.486447527422	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
1.0	0.944150721142	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.428503217782	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.160477321161	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.0765622157246	Here's what I believe.
0.0	0.202459538994	That's not true.
0.0	0.0557717653397	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.
0.0	0.449777463994	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
1.0	0.98629809522	We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.
0.0	0.0595518180104	They have no choice.
0.0	0.397829755884	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.37704006048	They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.
1.0	0.961057521002	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.134814690465	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.
0.0	0.176482703935	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.0108863744868	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.289798539294	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.465204590442	We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force.
0.0	0.0134734068434	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.0503556269562	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.0164048984952	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.253803127463	Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
1.0	0.628009166651	But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works.
0.0	0.389548430181	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.209821064508	Good company.... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in -- and I wouldn't even use -- you know, I have -- I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
0.0	0.233892635179	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.1364241415	Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy.
0.0	0.512717745587	So I said, "That's OK." I'm proud of my net worth.
0.0	0.0690200951481	And guess what?
0.0	0.134480616713	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
1.0	0.972694522509	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.836825717612	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.147606223889	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.249148472331	That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities.
0.0	0.464137103494	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.145301100452	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.181497068878	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.0554626517758	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.870466414132	If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.
0.0	0.410512543622	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.113100349991	Well, I think it's pretty clear that they know that I will.
0.0	0.126741191033	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.110134771705	We both have a lot of small donors.

0.0	0.0140952266003	They can't.
1.0	0.542343270167	It's never below zero.
0.0	0.362397873474	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.

0.0	0.00615438600084	I love China.
0.0	0.118785474035	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.0678862032714	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.165692385814	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.230021501725	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.690776468749	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.15535499156	Well, I mean right here.
1.0	0.565979195125	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty, and we're the only country in the world -- virtually the only country that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.529950935332	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.470199296658	You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
0.0	0.390790165502	So there's more to my plan than just the cap.
0.0	0.317260678885	The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.
0.0	0.361805237862	In terms of Wall Street, I respectfully disagree with you, madam secretary, in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth.
0.0	0.38573771436	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.241173669743	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.276781233242	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.147837804004	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.0752275387259	Right.
0.0	0.304657799456	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.381964775676	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
0.0	0.11018535337	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.0512333573613	Sadly, the American dream is dead.
0.0	0.110299716976	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.188128326722	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.113853423159	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.243349078522	I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up.
0.0	0.11288851699	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.437592982364	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.860117060193	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.143960468751	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
0.0	0.842205591831	And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.
0.0	0.352783950029	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.190593112231	How stupid are they?
0.0	0.24458457155	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.
0.0	0.313173958279	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.183824271781	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.414136669854	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.1142037783	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.634271979894	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.

0.0	0.663886171445	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
0.0	0.736503735211	Millions coming out of school as you indicated, deeply in debt.
0.0	0.239856250776	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.398868795747	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.143257814001	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
0.0	0.21470236851	It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
0.0	0.059560679824	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.252319858863	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.237521917344	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.204226753053	The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.

0.0	0.523254980947	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.342121891139	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.234186337469	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.164976447213	We saw that in Egypt.
0.0	0.188671640969	The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.
0.0	0.0169176158046	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.0781087834337	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.453164340348	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.298812448894	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.584271389696	Secretary Clinton is right.
0.0	0.292670596743	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.595871972391	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.0959807654335	I want security.
0.0	0.196981152828	For her convenience.
0.0	0.238102576797	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.181850515488	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.474393261454	Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody.
0.0	0.06192382531	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.419177738912	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.0757998356077	People say, "Oh, you don't like China?"
0.0	0.700789328334	Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers.
0.0	0.0105867946711	Look at my family.
0.0	0.303443772732	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.444344085616	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.242664698604	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.635949096993	Kathie, that is the kind of economy I believe, put money in the hands of working people, raise the minimum wage to 15 buck an hour.
0.0	0.412332009486	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.357364380421	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
0.0	0.435366466186	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.29003142431	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.105988264097	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.0856442378412	Afghanistan is a mess.
0.0	0.282480361762	You've got to be on top of it.
0.0	0.225918094229	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.
0.0	0.094774747839	What are you going to do for my kids?
0.0	0.640268579965	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.243857731888	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.238377438406	That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.
0.0	0.276764039498	We'll be filing it right on time.
0.0	0.439657189677	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
0.0	0.177812860768	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.00681203522285	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.284755233317	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.347765107793	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.161289802688	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.372738978578	They like to ask direct questions.
0.0	0.221673591004	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
1.0	0.819945505968	And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent.
0.0	0.0794338320827	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.265057494659	No interest," because I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.356307315289	And it has three parts.
0.0	0.37863397514	I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.
0.0	0.126427999363	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.436237480988	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.206001597972	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
0.0	0.440155997921	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.0466203720618	Did a couple of cataract surgeries over Christmas holidays.
0.0	0.249438711974	I don't know and with all due respect to the secretary, Wall Street played by the rules?
0.0	0.0241578784594	But you know what else they're anxious about?
0.0	0.469421808314	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.313484985069	It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably -- probably -- from the Middle East.
0.0	0.169759297543	That is why we need to make police -- and I speak as a former mayor.
0.0	0.21636065	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.512653756118	I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.
0.0	0.648904745898	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.35003944087	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.0370112796441	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.102219396341	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.0251047459806	But I learned a lot.
0.0	0.855033090477	They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.
0.0	0.381226930106	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.172393415505	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.0895674870554	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.123726648153	I would just...
0.0	0.0330003638613	OK?
0.0	0.239371337928	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
0.0	0.0707327231902	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.1475290002	I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.
0.0	0.184211804866	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.195366633107	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.236859731009	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.0796478259564	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.377477311065	The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court?
0.0	0.279279482449	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.104407420072	And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.
0.0	0.0341892738235	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.0393258653373	Think about it.
0.0	0.281535981751	The endorsements that I'm proud of are conservative leaders like Dr. James Dobson, and over 700,000 contributions nationwide, people going to our Web site, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.900828818554	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.370926310955	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.346111020219	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.384374559874	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.135989395685	And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that.
0.0	0.404304327304	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.0196783492733	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.215203778174	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.196465838631	No.
0.0	0.506355281984	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.118623377376	So I would say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.072918072454	Go on to martinomalley.com.
0.0	0.371639597622	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.0338930603973	So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there.
0.0	0.0934350249781	But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything -- everything, they got away with it again.
0.0	0.2071765647	But states need to do more as well.
0.0	0.36385861441	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.62888942242	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.0821783400628	He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, "No interest."
0.0	0.161662696018	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.429553464547	Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.
0.0	0.204169852029	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.147635739245	Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take.
0.0	0.614868576795	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.0807486253377	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.736218737197	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.0888466666981	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.107670425801	Let me just...
0.0	0.124672293307	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.144120148408	And it's impossible for our people here to compete.
1.0	0.307030436797	We owe Japan more than that.
0.0	0.190168868959	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.0379512069938	There are thing that can be done.
0.0	0.00610321390616	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.368461018024	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.18178039868	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.079045077473	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.0217783617816	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.0703159505534	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.754540859082	I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...
0.0	0.262327839229	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.
0.0	0.122469343172	But let's be clear.
0.0	0.333089567309	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.291689474289	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.081536279647	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.0834315063722	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.196465838631	No.
0.0	0.640986538982	Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.
0.0	0.639227834627	... and 85 percent of gun owners agree.
0.0	0.00395436405824	You looking at me?
0.0	0.0346644039522	I understand.
0.0	0.012120764164	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.734643835713	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
0.0	0.296512917124	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.0524811118164	So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.
0.0	0.220650279346	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.304139651443	Against the Republican leadership, who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies.
0.0	0.194813332762	Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.
0.0	0.368755053663	What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years.
0.0	0.22720325171	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.0471201343503	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.0651863600626	Does anyone know this?"
0.0	0.72376852267	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.155552263275	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.570621550402	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.10986646203	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.329599994313	I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider.
0.0	0.39300590137	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.
0.0	0.189038452982	It's very important we operate on both at the same time.
0.0	0.556103547631	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.336078008904	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.148855297143	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.136597591155	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.199530306097	You have all of these disastrous airports.
0.0	0.171024489481	A few days ago a similar incident happened.
0.0	0.14719783175	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.317559975072	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.643161869172	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.341050532135	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.0155593853774	And he is a proud American Muslim.
0.0	0.381772609169	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.0202207827563	It's not a bestseller.
1.0	0.580291059466	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.115045466837	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.125466904818	Wait a minute.
0.0	0.0140952266003	We can't do it.
0.0	0.392274027057	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.
0.0	0.185985336616	Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid.
0.0	0.196465838631	...
0.0	0.656856337069	We can end welfare for those here illegally.
0.0	0.0455343388194	We can build the fence.
0.0	0.0380854813237	I'm getting to that.
0.0	0.0466441408317	And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party, but of President Obama.
0.0	0.568275578977	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.266978536936	It's virtually useless.
0.0	0.06770981761	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
0.0	0.454261442452	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.212403116671	We actually took action to do these things and as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families.
0.0	0.194702402462	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
0.0	0.0877357374694	I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.
0.0	0.305320798759	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.621433159883	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.0179834358798	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.0167506101142	That's good.
0.0	0.0846977478773	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.102837494056	I said, "I don't need it.
0.0	0.201316153858	He'll say, "Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico."
0.0	0.0231649836656	And I hear their speeches.
0.0	0.0894266763587	Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.
0.0	0.71349259705	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.317703768237	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
0.0	0.0791615219148	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.333408719176	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.010801896558	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.55413281445	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.350530639128	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.
0.0	0.134025962919	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.147514616201	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.175508236075	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.234922383735	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.269111544994	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.148897667535	And there is a lot we can do in college affordability.
0.0	0.20640432463	We need sound money.
0.0	0.244287344958	Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid.
0.0	0.263669668287	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.954344055388	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.169830626114	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
1.0	0.994288599157	ISIL videos, ISIL training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in America is at a gun show.
0.0	0.0179937735872	We have to do something.
0.0	0.261945540961	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.195239530033	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.329345299032	And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.
0.0	0.284039844712	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.102992446939	It -- it doesn't need to be that way.
0.0	0.221934513235	I'm tested.
0.0	0.12570977392	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.479844461743	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.112039031411	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.104272128734	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.56585926318	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.293118498599	They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.
0.0	0.847290552032	Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.
0.0	0.0393258653373	I think that is...
0.0	0.133292124605	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.557300279807	We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.197200992232	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.5818439051	We have people that have no incentive to work.
0.0	0.161923705437	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.190309329129	When you come back to me, I'll share that story.
0.0	0.342909160196	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.197479159509	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.109017442289	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.399928920179	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.242334017493	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.859630336765	And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.931027836853	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.369366982588	And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.
1.0	0.919835414979	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.122543457375	David, I am the very first...
0.0	0.105867016205	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.196465838631	...
0.0	0.29490766507	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.272343004119	From top to bottom.
0.0	0.166159712041	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.789947682746	We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations.
0.0	0.171891475276	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.
0.0	0.354163479887	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.0590922081228	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.061503203176	She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.
0.0	0.0358209747967	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.117326376475	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.455661806461	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.263679576566	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.630512419652	I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.
0.0	0.630591759049	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.0987407943004	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.794953660999	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.253941954274	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.0471552324165	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.988879904761	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.2269322094	Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice.
0.0	0.0152391218587	There is a vacuum.
0.0	0.130963926834	Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months.
0.0	0.108351668564	And America's best days are in front of us if we move forward together.
0.0	0.259582780076	And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.
0.0	0.248027090213	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.
0.0	0.0447877962395	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.118164026442	... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before.
0.0	0.097476234061	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.14322217649	Terrorism in this country scares everyone.
0.0	0.454750040765	We can in fact create jobs and provide job security.
0.0	0.15190630723	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
0.0	0.106704871564	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.118484255063	Both served.
0.0	0.0830863416692	And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.
0.0	0.289745237844	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.259023745002	And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.290516358119	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.129313837948	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.372872717002	I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
0.0	0.208128776001	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
0.0	0.211059246494	Martha, we offered a lot more than they were willing to take.
0.0	0.237737535943	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.315317691214	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.0934536059628	And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president.
0.0	0.0845865809819	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.96925993827	Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.
0.0	0.314594502503	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.68065129486	And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.
0.0	0.97905191831	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.201242379139	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.13199814388	You learn that threats always change.
0.0	0.154534646777	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.511328753233	I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.
0.0	0.106082595579	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.393297911689	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.47629548748	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.0340816673672	I win.
0.0	0.231655762955	So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
0.0	0.286147775511	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.342975315395	But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.56402725881	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.0161728667589	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.16174597495	Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us.
0.0	0.035464356268	Our president doesn't have a clue.
0.0	0.197207614113	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.099005206542	And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.
0.0	0.161828526374	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.21421934527	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.

0.0	0.314242305041	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.

0.0	0.335410593629	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.00389885382388	I feel like...
0.0	0.125544870794	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.0317638863707	It is a step forward.

0.0	0.138519237794	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.170139772846	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.

0.0	0.0602770636671	But you don't hear that from anybody else.
0.0	0.548118092027	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.0250650031849	Thank you.
0.0	0.525590000955	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
1.0	0.693784216972	I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded.
0.0	0.0897191724086	Let me...
0.0	0.424566363706	You can go to opensecrets.org and check that.
0.0	0.478713435538	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.528500953009	She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.0662619758225	I think he is right.
0.0	0.752956271051	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.0352400280991	Good evening.
0.0	0.243619058432	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.453320985967	Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.
0.0	0.196465838631	But...
0.0	0.139000773594	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.178048011415	And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.
0.0	0.00900595845996	They're great.
0.0	0.239895267886	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
0.0	0.0105824380708	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.400072281295	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.196465838631	We have to do it.
0.0	0.0585467923644	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.266921231991	We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
0.0	0.041585915261	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.9542237866	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.433213167617	Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
0.0	0.467784057804	That's the wrong number.
0.0	0.0734003157373	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.123102997913	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.0974293010666	There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.
1.0	0.836170832801	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.0285420249933	...the only reason is -- look...
0.0	0.376217376984	So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act.
0.0	0.18362176875	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.011820932788	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.303805815358	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.0160507889565	It can happen.
0.0	0.649502674913	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.0474472022679	I have no idea.
0.0	0.177966180746	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.142928124115	Let me just say this...
0.0	0.100516123693	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.274313044288	This nation is the most powerful military in the world.
0.0	0.882667397525	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.226827212136	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.231421266212	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.177385145826	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.222619339595	... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.
0.0	0.199664978362	He believes everything he stands for.
0.0	0.327947794342	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.234186115694	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.00457094503752	What sense is that?
0.0	0.259424679488	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.296774369364	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.248554877434	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
0.0	0.0217308428563	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.148056436869	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.359195908632	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.0772593207093	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.0600550837885	We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
0.0	0.0914194692318	Mark my words.
0.0	0.451366262351	But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.
0.0	0.571367258266	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.36669878295	Yes.
0.0	0.304993137056	Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.
0.0	0.139618013391	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.264762478206	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.286057302684	And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
0.0	0.303701773803	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.321630550886	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.
0.0	0.273647458384	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.317874388296	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.553224648838	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.472917005492	In fact, if you remember, 50, 60 years ago, the University of California, City University of New York were virtually tuition-free.
0.0	0.102313901221	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.179912878284	That will change everything.
0.0	0.262807754448	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.0641270248759	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.604718204614	When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.0991341566233	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.23299649906	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.516622740635	John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.
0.0	0.251959174948	Check it out.
0.0	0.192173480123	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.149711951523	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.
0.0	0.173361756989	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
1.0	0.276706093537	Well, John, look, I think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis to leave by 2011, is that an Iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend Iraq.
0.0	0.436856411809	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.118637259622	You want one?
0.0	0.251100527576	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.
0.0	0.0390207440324	I will...
0.0	0.327376498556	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.188321383089	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.373181638532	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.0530380919618	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.112265682073	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.94330223979	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.082082032969	We're running.
0.0	0.100905811653	If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen.
0.0	0.279114155995	It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
0.0	0.358846276481	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.3642023171	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.165959009656	I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path.
0.0	0.296224276206	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.46537539632	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.303759805621	But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.
0.0	0.00449019473597	You are not our adversary, you are our partner.
0.0	0.606377640382	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.964313171654	We defended the highest median income in the country.
0.0	0.225634820639	May I have a chance to respond to this issue?
0.0	0.896872765148	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.49409887954	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.185465300766	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.
0.0	0.0700244794418	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.0752275387259	That is not right.
0.0	0.163363361121	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.667029015677	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.362222739618	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.346036710328	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.570891418642	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.155928871314	The CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary.
0.0	0.303758644811	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.0594952999831	I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.334377743702	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.134953830042	What is the best way to do it?
0.0	0.154298076716	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.675922018389	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.0167506101142	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.107670425801	Let me just...
0.0	0.15057345543	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...
0.0	0.0508832775643	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
0.0	0.420902081638	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.0818775409273	We're rebuilding many countries.
0.0	0.178255220839	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.403164642062	I'm not using the lobbyists.
0.0	0.256509739149	I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.
0.0	0.491288319799	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.26833973039	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.221856977646	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.173186393321	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.449772264739	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
0.0	0.113129550411	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.0655489762461	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.0608072390819	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.344244729605	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.122163679475	Our country is in crisis.
0.0	0.0959924853052	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.205903083562	In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.
