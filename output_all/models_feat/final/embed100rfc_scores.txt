0.0	0.234167972599	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.265235512516	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.33970524397	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...
0.0	0.261797122811	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.

0.0	0.410137316362	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.420467857485	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.452577890479	We have one House member from Vermont, three candidates in the race.

0.0	0.102912919781	A brief response.
0.0	0.343842976109	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.478552670129	If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W.

0.0	0.102425413096	We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.
0.0	0.0548904012107	You're right.

0.0	0.165001348177	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.0308740374919	So, so important.
0.0	0.421996046507	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.234694920712	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.221126933371	Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen?
0.0	0.0710280416051	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.123829015517	Let me say on that...

0.0	0.226167547482	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.327764858536	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.400672848762	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.0514052136588	You know why?
0.0	0.369794591241	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.414088942003	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
1.0	0.121406266407	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.200779964862	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.346106714198	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.305371480206	They're going to take away thousands of jobs.
0.0	0.120249409262	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.131182007861	They blow people up.
0.0	0.0394026460868	Well, thank you.
0.0	0.16582746652	We saw what happened in Egypt.
0.0	0.469553945854	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.192567135742	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.13214255013	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.312066158343	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.224883324939	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
0.0	0.435984196064	... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.
0.0	0.208388991066	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.156781095182	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.203886481326	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...
0.0	0.347896822243	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.144520465291	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.0372462969267	It's true.
0.0	0.25392453171	We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.
0.0	0.129873094713	Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.
0.0	0.328358046477	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.205317838253	And they wanted to make sure it got built.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.363956441713	When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.
0.0	0.0485334428049	We can do that.
0.0	0.217165857556	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.24229365558	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.249122314429	They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.
0.0	0.253826785308	When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
0.0	0.104743521922	Believe me, folks.

0.0	0.318178656626	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.44544360787	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.
0.0	0.0781933981928	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.243721995441	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.197936601997	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.423567566566	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.0755393413239	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.478720861639	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
0.0	0.284834074487	That is some group of people.
0.0	0.289495380965	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.420985469059	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.43476274213	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.218396513788	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.267892505359	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.120706353299	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.374598964272	Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.
0.0	0.335526309782	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.258767838297	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.344967767386	Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face.
0.0	0.298719786715	They have children who are doing so well, I've met and worked with dreamers.
0.0	0.228031600783	Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
0.0	0.506355413383	My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.
0.0	0.19727160328	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.192605182554	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.120851174975	In all due respect...
0.0	0.0877902780451	I'm going to be independent.
0.0	0.331011762253	I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.

0.0	0.106004331134	My name was invoked.
0.0	0.214093806261	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.383133283854	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.38672012904	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.238324856683	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.400389611937	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.

0.0	0.370370331164	Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone.
0.0	0.109758546628	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.194544175902	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.

0.0	0.373126843353	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.257817478494	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.191436027905	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.00525691941951	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.435654017787	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.

0.0	0.0261087688153	We all understand that.

0.0	0.480774887144	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.

0.0	0.392440427544	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.145168759803	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.274576657906	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.380533721699	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.174055954596	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.710518003703	It is.
1.0	0.993999752382	And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money.
0.0	0.00778817644474	You don't have to.
0.0	0.321477211875	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.

0.0	0.491072236157	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.386419458749	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.

0.0	0.24503277646	It has too much economic power.
0.0	0.295886119726	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
0.0	0.521486222051	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.0202577584152	I agree with that.
0.0	0.419827195214	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.

0.0	0.291883817594	That can be done without profiling people.
0.0	0.264066547221	I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.
0.0	0.206054449738	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.459874793594	There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America.
0.0	0.0766400893052	It's coming from more than Mexico.
0.0	0.47917091536	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.217857386683	I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination.

0.0	0.0825235352723	Fine, I'll take it.
0.0	0.5	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
0.0	0.421949982436	And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.
0.0	0.421964366895	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.420262108097	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.
0.0	0.0304575845678	I will not do that.
0.0	0.529849243078	I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war.

0.0	0.332638871927	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.343339368641	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.198837361227	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.361574068942	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.179403721959	So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.
0.0	0.199464094327	We were the first in the family.
0.0	0.307936383163	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.365485830693	The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress.
0.0	0.048644785367	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.363874664403	It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military.
0.0	0.411744625982	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.284059843256	Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.195686875122	It cannot be contained, it must be defeated.
0.0	0.224922817808	We have a stock market that is so bloated.
0.0	0.348863839181	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.
0.0	0.14949855105	And, I will tell you, I love my life.
0.0	0.0220027945529	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.0467749761651	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.299057328195	Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country.
0.0	0.0572006673013	We don't want to be Sweden.
0.0	0.0522957031523	That is an egregious act.
0.0	0.182740653014	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.224644888702	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
0.0	0.165959652554	They don't even have a chance.
0.0	0.419709827398	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.175428531307	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.462932034754	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.355901434623	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.235158744444	We must keep America safe from this threat.
0.0	0.234717848194	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.270340493152	All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.
0.0	0.128432470372	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.5	It's one of 15 strategic goals I've set out to make our country a better place by cutting these sort of deaths in half in the next five years.
0.0	0.257492843608	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.0932950542768	We need more principle.
0.0	0.332990329941	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.204040125549	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.194993003006	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.402175222778	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.117060814529	Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted.
0.0	0.247830030936	When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.

0.0	0.297658021427	We raised the minimum wage.
0.0	0.420605763219	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
1.0	0.513131569204	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.192887191315	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.220849318823	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.211671580917	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.390398178625	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.513445506089	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.200463935998	I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it.
0.0	0.710518003703	...
0.0	0.144116877198	And I believe he is absolutely right.
0.0	0.118196789895	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.184227981279	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.127357993707	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.328763290487	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.119321192482	We can't even go there.
0.0	0.0272512586725	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.15644679921	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.232809897839	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.368158301578	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.0278802060297	And he'll say, "Please, please, please."
0.0	0.274559809098	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.361013789826	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.0660593323341	We will be there soon.
0.0	0.710518003703	No.
0.0	0.193136120644	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.214281073089	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.0800672942778	He didn't know.
0.0	0.132310211634	... and I'd like to respond.
0.0	0.348040209985	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.464435706649	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.410755246677	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.329987148136	We now have a gun on every table.
0.0	0.0776903994504	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.287058856027	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.710518003703	That's it.
0.0	0.0590432214489	The facts are are very, very simple.
0.0	0.168573994339	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.0858119235933	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.100208521028	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.248097303832	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.
0.0	0.14715271014	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.296660049025	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.112169728207	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.285445118169	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.309522378681	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.043689380883	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.31108596152	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.339777365636	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.11184629779	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.
0.0	0.039280157796	But get this.
0.0	0.352502399415	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.473705035661	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.1989021481	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.0878386446393	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.214541314778	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.578071799559	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.104897896618	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.0432761785232	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.115093209627	He couldn't answer the question.
1.0	0.968307558226	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.250454122955	I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.
0.0	0.0485334428049	We can do that.
0.0	0.282878016241	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.2822058716	And here's the problem in this country right now.
0.0	0.196294159989	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.29768100822	this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.
0.0	0.5	I've spent my entire life, since I started as a young lawyer for the Children's Defense Fund, trying to figure out how we can even the odds for so many people in America, this great country of ours, who are behind, who don't have a chance.
0.0	0.102795958068	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.0789013616526	Did she do a great job?
0.0	0.252303015969	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.11856844464	And I think has had a big impact.
0.0	0.18682161672	Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.
0.0	0.382583882103	The Libyans turned out for one of the most successful, fairest elections that any Arab country has had.
0.0	0.269474223679	We need to do it now as a nation.
0.0	0.710518003703	No, no.
0.0	0.369827999277	Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.
0.0	0.201337489362	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.491320354945	Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally.
0.0	0.380377938231	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.0383420756575	The problem is...
0.0	0.161697632532	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.256538999635	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.00886843673234	I was the architect.
0.0	0.377745354407	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.321657599136	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
0.0	0.120736250173	Listen, we can solve immigration.
0.0	0.221231794464	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.136082652361	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.18627947464	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.311428479217	The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world.
0.0	0.0649926235019	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.492437490378	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.152509217836	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.187498185917	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.43287659119	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.389083516683	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"

0.0	0.3949737314	I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.

0.0	0.22813772926	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.444856424136	That's what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I'm proud that they're supporting my campaign.

0.0	0.422959356411	Our staff found information on our computers from the Clinton campaign.
0.0	0.215266052359	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.

0.0	0.275508729719	I will find -- within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy.

1.0	0.971218750628	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.710518003703	And here's why.
0.0	0.359895491499	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.178079924466	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.210937353148	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.362653785334	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.553515309322	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.45388183065	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.474440149118	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.374876839954	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.0939084777366	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.144468531898	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.710518003703	What do we do?
0.0	0.350628835906	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.350690330294	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.0304952891555	Looking forward to it.
0.0	0.344876671651	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.458199965767	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.267982187495	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.0315199295042	I (inaudible).
0.0	0.245519555192	And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.322887349586	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.0662072531164	That's what the political revolution is about.
0.0	0.425309775946	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.363984447583	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.18856999859	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.334468603827	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.190208979777	I never said that.
0.0	0.272319101178	The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.
0.0	0.0949690523483	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.174721548056	Now, what does that mean?
0.0	0.469700461935	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.441899673223	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?
0.0	0.376036063451	In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.
0.0	0.271445638799	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.369674905088	We have to end -- education has to be local.
0.0	0.455885409744	As Americans, we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet, but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies, to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability.
0.0	0.322221676287	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.0514052136588	But you know what?
0.0	0.233515662186	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.12235159572	It really is important that we go forward on this.
0.0	0.388931307165	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.27808073265	First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, "they cannot have it all."
0.0	0.351246381545	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.
0.0	0.250609573939	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.400521566276	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.153131852797	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.180593265509	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
0.0	0.193869895341	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.288365592529	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.150965450885	I say, "That's a terrible story.
0.0	0.384335378352	The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.
0.0	0.441674797669	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.213569143886	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.144347992154	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.390797298022	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.263265791511	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.249166499315	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.362979770529	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.34694056088	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.082088697822	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.441674797669	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.20072314486	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.408494137643	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.
0.0	0.156387813122	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.00738149662755	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.0564711643196	I like it.
0.0	0.157042377051	First of all...
0.0	0.190712491147	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.538245608265	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.5	And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.
0.0	0.081571310595	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.306852007081	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.0791444539145	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.257017141136	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.471158531615	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.296475474311	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.388585341664	It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested.
0.0	0.279509683409	They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.
0.0	0.437701933117	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.195146045766	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.275236890959	... and say there is something more important than money.
0.0	0.266727679009	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
1.0	0.385012065666	And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent.
0.0	0.137583752855	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.138393634184	That would be a disaster for this country.
0.0	0.303545690744	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.0578131723856	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.265393622614	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.432324879568	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
0.0	0.160116103778	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.352354751572	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.
1.0	0.986466981266	I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance.
0.0	0.432922710076	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.5	I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.
0.0	0.200678318216	Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire.
0.0	0.0736283804014	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.234557345224	We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States.
0.0	0.299443030263	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.289322789773	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.210873577193	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.224107964844	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.339727023169	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.
0.0	0.0251268278662	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.344142979505	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.0124405654189	I can't do it.
0.0	0.222067386202	It will be a way of life.
1.0	0.311800879148	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.192878153558	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.234207201223	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.159699592432	We should be supportive of that effort.
0.0	0.0938559188032	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.206280696285	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.26661385795	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.187826356578	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.333763640161	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.333017714454	My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves.
0.0	0.241243823921	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.289496051266	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.136794653165	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.474492573925	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.381254743664	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.0562659026404	Go to YouTube.
0.0	0.0179029762266	Yeah.
0.0	0.259278509359	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.122491080968	And second of all...
0.0	0.132030768892	We don't eliminate Medicare.
0.0	0.545708987531	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.110628657001	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.
0.0	0.386949850138	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.186084190272	I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.
0.0	0.332902883345	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.254085962724	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
0.0	0.396894539526	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.281142140996	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.312753293657	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.
0.0	0.27828552643	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
0.0	0.174892272339	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.125700487348	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.385761142274	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.149909243164	I think we're at war with jihadists who have --
0.0	0.340470121434	But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding.
0.0	0.330699439901	Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.124929866969	So I've watched the politicians.
1.0	0.976037924728	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.

0.0	0.204493886125	How the hell can you vote for this guy?
0.0	0.0383664724137	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.383266672256	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.34081678532	Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.
0.0	0.328488695843	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.205256478178	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.29836880801	I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen.
0.0	0.129695968741	Of course not.
0.0	0.31040136027	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
1.0	0.992008816444	We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.
0.0	0.412952671229	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.281505790015	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.443712849657	Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care.
0.0	0.297613336977	You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question.
0.0	0.130895884658	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.19522061785	People who we should be welcoming and working with.
0.0	0.710518003703	So did you.
0.0	0.244599139943	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.212293577452	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.127442505767	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.710518003703	...
0.0	0.5	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.0259941703719	No, Martha, I would not.
0.0	0.0985758003723	There's a lot packed into that statement.
0.0	0.0949980670723	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.5	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
0.0	0.340433828706	And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country.
0.0	0.595545215745	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.0822736263545	They're a great family.
0.0	0.328888756986	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.0941732832769	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.464805288747	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.282452659464	Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
0.0	0.0726811609504	It's making...
0.0	0.208895706724	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.255242364825	Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.
0.0	0.388632430848	It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.
0.0	0.288398189045	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.323177063502	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.140973385848	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.301187442033	Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.
0.0	0.0348852307884	Everybody should.
1.0	0.987679917138	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.411730623584	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.18056984182	Because we need money.
0.0	0.2837453918	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.3283853277	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.141695494289	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.239770175196	If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.
0.0	0.475582051081	But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
0.0	0.0876589989575	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.00402035179864	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.316850148983	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.437386020046	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.176706389684	What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.
0.0	0.227944215314	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.0931616529497	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.0472352564945	We got it.
1.0	0.970813333841	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.198814593842	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.26691779088	And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation.
1.0	0.991915597374	So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education.
0.0	0.169564421749	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.0959625654915	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.199099994138	There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better.
0.0	0.0568841025006	Sure.
0.0	0.710518003703	But Megyn...
0.0	0.0753498383546	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.226584842922	And we need the right people.
0.0	0.246342997844	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.337174734825	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.0697643407409	And who's compromised and who is principled.
0.0	0.283162436859	Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
0.0	0.710518003703	No.
0.0	0.208713046346	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.370644891607	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.358991461791	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.359756409427	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.0565505809307	It is not tough talk.
0.0	0.186777651791	But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college.
1.0	0.45685413257	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.363488615092	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.412562997446	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.386196018478	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.
0.0	0.396818512424	Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago.
0.0	0.217529020413	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.373645161859	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.
0.0	0.230757136483	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.403374791781	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.370332253516	Social Security, which Republicans call a Ponzi scheme, may face privatization.
0.0	0.14267842131	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.360652204213	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.710518003703	Again...
0.0	0.338262904985	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.00486140965158	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.435783780649	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.00130478216833	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.0352944616132	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.104377256582	It's their money.
0.0	0.310134234382	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.443001268406	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.310072689717	Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title.
0.0	0.135150273965	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.239706606907	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.382245999307	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.387957103061	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.148491418562	He hit oil.
0.0	0.0739672277869	Yes.
0.0	0.29250156025	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.044603128433	They're a scam.
0.0	0.0616201575098	It feels different.
0.0	0.308616205924	Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare?
0.0	0.247717368385	My mother's dream -- and she died very young, but my mother's dream for her whole life was to be able to get out of that rent-controlled apartment and own a home of her own.
0.0	0.343797033636	Making sure that Muslim Americans don't feel left out or marginalized at the very moment when we need their help.
0.0	0.5	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.091784613043	And they're all over the place.
0.0	0.0317285179932	Not good.
0.0	0.424070429533	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.387409330626	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.
0.0	0.358181814007	But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.
0.0	0.395824215645	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.217382435281	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.335316821793	Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild.
0.0	0.215836345746	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.104498691483	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
1.0	0.981888885716	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.393563385944	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.435923919574	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.307218124199	Many are in this building.
0.0	0.436147200204	Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.
0.0	0.106486717139	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.44041885592	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.236599190075	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.391426103948	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.193502199936	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
0.0	0.45122523196	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.0438975974673	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.17947047031	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.0727555691483	Now I'm not doing that...I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?
0.0	0.297429546067	We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.
0.0	0.0411297956416	Think about that.
0.0	0.341576536534	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.542241728225	We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.
0.0	0.161898514828	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
0.0	0.308206720351	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.180208185823	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.481039076696	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
1.0	0.992505045176	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.18792913486	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.420792421243	You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.
0.0	0.303924753266	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.164497539314	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.278068106387	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.0612645803775	But Obamacare kicks in in 2016.
0.0	0.235367304206	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.379285159508	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.566362951794	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.00388298097135	...Chris...
0.0	0.338789806705	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.203420314101	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
1.0	0.987142328636	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
1.0	0.352552875013	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.0216933073923	That's not fair.
0.0	0.237233630509	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.403791704445	We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.
0.0	0.0370078266471	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.446977137065	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.0858119235933	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.00465641271308	We did our own rallies.
0.0	0.0364360761967	Okay, thank you.
0.0	0.0872557145789	And we should be a welcoming nation.
0.0	0.710518003703	We do.
0.0	0.351618844742	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.373429628326	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
1.0	0.562672837042	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.341877875638	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.217900433006	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.260457187668	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.125173773929	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.373272358287	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.16568604842	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.0388617734133	We were wrong.
0.0	0.291532368464	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.37772747424	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.309390648583	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.276010334496	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.467591228435	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.152533581931	Nothing's gonna get done.
0.0	0.369190300109	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.710518003703	No.
0.0	0.0514052136588	And you know what?
0.0	0.5	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.312338408435	The DNC has hired vendors.
0.0	0.103151039995	I've gotten to do some incredible things.
0.0	0.375501370913	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.46007507276	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.406171600658	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.445121968344	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.30528284636	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.181118293447	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
0.0	0.159694647326	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.0471079347342	As a Catholic, that's what I want to do.
0.0	0.308023512403	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.274383806611	Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.
0.0	0.230624318725	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.24644845222	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.423051882967	When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it.
0.0	0.39192954031	The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.
1.0	0.988408488311	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.248194001274	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.210935407763	I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here...
0.0	0.310274551678	I -- I believe that we should make community college free.
0.0	0.010898296736	It's a joke.
0.0	0.224900742387	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.232065066385	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.371165378225	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.

0.0	0.155511409249	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.223247966182	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.391132499904	It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them.
0.0	0.225801620641	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.150901890237	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.206451482349	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.329704491423	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.186298516301	I was there in '89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.
0.0	0.0383420756575	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.303025443089	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
0.0	0.0383420756575	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.262304440957	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.511949995064	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.224745005517	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.559607553799	But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.
0.0	0.0105755643901	But I was born here.
0.0	0.400947633613	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
0.0	0.286089224048	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.342551141179	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.312515965893	(APPLAUSE) They're trying to prevent people from registering to vote.
0.0	0.146835280095	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.18616860127	I said, "They send it back?"
0.0	0.0772380409975	He got lucky with fracking.
1.0	0.446964803128	Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof.
0.0	0.2860258467	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.211431787263	I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena.
0.0	0.296567304717	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.132690332616	That's the secondary issue.
0.0	0.177664809276	You have a problem with ISIS.
0.0	0.301929781449	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.
0.0	0.240398656646	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.0280557633747	OK?
0.0	0.376592642227	In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston.
0.0	0.377503391628	And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.
1.0	0.991152601601	Very few children.
0.0	0.0296983779307	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.369827773489	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.0242962005723	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.333790858111	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.254952563598	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.345264515598	And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending.
0.0	0.421348375424	You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?
0.0	0.263792589087	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.0645634447389	Oh, great.
0.0	0.710518003703	She did.
0.0	0.0187209621408	How great is that?
0.0	0.103857937472	I hope those are the issues we'll discuss.
0.0	0.117280791122	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.109263446875	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.217021761299	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.400586934962	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.189937509895	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.358365698435	Well, you know, governor, I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010.
0.0	0.373280854932	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.267292337808	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
1.0	0.0622769494705	It was below zero.
0.0	0.29740337139	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.316242346293	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.285184005726	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.288616780544	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.161067647278	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.235002027486	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.
0.0	0.357490388801	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.434071582464	It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control.
0.0	0.375335557488	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
0.0	0.454453630342	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.0187209621408	He does great.
0.0	0.37628740319	So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out.
0.0	0.050627223154	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.126229080479	Barack Obama wants to change America.
0.0	0.153002788727	... (inaudible) opening statement.
0.0	0.290179757036	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.17870463847	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.337556509412	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
0.0	0.172781871863	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.458566731163	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.16819171115	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.296533947671	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.133808355908	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.152853103144	I'm not using donors.
1.0	0.994323833235	Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education.
0.0	0.121091710623	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.299654898332	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.388787343994	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.470663534469	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.0483500895279	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.279048509757	I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace.
0.0	0.363914750083	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.375818273713	And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.234914056126	And your point is absolutely well taken.
0.0	0.434037691523	When you ran in 2000, you said that we needed federal robust regulations.
0.0	0.123189605916	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.0953045193546	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.157290449223	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.219737834444	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
1.0	0.982359635495	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
1.0	0.408542825925	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.0787383229331	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.319950724853	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.273114698191	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.24098635167	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.316255834126	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.20591301161	We both made the identical promises.
0.0	0.0917406574937	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
0.0	0.0825912752079	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.456333184739	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.480949519663	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
0.0	0.291746080216	Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS.
1.0	0.95870920497	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.175299711972	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.291695167332	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.0664324077232	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.18597853501	They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).
0.0	0.271805191583	And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.222585230406	We now finally are where we need to be.
0.0	0.316297316757	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.440317426774	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.362426413372	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
1.0	0.994435298225	I lost that election by three percentage points.
0.0	0.238451918459	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.0261365672145	We have no borders.
0.0	0.374027181637	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.226911644808	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.230558868963	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.19325618269	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.17219355023	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.198715769029	And it's just not going to work.
0.0	0.300920864115	I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security.
0.0	0.240336402087	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.157059315571	This is revolutionary for education in America.
0.0	0.26510630714	And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?
0.0	0.345080551355	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.46112303731	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.136337836985	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.352432478351	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.289142798393	Like, I'm standing here, I -- I watched the video of Senator Cruz.
0.0	0.0792099443521	What a brilliant idea that would be.
0.0	0.237576239819	Because I've seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime.
0.0	0.272239887321	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.0179029762266	Yeah.
0.0	0.293702044432	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.0514052136588	So you know what?
0.0	0.382222730928	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.386531791092	But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
0.0	0.387816629434	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.170165287357	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.389077574104	Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
0.0	0.27406060853	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.403377868362	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.00778817644474	No, they shouldn't.
0.0	0.00627375413038	It's not crass.
0.0	0.341729266021	Bill after coming home from Japan, flying 33 missions.
0.0	0.710518003703	This is 2016.
1.0	0.0801085273912	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.0705756184605	But not for us.
0.0	0.43146607516	So I believe that over the next few years, not tomorrow, but over the next few years, we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.0616110866692	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.166570756325	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.14715102821	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.245235197056	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.356390369008	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.256000767195	And people are saying, "What's going on?
0.0	0.364000472948	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
1.0	0.99610206078	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.438635052121	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.0237406431118	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.119402121997	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.339265910805	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.088389507145	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.160029466383	They serve in the military.
0.0	0.0326998183188	You're welcome.
0.0	0.393921194579	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.302199230681	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.404818025277	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.131561728999	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.214186022603	And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't."
0.0	0.104417253671	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.282174161126	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.441206029658	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
0.0	0.0863411380298	We need that thinking.
0.0	0.0476282434992	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.0848142235781	There are no simple solutions.
0.0	0.0285436042397	You do legislation.
0.0	0.394711207142	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.

0.0	0.361988437893	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.430468212244	So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.

0.0	0.13557014371	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.564948251593	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.106391833041	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.173068955813	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.5	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.349028153399	What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy, and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need.
0.0	0.456868940475	Tear down the EPA's blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates.
0.0	0.37850450283	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.34641321456	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.101590243188	I'll say this.
0.0	0.0625416093186	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.203119093285	My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.
0.0	0.239969189332	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.

0.0	0.2510722629	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.383786725808	But those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort.
0.0	0.129123863931	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
1.0	0.420467540667	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.354146613067	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.23962132945	As governor, we continued to work together.
0.0	0.311552277911	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.167772814674	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.30472912872	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.255956638939	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
0.0	0.199035533419	So, your original question is the right question.
0.0	0.155853223002	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.146376393668	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.0331104310084	... What was your question...
0.0	0.380377938231	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.0491226945938	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.446202224991	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.00973475328142	Dynamically.
0.0	0.5	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.

0.0	0.109347753821	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.0301845017075	It sounds crass.
0.0	0.5	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.149843602972	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.0373062507381	But I would add this.
0.0	0.2068942521	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.053475219904	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.330935018315	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.491320706858	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.456669842845	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
0.0	0.314758886105	Number one...
0.0	0.393641089534	And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.369024487967	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...
0.0	0.487875972499	$5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.354802919166	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.0716862853686	They were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.494577971311	In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, "what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"
1.0	0.439992483421	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.198269546894	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.133567287775	You just want to...
0.0	0.527820166977	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.5	Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.
0.0	0.321503125396	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.507505867744	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.136244055885	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.31629397117	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
0.0	0.101006934072	How stupid are our leaders?
0.0	0.388565863503	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.0931869795707	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.426609233281	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.15557072507	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.0892493991608	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.0961329204535	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.167561529343	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.
0.0	0.12518695078	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.25531655388	That's because we've put conservative policies in place.
0.0	0.178821943536	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.0308960149412	She voted for it.
0.0	0.357667608252	I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.
1.0	0.161012123965	The 500,000 who came home with PTSD, and traumatic brain injury.
0.0	0.441060253286	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
1.0	0.984590915395	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.161974129353	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.341216598542	The administration originally said 10.
0.0	0.278889212876	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.144209034646	He is a good man.
0.0	0.0187209621408	Great.
0.0	0.159470979085	But -- but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages.
0.0	0.199768259115	I don't think a halt is necessary.
0.0	0.212026428846	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.405174666137	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.222388022169	I mean, my dad went to college on a G.I.
0.0	0.17387164043	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
1.0	0.992123921473	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.425025519612	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.137390645986	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.0495548757372	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.423297527709	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.18794639602	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.206139297587	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
0.0	0.0383420756575	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.315734151942	As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.
0.0	0.30583212657	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.0479854868635	If I am elected president...
0.0	0.098690877667	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.419744883287	They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.
0.0	0.0564711643196	I like them.
0.0	0.300179557115	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.408288193717	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
1.0	0.364618560838	7 percent and 8 percent to go to college?
0.0	0.230184071424	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.0739672277869	Yes.
0.0	0.115922732241	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.515139480367	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
0.0	0.546085156472	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.425655262014	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.0742208198428	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.451342415648	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.318254889078	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.279646288594	You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that.
0.0	0.0806940460339	... but wait a minute...
0.0	0.578878070212	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.333694781703	They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America.
0.0	0.364713042011	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.123955888927	You have a bigger problem with China.
0.0	0.328993902056	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.255208996402	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.346164763462	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
1.0	0.473492860246	I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer.
0.0	0.451196467714	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.266224895731	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.139588954612	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.185601702133	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.40340845899	And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.
0.0	0.177180786593	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.0418883456235	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.45243690373	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.416601526254	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.
0.0	0.174332910601	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.235833300166	They are anxious on a number of levels.
0.0	0.371662358231	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.273691908978	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.
1.0	0.989452564124	Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.16372491406	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.28198088224	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.
0.0	0.276802962022	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.437880589051	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.175213056757	That's not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.
0.0	0.52485231617	I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground.
0.0	0.338208442565	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.278926586178	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
1.0	0.54044612096	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.440822039742	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.176163537629	My son is not a pair of boots on the ground.
0.0	0.395465655048	So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.
0.0	0.126211250606	... Chris, keep it coming...
0.0	0.416900937566	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.
0.0	0.123829015517	Let me say this.
0.0	0.0449171624312	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.428591327773	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.126347133369	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.237869389065	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.364862570159	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.36509001619	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.
0.0	0.123872774912	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.266003006582	I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
0.0	0.341854222457	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.071452886265	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.405169906339	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.177353978285	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.462597174583	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.266760872207	If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
0.0	0.162209301521	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.328479139963	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.365448474775	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.274656013528	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
0.0	0.11484392048	I don't need the rhetoric.
0.0	0.20374210732	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.430887399836	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.310490730646	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
1.0	0.32166879566	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.4471825724	They make a billion dollars a day.
0.0	0.249124001811	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.089266116628	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
1.0	0.983978600336	They were wrong.
0.0	0.46243868973	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.357433557464	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.381395050208	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.182975759178	That means medical.
0.0	0.341371714593	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.5	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.130177448057	You see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, I'm an optimist
0.0	0.461160676196	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.
0.0	0.0651603001768	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.235527887893	Starting with our children and moving forward.
0.0	0.0121124261849	She did it for convenience.
0.0	0.0741153938237	May I respond?
0.0	0.158299932491	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.0192663610306	Thank you Chris...
0.0	0.202630331269	But also, I can't fake anger.
1.0	0.392686131086	In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.
0.0	0.392480142572	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
0.0	0.0584387081802	And that's what I will do as your president.
0.0	0.413587498364	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.138190132325	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.250606934338	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.00388298097135	...Chris...
0.0	0.521295108062	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.402922759063	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.129756512518	The bill would involve legalization.
0.0	0.447349940473	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.249388971852	But wait, I just want to say this Senator.
0.0	0.54693069081	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.255152678694	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.466789225706	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.0652014316703	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.174643386855	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.255485485869	They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe.
0.0	0.190549312126	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.354603549116	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.335549015043	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.23406801025	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.432737832128	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.0177426919924	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.40848653827	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.0568365902533	That's the job.
0.0	0.0383420756575	Megyn, that's the problem.
0.0	0.304330741984	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.0732449641078	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.0473069155613	That's what should be done.
1.0	0.994414898806	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.212395191304	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.710518003703	What should we do?
0.0	0.320195690676	We have three children, eight, five and one.
0.0	0.105130592297	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.187794088501	Yes, we must protect our borders.
0.0	0.193889396161	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
0.0	0.0553011387412	They have to be alert to problems.
0.0	0.295917503629	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.394182445137	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.491164639632	We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.
0.0	0.067274163093	Media notwithstanding.
0.0	0.148081996642	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.268265804376	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.309136646883	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.
0.0	0.181601281051	We actually did it.
0.0	0.32119086808	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.553891865945	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.442611172133	But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
0.0	0.45271223784	It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act.
0.0	0.0595028938407	They don't like that.
0.0	0.00778817644474	Don't do it."
0.0	0.45968529197	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.304460992815	I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history.
0.0	0.0405016314413	But they're not good.
1.0	0.989425915799	They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.
0.0	0.328488505972	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.152433892049	By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa.
0.0	0.293396291796	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.285024401051	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.342641821531	So it's unfair to say in total...
0.0	0.361295539599	It had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.320955854269	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.710518003703	...
0.0	0.266216740099	Last point.
0.0	0.0526572661619	I'm proud of my family.
0.0	0.231251950277	And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.
0.0	0.284342013362	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.
0.0	0.239937331753	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.112781889787	I have a problem with that, Martha.
0.0	0.0652616630468	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.270777436562	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.270332468085	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.0635110327034	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.090693006905	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.454763908539	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
1.0	0.994274825008	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.235465495593	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.275966992248	You know where their United States headquarters is located?
0.0	0.250716498766	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
1.0	0.991003567568	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
1.0	0.227097626272	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.37553494245	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.421396354806	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.50671798579	They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
0.0	0.239691883169	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.430081649653	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.159317606909	Our country has tremendous potential.
0.0	0.230766485373	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.215202819384	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.154681678243	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.066711115111	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.0231851619929	And there's a lot.
0.0	0.0705080973912	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.414152903581	RADDATZ: OK. Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, right here at Saint Anselm college, Neil Levesque.
0.0	0.2546650702	The no-fly zone, I would hope, would be also shared by Russia.
0.0	0.508848812074	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.421062537895	There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan.
0.0	0.46323090979	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.430016144444	And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.
0.0	0.246806905405	When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.
0.0	0.267976900769	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.308125307811	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.442872201838	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...
0.0	0.0668424234161	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.0741153938237	May I respond?
0.0	0.0386996630688	That's 13,000 miles.
1.0	0.235079922488	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.391205950418	The United States has, unfortunately, been victimized by terrorism going back decades.
0.0	0.197472611516	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.510569428676	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.22379696776	We need -- we need somebody -- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.
0.0	0.351544769543	I think that is the number one requirement.
0.0	0.135365620063	And look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that.
0.0	0.3735906998	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.353825636524	We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it.
0.0	0.311782839794	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.218865014501	I would just say that...
0.0	0.27938678092	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.411126690618	I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks.
0.0	0.333703823933	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
1.0	0.973265132209	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.235104995718	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.380680981406	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.268593653291	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.306287310221	I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
0.0	0.46815281898	If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
0.0	0.0836485626156	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.279529920863	And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.
0.0	0.433939894644	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.489353920562	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.142021025501	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.271439111568	Well, you've got to be on top of it right away.
0.0	0.3913322556	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.119474969487	We have made some good progress.
0.0	0.162315338915	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.393599979927	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.127106370511	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.291581609102	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.225692547178	We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
1.0	0.0395408939246	We passed it after 9/11.
0.0	0.0951203983826	This is a terribly complicated issue.
0.0	0.21221770072	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.0820183872852	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.0179029762266	Yeah.
0.0	0.0262834487777	Martha, thank you.
0.0	0.419918594798	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.37219302346	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.125166695477	They're terrified by the saber rattling.
0.0	0.471821417696	I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment.
0.0	0.383217582879	You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.
0.0	0.126049207297	I kind of miss Donald Trump.
0.0	0.00510202917815	): Secretary...
0.0	0.286763114058	But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said.
1.0	0.386555023504	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.492543323457	And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't.
0.0	0.27240034064	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.510463891011	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.394778107285	Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.
0.0	0.384121357532	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.
0.0	0.15958438894	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.281084229285	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.259038782896	We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
0.0	0.361338027258	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
0.0	0.136010097873	I think this is a very difficult issue.
0.0	0.265198318671	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.100730255248	I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
0.0	0.217647329092	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.0337103611458	They have no choice.
0.0	0.330320507527	As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election.
0.0	0.263262060345	And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.
0.0	0.238857012788	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.343102880925	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.
0.0	0.24662562824	But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it.
0.0	0.297171657623	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.474500528135	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.0141347454873	Look--
0.0	0.0921874836172	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.31373355449	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.349074618354	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.180898354983	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.
0.0	0.335996844424	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.305546464697	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.21855059675	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.416919168459	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.250748745399	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
0.0	0.363870973573	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.0927551572328	I think he'd be a great spirit."
0.0	0.387811249587	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0883439159043	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.43221196887	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.21331028608	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.384615846057	And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring.
0.0	0.279453919165	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.392208893065	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.145027501537	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.00719307967007	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.170543943632	They;re gone.
0.0	0.10904238478	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.292616661168	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.110319955848	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.568928891167	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.10250849448	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.390256026016	Drugs have taken far too many of our citizens.
0.0	0.534957517457	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.0284891907327	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.226142481833	I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.
0.0	0.223628455747	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.5	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
1.0	0.959197599145	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.0608467960765	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.33730052323	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.201987615043	The guns don't pull the trigger.
1.0	0.0571974966916	They're rapists.
0.0	0.231335416485	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.342509745198	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.175215944295	Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.407173753141	We have a corrupt campaign finance system dominated by Super PACs.
0.0	0.21667204651	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.416475775586	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.430329564844	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.453644365119	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.212443985703	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.408307220156	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.348206856519	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.318588568878	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.387832602697	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
1.0	0.984163116401	What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons.
0.0	0.51249912887	Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.
0.0	0.159042294861	They're killing us.
0.0	0.42954619278	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.0488345283375	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.374436588704	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.0983327699438	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
0.0	0.227385567022	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.364880662807	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.32830165579	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.209130481683	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.397493866745	Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.
0.0	0.155370797354	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.431625704481	I've employed -- I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
0.0	0.283478362463	You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future.
0.0	0.269219949188	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
1.0	0.992874701402	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
1.0	0.99318685151	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.248209933121	Find out what I said to Greenspan.
0.0	0.422326255308	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.209130481683	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.493505209536	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.257705499462	Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength.
0.0	0.249147703237	This country is changing.
0.0	0.548540799053	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.286960662472	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.354063838449	It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.
0.0	0.370418773991	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.292109737358	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.225709007419	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.109350216409	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.175049759698	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.

0.0	0.298859889228	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.338564050958	I hire people, they do a Web site.
0.0	0.25076207132	Because a lot of people said, "He'll never run.

0.0	0.198135863219	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.

0.0	0.00956322808589	About Medicare?

0.0	0.408511284774	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.159097604779	China is ripping us on trade.

0.0	0.357467833146	Seventy percent of our population lives bi-coastally).
0.0	0.0433040238657	I have to tell you.
0.0	0.453972481711	And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.
0.0	0.0124668461184	Excuse me.
0.0	0.266945810187	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.277079525925	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
0.0	0.0603891116205	We're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.418262224447	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.344821033558	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.459889687262	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.380979606037	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.397548850254	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.313850377622	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.179837730015	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.152689173805	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.248076758467	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.358948156991	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.0433040238657	I tell you that.
0.0	0.359801289523	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.104418661097	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.245761884677	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.513749995535	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.0411297956416	Think about it.
0.0	0.244880459489	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.386075342027	So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.
0.0	0.183310973458	It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.
0.0	0.0824748826661	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.34169804295	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.268488725468	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.232187163228	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.416188036998	Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it.
0.0	0.377978037219	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.40985497234	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.229550634503	So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
0.0	0.390649227887	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.
0.0	0.224993314307	But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go.
0.0	0.402384252638	I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that's what Iowans like to do.
0.0	0.5	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.
0.0	0.228284606128	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.198420831594	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.282353460328	I watched the video of Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.327516073924	A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this.
0.0	0.351542993509	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.394021675687	... we have the tools in federal law to do this now.
0.0	0.472723099119	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.406285415157	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.408514251658	We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that's what's keeping him contained.
0.0	0.389069147927	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.394187391562	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
1.0	0.00518263304461	They stole it.
0.0	0.382994657251	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.486534024295	Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS.
0.0	0.186425961796	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.35199014591	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.230560460652	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.41197745238	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.238834172402	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.0910873327612	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.390728927936	And those countries who are opposed to Islam, they are going to have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today.
0.0	0.126755624817	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.207929495933	So, yes, this has developed.
1.0	0.992317283239	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.283834597519	As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.162543388646	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.33726623892	And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition, including Russia, to help us destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.271717754519	And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
0.0	0.195787434152	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.318083630138	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.305011417104	Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens.
0.0	0.213393274229	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.0250907996166	What about hydroelectric power?
0.0	0.384658689194	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.00845900648227	...No, sir...
0.0	0.278537454982	I mean, let's talk about this arc of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about.
0.0	0.409707118468	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.137122922885	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.291129061149	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.131002721987	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.234087394942	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.
0.0	0.479548223586	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.275112916811	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.304907972513	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.0372462969267	That's true.
0.0	0.222078646188	We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.
0.0	0.290847803496	... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record.
0.0	0.287770664991	... and we will end the illegal immigration.
0.0	0.0739672277869	Yes.
0.0	0.301526022638	The business model of Wall Street is fraud.
0.0	0.137959805785	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.0887520158698	I'm really rich.
0.0	0.358216452121	You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?
0.0	0.322100213158	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.061973733281	That's right.
0.0	0.105060794926	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.238140175728	They come up to my office.
0.0	0.710518003703	...
0.0	0.250220824422	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.228082014981	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.281173058392	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.561384260202	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.314053618949	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.211115417047	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.248795399886	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.271501296879	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.0492408224317	It's not about Donald Trump.
0.0	0.144394749664	That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
0.0	0.387635990603	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.229829509971	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.284480037415	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.232312111002	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.0877392930909	It's great to be back.
0.0	0.302489489306	We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.
0.0	0.10087753648	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.280898581983	They're controlled fully -- they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
0.0	0.320303717719	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.167211349202	ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.
0.0	0.143662253373	It is going to be amazingly destructive.
0.0	0.170823807681	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.400953996305	But, of course, international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today.
0.0	0.399403037703	Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people.
0.0	0.00778817644474	I didn't.
0.0	0.296171212906	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.109943295629	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.473834091593	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.391526190251	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.297884140636	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.164514834603	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.
0.0	0.443840622613	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.207424624304	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.710518003703	But...
0.0	0.0647685651312	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.384417938233	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.23984171332	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.434303797187	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.0570492073837	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.0507131534568	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.357477817353	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.391430552546	You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
0.0	0.456583544069	We're spending $80 billion locking people up, disproportionately Latino and African American.
0.0	0.184389417073	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.100903437496	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.261152719433	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.061973733281	That's right.
0.0	0.266574539303	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.0151839333411	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.0568841025006	That's for sure.
0.0	0.0478417257335	... funding to them.
0.0	0.444139052657	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.286528302327	We need to end minimal sentencing.
0.0	0.00997663859856	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.273087568174	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.337750235613	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.425175996341	I think it's fair to say that Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America, but the issue is...
0.0	0.522551883466	And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.
0.0	0.319109100127	Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place.
0.0	0.285515844683	But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."
0.0	0.149036883068	We need much more than that.
0.0	0.0366683797719	They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
0.0	0.3306700989	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.410921109815	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.448740835957	They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of Syria and Iraq.
1.0	0.356696298552	When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.189893363841	Now I want to go back something.
0.0	0.294646273192	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.365573270503	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.0785160263255	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.236071465379	The troops on the ground should not be American troops.
0.0	0.21238215706	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.257692496006	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.0296260012811	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.518873561134	And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion."
0.0	0.367209704052	We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.
0.0	0.185702726821	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.220370328184	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.332968363563	... that's the -- that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration.
0.0	0.5	Number one, there are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.176538096466	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.0231831335315	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.29611975167	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
0.0	0.0514052136588	We know...
0.0	0.230601283599	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
1.0	0.565928564855	And I have assets -- big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected -- 9 billion 240 million dollars.
0.0	0.183883468583	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.545727118151	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.298964542022	They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.
0.0	0.371466434048	Like we have a -- we have a lot of work to do and we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do.
0.0	0.140249473882	They don't know how to bring it about.
0.0	0.109989118782	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.0266473754587	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.513551127389	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.442034461208	And when he moved on his own people, threatening a massacre, genocide, the Europeans and the Arabs, our allies and partners, did ask for American help and we provided it.
0.0	0.331126536398	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.448406820198	We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress, but it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us.
0.0	0.0514052136588	And you know what?
0.0	0.198849572775	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.513091777313	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.252203338605	We are already de-conflicting air space.
0.0	0.5	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.0772759609346	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.185772721782	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.319321565202	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.710518003703	You do.
0.0	0.0479590567533	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.107654475941	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.282615074328	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.130172505602	Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.227786867814	Well, I just want to quickly add...
0.0	0.165283402732	We are doing both at the same time.
0.0	0.196217374527	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.315646725384	David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave.
0.0	0.136278498459	Let me just -- let me just...
0.0	0.0594992507632	I think there is a consensus.
0.0	0.183079666082	The list goes on because the differences are so stark.
0.0	0.290752128529	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.130712583649	You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches.
0.0	0.390916839308	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
1.0	0.993329278134	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
0.0	0.0988823815936	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.350176244083	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.139501298064	Didn't just happen.
0.0	0.00388298097135	Chris...
0.0	0.359082482455	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.385493499043	And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump," and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns.
0.0	0.291080195138	You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.
0.0	0.0383420756575	No problem.
0.0	0.23155814032	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.172709948239	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
1.0	0.984169031363	And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.
0.0	0.426644077739	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.436311728216	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
1.0	0.993419087288	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.
0.0	0.440253444572	Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.
0.0	0.336076943946	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.061973733281	That's not right.
0.0	0.256812882845	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.341207664193	The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.
0.0	0.485753978946	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.387318065237	And if our middle class makes more money, they spend more money, and our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.278697733829	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.419281557834	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.362282606361	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.480708637606	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.0732059257623	We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists.
0.0	0.304670461889	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...
0.0	0.146483752001	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.186345871044	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.40653713419	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.429551678541	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
0.0	0.323159327312	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.185375382699	Somebody said, "Oh, that's crass."
0.0	0.244889058532	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.219176340321	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.447008269308	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.298602621023	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.219189476672	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.392745499309	I sell apartments for -- I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.
0.0	0.466784922677	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.
0.0	0.463058880873	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.0739672277869	Yes.
0.0	0.223091887071	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.356943766426	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.
0.0	0.10072860163	Marco, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.226911644808	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.0259941703719	And Martha...
0.0	0.280135258076	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.429002446887	Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.
0.0	0.471895197409	I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.
0.0	0.2702497157	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.300671851069	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.334331474987	Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.
0.0	0.0514052136588	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.412807132951	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.357004804161	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.14897048553	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.283053337591	Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris.
0.0	0.0739672277869	Yes.
0.0	0.282672998079	There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
1.0	0.362459871562	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.36922720191	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.136637062233	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.470370934036	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.
0.0	0.454082700461	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.344784085064	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.329074536648	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.233609929738	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.271285782065	You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet...
0.0	0.448631000254	Or a young woman who had been performing at President Obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member.
0.0	0.151029156767	What part is valid?
0.0	0.234147994051	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.273042387393	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.165151726634	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.170606247426	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.228371124782	I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom.

0.0	0.485255970307	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.261962790132	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.203325952472	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
1.0	0.56268730698	That billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers.
0.0	0.380463571627	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.440769785482	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.11329232132	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.0897958752424	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.159481414966	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
1.0	0.989856667609	In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship.
0.0	0.388885797358	It's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement.
0.0	0.100555054777	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.117260849347	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.452484999412	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.196666590554	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.468165312976	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.349899713512	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
1.0	0.362385091782	Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion.
0.0	0.453115165171	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.280235762868	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.240076464261	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.349323875207	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.280489951659	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.
0.0	0.299274901469	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.0753730024424	Yes, I apologize.
0.0	0.171620809506	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.
0.0	0.5	Now that Russia has joined us in the Security Council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago, now I think we can have those conversations.
0.0	0.252049549025	But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting.
0.0	0.310123704968	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.140518955811	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.182573696851	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.359889650713	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.0995587954333	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.184789379964	Gronkowski is still going strong.

0.0	0.0908032941791	I've faced it.
0.0	0.352759863777	Well, we're going to have to redo the way the prescription drug industry does business.
0.0	0.710518003703	So...
0.0	0.0559793559206	I don't want it.
0.0	0.362130579403	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.0548904012107	You're right.
0.0	0.710518003703	How?
0.0	0.37594358805	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.255969965052	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.125793690117	Can I -- can I -- I just...
0.0	0.291791056671	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0794251568456	Came out great.
0.0	0.486897285881	It was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up.
0.0	0.328355704036	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.200913069526	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.129847261859	... ground and air.
0.0	0.251578399129	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.445189997928	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.191722649733	And some, I assume, are good people.
0.0	0.344016891666	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.0304575845678	I will do that.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.0778316245945	Go ahead.
0.0	0.0280557633747	OK...
0.0	0.256731197905	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.45099357803	After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the -- the donors and by the lobbyists -- and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero -- I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford.
0.0	0.16629234481	Martha, may I -- Martha, may I...
0.0	0.31790305402	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.276632323279	We've got to build a coalition abroad.
0.0	0.214944793344	And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe.
0.0	0.23296486731	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.573419911587	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.0568387539667	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.323020961962	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.382043492191	So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.
0.0	0.710518003703	No.
0.0	0.417700906131	Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage.
0.0	0.360505434307	Saudi Arabia without us is gone.
0.0	0.0946848687461	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.268361822882	And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.
0.0	0.270857629836	Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.
0.0	0.312053967114	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.293875419841	I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
0.0	0.355704289119	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
1.0	0.419716114848	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.168786785167	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.514247423477	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.294804801738	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.328942816007	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
0.0	0.223805967337	We expand Medicare to all people.
0.0	0.0400254703637	Break them up.
1.0	0.352133759614	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.138894988281	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.176675216319	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.346981070375	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.413413055896	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.275771610372	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.214589421908	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
0.0	0.180982306107	You want to know why things don't get done in Washington?
0.0	0.139616060113	That's the future of banking in America.
0.0	0.0246611704106	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.252710410997	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.122596714741	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.180140517647	Well, I've got news for you, we can.
0.0	0.133942474048	A military island.
0.0	0.522090354177	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.343859507024	We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.
1.0	0.447602393045	Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees -- these are big vehicles -- were left behind for the enemy.
0.0	0.453647513323	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.221292773106	And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?
0.0	0.146546025015	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.344066796873	And, you know, I do think it's important to do exactly what Senator Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about, and that they talk to each of us about.
0.0	0.398613927029	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.0205556292496	Talk about what?
0.0	0.160834805272	Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.
0.0	0.421743847416	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.138305948965	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.19470088298	Ted can change his mind.
0.0	0.355372535155	Now, this takes, David, 18 months to 24 months, two years.
0.0	0.455093308093	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.305448255163	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.256072926479	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.395220027365	It means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana.
0.0	0.0916026752217	There will be a process.
0.0	0.0152732712695	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.346300896947	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.213762648616	They are going to have to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.156719185328	They all want me to support them.
0.0	0.482045829813	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.101482539778	Then I looked at Rubio.
0.0	0.208984473316	Come on now.
0.0	0.405927686806	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.115079322893	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.318849929472	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.370401204974	And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.
0.0	0.152969294716	She led that effort.
0.0	0.0099687570241	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.39972315386	And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.710518003703	No.
0.0	0.118598969456	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.25209908858	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.494159459426	Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs.
0.0	0.332776558877	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.5	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.120989945234	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.17003726081	I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.161484238978	He's in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.459555923537	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.116278620774	I do not support amnesty...
0.0	0.425674807272	The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.430354597357	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
1.0	0.335908370923	They just built a hotel in Syria.
0.0	0.302970417765	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.366544279952	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.384855565068	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.200784004436	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.240114015478	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.0332245298226	The answer is no.
0.0	0.129979090405	She wants to pursue the American dream.
0.0	0.710518003703	Megyn?
0.0	0.307851995511	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.141021330192	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.217555520379	The intelligence was by no means absolute.
0.0	0.148958184484	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.25786857545	And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.
0.0	0.145784610172	We need to figure this out together.
0.0	0.091508144796	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.409304103245	I guess the one I -- I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after Bin Laden.
0.0	0.440195595758	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.242436854993	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.413307719908	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.15399649971	There must be some way.
0.0	0.259843666021	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.391239206678	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.433945823517	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.408650106034	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.378885977474	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.710518003703	It was...
0.0	0.407916157384	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.462601566145	But accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000.
0.0	0.255137545855	My wife, Jane, has been -- way back when before I knew her, a foster parent.
0.0	0.382355923611	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.710518003703	No.
0.0	0.194593543701	They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it.
0.0	0.252397921786	I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...
0.0	0.286767967331	And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives.
0.0	0.214093806261	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.377789781966	But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.205152308748	Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done.
0.0	0.0638693166049	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.321531980757	If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country.
0.0	0.22690669748	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.307983275355	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.274273449014	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.169305198881	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.0152682736292	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.158077317347	She's the senator from New York.
0.0	0.264708039113	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.132437157747	They had a plan that was good.
0.0	0.278537171652	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.539008545038	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.0695249463397	That's not the America that I think we should be.
0.0	0.321915978178	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.277788225429	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.444712119354	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.149742859856	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.0210277275103	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.371223309487	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
0.0	0.296476420509	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.240288877146	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.400149070954	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.183803833521	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.430799425686	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.311415190452	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.0861799501581	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.301576929742	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.219168711564	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.489554958004	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.302633160573	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.220917152099	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.274947134739	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.131474097255	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.330444852811	But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here.
0.0	0.180123631035	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.278347555317	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.206946608951	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.457310143173	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.22629510971	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
1.0	0.996026133484	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
0.0	0.311035771649	But the United States is not the policeman of the world.
0.0	0.156611472634	We've been at this a couple of years.
0.0	0.398266903455	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.212831503599	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.192939629282	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.402400684311	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.244470834933	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
0.0	0.407973956626	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.710518003703	No.
0.0	0.137600446777	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.0456553957739	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.412023522542	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.164039076619	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.00933210220322	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.317533574863	No hour is too short, no dollar too small.
0.0	0.0783493746753	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.185586280508	And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.
0.0	0.16645869151	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.257515038076	... do I go -- let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.3541044172	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.0341441801501	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.0912900583521	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.411221493156	We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.253680070029	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.
0.0	0.5	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.0805286262617	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.343011959048	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.297670967807	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.363933065028	Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that's not good enough.
0.0	0.159087877199	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.128764493361	We offered a lot more.
0.0	0.0615887606097	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.18457440001	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
0.0	0.247500792239	That is our government today.
0.0	0.219480788844	People were shocked, Trump got it.
0.0	0.0248401830082	Absolutely.
0.0	0.123027440053	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.161690689399	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.117582268366	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.200373800142	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
0.0	0.384569322675	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.279533348315	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.468070997377	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.271068837194	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.
0.0	0.193413742884	Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."
1.0	0.242047087802	That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.
0.0	0.147184888731	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.598065415461	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.407095714819	Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.0828881353812	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.356422171676	This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along.
0.0	0.406452752029	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.178994462888	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.124547111414	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
1.0	0.475454597554	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.270521694489	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.0554157323325	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.710518003703	...
0.0	0.182269843447	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.245543379749	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.466462833398	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.265258833792	The people don't work for us.
0.0	0.381318643317	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.145861821793	We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.
0.0	0.152880606108	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.318000801586	Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country.
0.0	0.314924394169	And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
0.0	0.143028505362	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.346657122544	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.291053405359	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.37481091238	I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
0.0	0.549025056247	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.042221557715	I don't have to brag.
0.0	0.0122783875864	The mentally ill?
0.0	0.411759597517	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.710518003703	But...
0.0	0.442826713303	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.15207813472	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.110304657728	And they're wonderful people.
0.0	0.184276594629	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.164274723355	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.197306099356	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.392806405907	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.293980305971	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.132693369048	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.0591479710497	OK, good.
0.0	0.318964197132	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.36546032842	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.367408971411	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
1.0	0.988330270621	I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians.
0.0	0.105774549818	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.36531040233	... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region.
0.0	0.390457685032	You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.
0.0	0.0722599891455	All of these are very difficult issues.
0.0	0.352610298512	In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...
0.0	0.390993612671	I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done.
0.0	0.431649647203	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
1.0	0.979596107417	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.559465502283	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.169052665478	You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.
0.0	0.24904004409	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.102095836941	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.330760867921	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.355476520457	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.311145904045	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.119223202425	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.32799967844	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.0738237512656	If not, they can stay where they are.
0.0	0.341472773811	Many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed.
0.0	0.258480150388	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
0.0	0.376014936904	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.
0.0	0.15260212568	I would like to see it updated.
0.0	0.437704604685	I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.
0.0	0.710518003703	It was.
0.0	0.0620116973276	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.374176118459	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.113132133635	Hey, I have lobbyists.
0.0	0.321775179334	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.511645277633	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.230883525086	Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.
0.0	0.129695968741	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.369411038394	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.
0.0	0.260789043947	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.131128035083	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.216760120285	She is not qualified to be President of the United States.
0.0	0.127959189869	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.161601763119	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.411491907511	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.165256423981	They can't lead us.
0.0	0.125822598525	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.445370529321	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.361657807045	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.0437656685546	Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.
1.0	0.367671280553	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.192759792061	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.159170541389	So it was not against ISIS, it was against -- it was against Assad.
0.0	0.399510489541	Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.
0.0	0.162037384249	You can change your mind.
0.0	0.0248401830082	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.301872561604	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.394859655062	Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come...
0.0	0.184576939912	We have artificially low interest rates.
1.0	0.99604631163	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.166938999158	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.37951518109	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.151633943046	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.296095262192	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.111421005072	It didn't have the votes to pass.
0.0	0.447664535247	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.189345311474	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.448983878574	... saying, no middle class tax raises.
0.0	0.101327708993	Martha, if I may...
0.0	0.37724479825	And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow.
0.0	0.400583396309	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.210937353148	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.287682410524	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.155745107744	When do we beat Mexico at the border?
0.0	0.182056493783	That is a pledge that I'm making.
0.0	0.130461278146	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.259368904596	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.24202139416	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.439554124318	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
0.0	0.288788521045	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.0580843636291	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.5	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.0970196044218	I've always listened to you, Megyn.
0.0	0.291129664771	And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before.

0.0	0.294591909924	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.335600058543	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.

0.0	0.0538472386104	But here's what's going to happen:
0.0	0.0926690017238	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.00770865650084	So be very, very careful.
0.0	0.415270518315	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.29788475595	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.492726865507	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.333738242788	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.30862388164	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.406551681472	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.248208734049	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.0653181174895	It's not working.
0.0	0.392145464461	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.29100404956	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.132897924309	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
0.0	0.364098107617	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.289750742408	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.0489719752909	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.352921970809	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.061973733281	That's right.
0.0	0.307806463909	We will see what the American people are willing to support.
0.0	0.373656348355	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.49473849674	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.481682867052	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.373104613104	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.296561273654	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
1.0	0.547958892157	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.327761230836	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.335243219893	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.
0.0	0.289549206461	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.0295956143509	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.142535580369	Chris I was mentioned in that question.
1.0	0.987981235838	And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.
0.0	0.367226439371	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
0.0	0.226654456857	So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
0.0	0.0317900717796	I introduced...
0.0	0.267391615581	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.29718775046	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.342635937628	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.
0.0	0.3502974059	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.104735790672	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.123829015517	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.0753136404618	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.0884554098516	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.153259936599	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.424763376201	Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability.
0.0	0.394325546445	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.248065330195	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.28948110008	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.477992788248	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.303038919617	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.
0.0	0.0768339513605	And before I say it, I have to say this.
0.0	0.260688467641	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.308066518297	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.061859809862	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.334221041413	Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home.
0.0	0.420817726032	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.17478362421	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
0.0	0.543649267924	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.343482637493	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.0617059888508	This is absolutely absurd.
0.0	0.363158848001	... people all over this country -- not you, Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other.
0.0	0.304366139329	... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.458053474727	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.469356106548	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.361924930503	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.272264547951	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.136379243843	I need your help.
1.0	0.261752619678	And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph).
0.0	0.257257701122	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
0.0	0.509840991532	So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion.
0.0	0.154566868927	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.42783055505	What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS.
0.0	0.124617168033	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.313797634869	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.220714044327	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.105338977634	Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem.
0.0	0.0979688490086	It's hate action.
0.0	0.0516377109145	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.309993124991	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.300792045199	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.407641797392	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.279794836074	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.369297911717	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.197678625078	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.0954445370613	These are very, very real issues.
0.0	0.344807656461	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.0315199295042	(inaudible).
0.0	0.0948414597717	They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work.
0.0	0.364150140072	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.270797417377	And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it.
0.0	0.379172915292	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
0.0	0.379245403223	And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.
0.0	0.280470491001	I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party's nominee.
0.0	0.327927229861	In the last 30 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.358345306342	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.100233370031	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.313818036924	No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.
0.0	0.454042640878	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.453196835714	We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.
0.0	0.295917503629	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.426148369005	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.46948736957	There was a minimum wage at the state level, and some places went higher.
0.0	0.361381707678	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
0.0	0.282105420554	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.0936697902363	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.0171317391057	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.55124705823	And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.
0.0	0.408380936827	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.2423357474	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.08158340096	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.235270884333	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.301385585495	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.182417827023	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.173085589577	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.124617168033	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.294873217259	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.531399705771	Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day.
1.0	0.990925684108	When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.
0.0	0.30679784906	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.0821894314406	Chris, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.402622143098	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.183386533291	And I think that's the false choice...
0.0	0.173633157448	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.21834715707	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.360618127366	If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.
0.0	0.172453196456	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.0694366180467	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.163520917481	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.
0.0	0.158187243796	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
0.0	0.31149766147	I don't get any money from Wall Street.
0.0	0.126426659679	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.547858559072	And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.
0.0	0.306129179486	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.152845826733	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.223687800973	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.
0.0	0.334017016354	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.177103994448	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.366581640141	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.260290996897	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.364769782501	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.420908368353	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.164840751765	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.
0.0	0.192793969896	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.5	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.260292650033	It costs me $3.
0.0	0.46619959435	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.
1.0	0.999999268289	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.403438163743	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.365749210493	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.435745575942	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.387371951893	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.110630677688	That is why we need to make...
0.0	0.354419581252	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.253135813956	As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans.
0.0	0.385480257515	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.710518003703	And why?
0.0	0.401039979938	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.417863859045	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.167308161956	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.190208979777	I never said that.
0.0	0.33893503784	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.0917473910245	Let's keep going.
0.0	0.24229365558	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.239468456232	We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.
0.0	0.00930438872441	Whoa.
0.0	0.302524287929	In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance.
0.0	0.107540556449	I think it's a two-pronged issue.
0.0	0.204766357594	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.098689523039	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.112239947426	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.0424870135121	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.0921785448043	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.461394049011	You know, on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign, I was in Keene, and I was asked what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?
0.0	0.462593888333	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.435753425089	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.250293050856	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.26933178152	And it will have effects in the private market.
1.0	0.989102287272	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.0581156075581	You have to lead.
0.0	0.416967165466	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.249735736509	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.275838241137	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.3877251647	I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.
0.0	0.445195901711	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.208304737362	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.448769400808	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.190208979777	I never said that.
0.0	0.224692040062	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.109904308669	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.494385243778	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.298895680059	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.12958444739	But Secretary Clinton is wrong.
0.0	0.458160509263	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.00778817644474	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.36158824231	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.00778817644474	No, you weren't.
0.0	0.0300781077544	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
0.0	0.370473913516	The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
0.0	0.240111100832	We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.
0.0	0.274489679127	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.402348389329	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.187314422258	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.229648069373	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.306648448054	If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.
0.0	0.20646815472	And I used it to pay off my loans.
1.0	0.984863800176	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.141345679072	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.0858984907492	And it's an honor to have everybody here.
0.0	0.283663492618	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.183387709588	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.229148302599	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
1.0	0.386963490957	And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
0.0	0.321600402964	We got a U.N. Security council vote.
0.0	0.258552654936	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
0.0	0.283094162715	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.250764465849	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.201425447114	And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a -- that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.
0.0	0.0268588640894	I promise.
0.0	0.520149278561	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.425642135481	In the 1980s, it was in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Reagan's administration, and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel, and others were murdered.
0.0	0.0248401830082	Absolutely.
0.0	0.38612844869	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.217056022005	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.19906374656	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.170679588975	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
0.0	0.0744677880864	It is not because of the tax writeoff.
0.0	0.348737139246	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.352564300663	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.0471359949613	They don't have a clue.
0.0	0.276404414904	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.311412923864	And, yes, we are at war with those people.
0.0	0.249377349824	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.112604385051	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.0303630897535	Okay.
0.0	0.268677140188	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.361085342629	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.45633645093	We brought together legislation supported by the American Legion, the VFW, the DOD, Vietnam Vets, all of the veterans organizations, which was comprehensive.
0.0	0.429060156254	On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center.
0.0	0.151330889606	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.453489257367	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.299121413545	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.251686176726	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.446601853991	And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.
0.0	0.45112516693	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.227073081701	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.178805255979	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.091508144796	Bottom line.
1.0	0.982363345345	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
1.0	0.260780974431	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.564115443796	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.359520279882	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.
0.0	0.5140878535	When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish Glass-Stegall.
0.0	0.40984983836	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.373270119045	The United States must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.102647746015	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.0638373287244	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.413983256308	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.0308740374919	That is important.
0.0	0.284310570931	How can you get people to vote for you?"
0.0	0.420923001356	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.117266211233	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.165427056724	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.111797438721	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.379567160642	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.138262405925	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.401813210865	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.196142801608	I didn't know I had so much power.
0.0	0.129585786642	I like how you stand up.
0.0	0.106600515747	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.0959625654915	Let me respond...
0.0	0.151262161474	I would not want to go to that point.
0.0	0.179279685102	They've become rich.
0.0	0.105233446036	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
0.0	0.183836494335	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.192057101262	Well, this whole issue concerns me.
0.0	0.183336594746	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.125283600114	Now they're going militarily.
0.0	0.257464477758	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.463177960129	We haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.
0.0	0.237241874967	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.201653126666	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.0873625598791	Look, I served on...
0.0	0.485233672031	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.275623472517	And I understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary.
0.0	0.258919082766	Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values.
0.0	0.296548385752	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.113729945767	But people have to be alert.
0.0	0.290382516676	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.266126098777	Well, let's take it one at a time.
0.0	0.321372577998	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.0629832776456	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.0419427050952	That's the big leagues.
0.0	0.107169701581	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.018521416016	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.229019157807	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.533889754964	States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government.
0.0	0.200456822754	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.111336997998	We've got nothing.
0.0	0.311553090437	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.0595245661026	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.0909860359496	They do it to us, we don't it.
1.0	0.0151073575362	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.20783965064	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.235522096238	Well, there are so many, I don't know where to start.
0.0	0.511348740362	And remember the $5 billion Web site?
0.0	0.274246742038	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.430360575616	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.0777479221574	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.341078377216	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.
0.0	0.457920865252	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.138894988281	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.200407439165	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.
0.0	0.111490853027	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.0366609511031	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
1.0	0.936927621164	Today, we have 272.
0.0	0.175598183507	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.243853132644	So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.
0.0	0.0777846635334	You know, the situation is this.
0.0	0.244579201432	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.240421336324	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.248683930502	I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
0.0	0.186425961796	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.0280727763305	Bigger than that?
0.0	0.0623115452334	No, I don't think so.
0.0	0.15047309586	If they want to accept our values and our laws.
0.0	0.218579192947	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.189359389917	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.130797103025	They elected moderate leaders.
1.0	0.983436511694	In 1988, just to set the record straight governor, I ran for the U.S. House.
0.0	0.0382380047155	You bet they do.
0.0	0.475100219785	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.31938196491	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.300558583222	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.374288880238	People died, and only three people have been fired.
0.0	0.300060940914	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.163026432176	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.438013743416	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.0800672942778	He didn't know.
0.0	0.0353729312387	I think you're --
0.0	0.0554286471591	That's kind of a no-brainer.
0.0	0.415702448885	Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions?
0.0	0.526484260049	We didn't win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America.
0.0	0.212885925951	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.0761591481611	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.21309273116	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.190923496111	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.349774019899	I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.057135402062	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.0540799738461	Predominantly African-American and Hispanic.

0.0	0.422330348553	Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin.

0.0	0.0151040231025	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.250726666269	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.368127123935	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.25545569211	So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly.
0.0	0.323369289778	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.444168443531	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.332413110719	But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance.
0.0	0.108321618913	...income tax...

0.0	0.149095619085	Yes, exactly, exactly.
0.0	0.0388617734133	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.341387544521	We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.
0.0	0.217003923402	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.0694941811282	You just can't do it.
1.0	0.160436188421	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.421460618643	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.445730550709	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.187850616546	And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.
0.0	0.143547221135	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.3638847563	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.553906080847	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.228166753867	Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint.
0.0	0.0947352584054	Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country.
0.0	0.215413342908	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.330927660229	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.334748599291	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
1.0	0.467058670215	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.

0.0	0.349813804171	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.176392141623	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...

0.0	0.0315199295042	(inaudible).
0.0	0.487802857215	ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.
0.0	0.401925170474	I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out.
0.0	0.343430075359	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.077818618977	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.461299428959	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
1.0	0.972296005082	It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.
0.0	0.305571229662	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.238126223254	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.406207128224	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.542705210638	I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains.
0.0	0.158026066034	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.
0.0	0.297780112879	And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem.
0.0	0.166542198598	And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China.
0.0	0.311984493584	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.153046658524	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.403480235688	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.107521170061	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.200444523698	We need to move aggressively now.
0.0	0.0809171515649	They have infrastructure.

0.0	0.061973733281	That's not right.
0.0	0.493098463214	What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the Muslim nations in that region who are going to have to fight and defend their way of life.
0.0	0.229198415284	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.

0.0	0.241546396221	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.044603128433	They're a scam.

0.0	0.287641027609	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.178020743757	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.0879878596796	So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.
0.0	0.390911979319	So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.
0.0	0.128589693894	I don't think we're at war with Islam.
0.0	0.349653778325	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.

0.0	0.0731509341808	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.417775492432	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.000828402474294	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.323418592883	But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be looking for new sources of energy.

0.0	0.2697842247	Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves.
0.0	0.398294373578	I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out.

0.0	0.346863090514	I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.
0.0	0.344094100628	Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS.

0.0	0.0151275839024	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.0485334428049	I can do that.
0.0	0.39165570334	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.380670581854	In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill, "Well I assume Hillary has told you about this."

0.0	0.267571832103	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.380179894635	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.228868283222	I don't need anybody's money.

0.0	0.0248401830082	Absolutely.
0.0	0.25787538723	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.305881268458	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.459078986917	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.117724980781	Now, it's very interesting.
0.0	0.371485535546	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.

0.0	0.465631381073	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.

0.0	0.270444301091	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.288686495038	We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended.

0.0	0.275233782278	Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.0571069315106	And I'm confident we can do that.
0.0	0.321653347379	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.156961721537	But they can't get along.

0.0	0.0964348444391	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.281203669757	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.44316878821	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.306686309481	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0248401830082	Absolutely.

0.0	0.0514052136588	We know about the Belgians.
0.0	0.419566738244	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.0548826618034	He's an entertaining guy.
0.0	0.434477063866	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.204955743436	And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.
0.0	0.364637123936	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.35134885428	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.0898814622549	I think so, right.
0.0	0.52231499446	And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.
0.0	0.0935200893303	It's affordable for everybody.
0.0	0.474326371438	But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired.
0.0	0.299649884293	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.0582044717626	I am telling the truth.
0.0	0.26646220451	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.204243715135	But I would say this to you, Bret.
0.0	0.346560364562	This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.
0.0	0.249833938396	If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.

0.0	0.416633519831	I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.
0.0	0.103533167381	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.241054748666	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.249924187192	But, bottom line is this is the year 2015.
0.0	0.110550725443	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.194231541792	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.026082096292	That's the difference.
0.0	0.513057961972	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.23411312059	In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
0.0	0.0730676819145	Your question was you have disagreed...
0.0	0.357227397289	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.0514052136588	And you know what?
0.0	0.277406467685	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
0.0	0.0106010365496	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.0379937596794	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.385961079554	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.19520838049	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.215006929674	And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said.
0.0	0.424427205637	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.282871623223	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.0280557633747	OK.
0.0	0.534041177577	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.157310594508	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.0393768998984	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.253616308052	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.263068093475	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
0.0	0.216967134734	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
0.0	0.110659078662	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.442527691956	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.12713365535	Again, with all do respect to Secretary Clinton...
0.0	0.710518003703	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.425609368512	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.372162030133	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.374635823072	And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that.
0.0	0.361141682775	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.438435417913	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.370988983866	All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee.
0.0	0.0284030305697	That's my view.
0.0	0.20366158922	Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting...
0.0	0.252721407211	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.471704131882	As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.
0.0	0.159170541389	It is ISIS.
0.0	0.189875006004	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
0.0	0.271296687648	Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...
0.0	0.320372277028	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.207378136376	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.183837599533	So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.
0.0	0.266762597358	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.358005846071	ISIS, now, is the major priority.
0.0	0.380974723441	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.258018046315	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.061973733281	All right.
0.0	0.5	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.226911644808	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.0118339924634	So did you, Marco.
0.0	0.108803589189	And we have to stop all the divisions.
0.0	0.377439720144	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.23248196365	I'm meeting with three of them in the next week.
0.0	0.335901480546	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.449069487813	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.373260791196	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.101726995338	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.710518003703	But what...
0.0	0.391152323686	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
1.0	0.982952765571	This small country has welcomed in many refugees.
0.0	0.370994615465	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.0627857717861	We saw a dictator overthrown.
0.0	0.280112702798	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.41964748509	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.105006910871	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.486891974413	That is why I support a $12 national federal minimum wage.
0.0	0.0620116973276	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.205500551034	They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there.
0.0	0.230281310675	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.139834165808	He said, "I can't get it into China.
0.0	0.368849669567	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.0804859569178	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.0145139892697	It is a disaster.
0.0	0.2344842327	And Abdullah said something recently, very important.
0.0	0.230535091368	Please become part of the political revolution.
0.0	0.312950069332	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.15462266782	Nobody can do that like me.
0.0	0.218664703734	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.305030712913	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.410089507801	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.292271615913	At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida.
0.0	0.328470711504	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.515445440397	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.238145356651	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.308597708618	... First of all -- Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.245459841446	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.
0.0	0.463596445748	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.241807438931	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.266038062892	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.35215890742	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.114081004075	... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
0.0	0.349189958158	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.188857580006	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.364635355285	I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.
0.0	0.31032311222	It's campaign -- a corrupt campaign finance system.
0.0	0.312975571602	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.35269327904	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.100311487197	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.480743272431	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.127096404881	That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.
0.0	0.0928158940441	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.134538246363	I think that's a major accomplishment.
1.0	0.431759413323	And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
0.0	0.295936778087	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.380602406645	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.318404729562	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.223051567825	I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.
0.0	0.452084837796	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.101472915967	I was there and I saw the debate.
1.0	0.414011511386	John -- John, this country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.246357993267	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.525678644193	We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.
0.0	0.262227017904	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.467710628112	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.215942858578	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.461390764424	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.130752006157	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.384655383627	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.
0.0	0.463121576368	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.255270372225	So protect the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.429282863246	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.297414438582	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.0944765773051	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.272480930136	We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
0.0	0.201804049723	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.444414785716	It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English.
0.0	0.43837957739	But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.361768082004	Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.214648420637	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
0.0	0.280032265289	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.0634414344597	You're simply not.
0.0	0.375175755998	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.0533044866433	And I watch the speeches.
0.0	0.160159933705	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.355575687318	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.
0.0	0.359968647192	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.119842752235	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.102860815286	It never happens.
0.0	0.197713727906	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.130752993775	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.451016743746	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.528319751833	But at the end of the day, what you have right now are millions of Americans working two or three jobs because their wages that they are earning are just too low.
0.0	0.204048894674	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.275053400992	You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well.
0.0	0.279063260788	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.0538472386104	And here's what's going to happen.
0.0	0.482095310237	It wasn't the bill that I wanted, but yet it turned out to be one of the more significant pieces of veterans' legislation passed in recent history.
0.0	0.423085361665	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.343831948659	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.279602758514	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.265578886054	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.106991404643	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.424788640284	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.185276949861	And I do not believe it's a good idea now.
0.0	0.0624117118028	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.282126906313	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.36066101608	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.178741203439	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.390983414852	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
0.0	0.290355450185	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
1.0	0.29479354168	I think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street...
0.0	0.335049805184	All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.
0.0	0.205928212704	So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.
0.0	0.294895809411	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.0390893737595	You count on it.
0.0	0.171615424302	Their business model is greed and fraud.
0.0	0.104265226577	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.416370667978	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.471270766439	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
1.0	0.5	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.249241053949	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.163170576971	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.710518003703	How about this?
0.0	0.420825246378	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.0730083952574	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.248474053044	So the reporter said to me the other day, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person.
0.0	0.234726193133	Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense.
0.0	0.101910988187	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.279703894087	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.476094627148	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.
0.0	0.340523279761	There are many crises that come -- a water crisis in Toledo.
0.0	0.061973733281	Right.
0.0	0.108750858369	They are not our friend, believe me.
0.0	0.341171422273	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.370326896583	But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector.
0.0	0.104656418644	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.0650054319197	Am I supposed to dislike them?
0.0	0.124791918673	They're saying, "Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough."
0.0	0.173407598472	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.190263526344	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.0965793331031	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.316000779948	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.155601184009	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?
0.0	0.163220180689	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.369060839629	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.370955140518	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.416180627725	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.280125519641	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.32002045813	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.318785972704	Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them.
0.0	0.202224670742	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.168785391996	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.0739672277869	Yes.
0.0	0.370689964761	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.0145139892697	It's a disaster.
0.0	0.171799293185	I said, "I don't know."
0.0	0.383315776708	They want American troops back in the Middle East.
0.0	0.329702309854	I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.
0.0	0.473441129896	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.
0.0	0.278654487645	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.710518003703	No -- no...
0.0	0.464846781609	And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.
0.0	0.293188978217	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.38241444024	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.302478974994	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.0179029762266	Yeah.
0.0	0.448946554321	Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors.
0.0	0.249140932488	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.348855983288	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.353745553969	The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.
1.0	0.588249562652	Nancy, the blueprint in Maryland that we followed was yes, we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment.
0.0	0.0496707283245	... Chris, your questions that you...
0.0	0.355081849875	And all over New Hampshire, I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose.
0.0	0.710518003703	No, you did.
1.0	0.98414758066	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.314682108607	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.242924493834	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.414550955888	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.0415328877255	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.141656406547	And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.375875172772	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.260673497153	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.155079867991	Quite likely, for that reason.
0.0	0.0884436540792	But it's a lot safer.
0.0	0.210516689041	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
0.0	0.0388617734133	They were wrong.
0.0	0.44561841261	And for my part, I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has.
0.0	0.299592690755	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
0.0	0.166130089435	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.168254619763	It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state.
0.0	0.0132597731091	And that's what's happening.
1.0	0.981175172682	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.0280557633747	OK.
0.0	0.394900412426	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
0.0	0.39315815535	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.332924787171	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.153774589612	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.144111512937	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.361774353658	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.302096483723	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.14341399268	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.0140937316697	I won't be doing that.
0.0	0.18653962254	Hillary doesn't want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her.
0.0	0.228974479299	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.235754862018	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.0999362345613	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.0800672942778	Don't know that.
0.0	0.180397555869	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.0612607256133	We're dying.
0.0	0.085952360145	I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail.
0.0	0.294233402703	Number two, we had a really good plan.
0.0	0.309268340555	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.101243965861	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.388041137143	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.103377442802	It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee.
0.0	0.18227215924	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.
0.0	0.155036013905	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.310969907783	That is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.
0.0	0.386607148164	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.710518003703	Both.
0.0	0.310845897519	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.271718961424	I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.
0.0	0.411344297846	Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
0.0	0.406750464276	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.155477447942	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.0783868657146	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.0211510700296	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.344593738085	But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.
0.0	0.253693267597	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.142429571709	Kathie, this was not merely theory in Maryland.
0.0	0.230168735851	They beat us all the time.
0.0	0.20252234948	The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.
0.0	0.490964661475	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
0.0	0.188721228187	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.245411614496	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.054819307703	I'm running.
0.0	0.181468380883	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.0368299407103	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.211128160097	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.221947875708	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.112152650779	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.
0.0	0.300394223083	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.204865388739	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.518597750342	I want the Buffett Rule to be in effect, where millionaires have to pay 30 percent tax rates instead of 10 percent to nothing in some cases.
0.0	0.26205632474	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.0388235266612	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.5	I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border."
0.0	0.376196470741	I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures.
0.0	0.405792209828	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.115093209627	He couldn't answer the question.
0.0	0.151928842952	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.0785160263255	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.143301392744	I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie.
0.0	0.486032826569	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.384118287148	And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.
1.0	0.988108556232	Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?
0.0	0.553201877816	Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.
0.0	0.433609147212	Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product -- a sign of strength, right?
0.0	0.46729920567	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.344488245441	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.148975645903	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.415846845148	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.470476877788	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.327887520431	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.345444865501	So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe.
0.0	0.194047360197	He said, "You know, I make great product."
0.0	0.202546941825	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.332276840689	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.358034917724	Border security has always been a part of that debate.
0.0	0.145642786953	We hear a lot of good plans.
1.0	0.983260518488	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.135345919146	That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.
0.0	0.567924014271	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.270714112444	I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria.
0.0	0.392909610055	It's one of the key investments we need to make.
0.0	0.434520669526	And I have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run.
0.0	0.0388617734133	He's wrong.
0.0	0.421432868559	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.201775995181	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.30562685776	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.310953529291	And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq.
0.0	0.100364733033	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.332203467416	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.13247682652	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.165843032568	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.219465123869	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.051320027388	I am advocating...
0.0	0.493354181445	And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.
0.0	0.363602948528	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.482943235765	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.124053943055	We have people that don't have it.
0.0	0.280481699288	... family leave for a very long time...
0.0	0.209203703401	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.227025551785	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.272260970351	If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out.
0.0	0.205982952262	That means education.
0.0	0.388599768257	I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.
0.0	0.443092980747	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.410595222679	I've had had two town halls, one in Keene, one in Laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do.
0.0	0.46499315862	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.0422334679824	And guess what?
0.0	0.356764770328	I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.
0.0	0.633511671154	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.448801786577	But unlike either of these two fine people, I've actually balanced a budget every single year.
0.0	0.177850362038	I think we all support it.
0.0	0.379512346987	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.408785573326	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.193176594452	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.1099632863	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.423593315822	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.364289177825	And, I would not that there's a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that's the EPA's blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline.
0.0	0.130280182066	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
0.0	0.414093473037	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.316403996588	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.280680394024	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.0410191405906	I hate to hear it."
0.0	0.172159613409	Got to be on the floor of the Senate.
0.0	0.169632637926	I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.
0.0	0.361406299904	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
1.0	0.995696141272	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.433566949499	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.252083969076	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.523004827302	We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.
0.0	0.536215089568	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.0568841025006	Sure did.
0.0	0.710518003703	No.
0.0	0.293403948735	Major crisis and primary health care.
0.0	0.07182352088	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.0770934282505	Might I respond?
0.0	0.464171135001	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.
0.0	0.429711864577	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.370414274495	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.295059252465	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
0.0	0.0597708902483	No, I think they won't.
0.0	0.361039733268	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.417014468666	So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.
0.0	0.270782053381	And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college.
0.0	0.0964870768884	We don't know anything about that.
1.0	0.546085156472	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.428429240106	We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.
0.0	0.14138111898	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.125278353666	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.214896413297	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.176526362033	But look, we didn't know what was happening next.
0.0	0.294029862509	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.278688116852	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.339434508671	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
1.0	0.173363816995	They're bringing drugs.
0.0	0.221643915074	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.608007009171	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.351862125986	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.0870783993911	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.037342979885	Check it out.
1.0	0.983978600336	That's wrong.
0.0	0.167698813458	So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do.
0.0	0.344697659668	What our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as Americans.
0.0	0.0304575845678	But it will be...
0.0	0.290572513182	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.031301254213	This is the election...
0.0	0.429585501237	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.297883666275	I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.
0.0	0.263986165486	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.408132838731	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.434935324011	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.466638237018	I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.
0.0	0.170783510186	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.245708779684	The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.
0.0	0.0179029762266	Yeah.
0.0	0.186712601916	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
1.0	0.295649029481	And some of them are like third world countries.
0.0	0.118260797665	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.169844872275	I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.
0.0	0.424509274103	The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...
0.0	0.0433113868394	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.491276419726	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.308189627414	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.361931789374	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.0888758674005	So Hillary and I have a difference.
0.0	0.354034639744	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.0546615113373	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.172446883844	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.314828865991	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.

0.0	0.25056596882	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.0846805908763	We don't win.

0.0	0.425360680828	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.421936024416	I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States and literally around the world that there is a "clash of civilizations," that there is some kind of Western plot or even "war against Islam," which then I believe fans the flames of radicalization.

0.0	0.271987063234	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.489705681002	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.383427579499	So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.
0.0	0.434552512619	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.170053046386	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.0724832143472	I totally get that.

0.0	0.217257854816	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.

0.0	0.0106392132038	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.0267093623301	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.335607609438	The first vote hasn't been counted.

0.0	0.181339026485	There are hundreds of things like that.
0.0	0.30335404812	So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income.
0.0	0.161662136183	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.507901521828	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.260007083011	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.468293777934	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.0433276569894	We have nothing.
0.0	0.290073502868	But if you place good ones, you pocket it.

0.0	0.454042640878	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.124673124059	But you would index it -- you would index it to the median wage.

0.0	0.294970372059	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.488357909134	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.24203545301	This group needs to be confronted and defeated.
0.0	0.161643979484	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.

0.0	0.261698151302	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.404991503193	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.473083113671	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.0939421626983	This is a complicated issue.
0.0	0.21890985017	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.

0.0	0.239251961927	And I -- I thought, if I didn't jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this.
0.0	0.249850453145	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.1460764048	I know the bad ones.

0.0	0.119473532601	My background is different.
0.0	0.226880409637	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.440173574347	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.196409769687	People that know me, like me.

0.0	0.250269803358	Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate.
0.0	0.274276953705	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.710518003703	Do it.
0.0	0.453249427818	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.372588189481	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.0228008749987	We serve you.
0.0	0.230425681458	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.0564711643196	I like them.
0.0	0.335609738245	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.138017439325	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.710518003703	It is.
0.0	0.294628443574	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.488600393928	They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.
0.0	0.235922456306	The simple fact is, we all have a record.
0.0	0.343341514971	And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world.
0.0	0.230776014199	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.114729636367	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.067265518238	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.286016603601	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.0999567532205	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.318317920192	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.0780687762424	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.298270641583	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.0419674000034	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.287781571381	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.428065993097	But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.
0.0	0.361479174274	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.580104045626	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.362818026707	A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.
0.0	0.0461234827002	That's American citizenship.
0.0	0.243619182615	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.190037015985	I am not the candidate of Wall Street...
1.0	0.956415888723	The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.
0.0	0.454892086516	Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.
0.0	0.317922479296	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.421647775016	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.22945727307	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.159613881807	Get rid of the fraud.
0.0	0.0739672277869	Yes.
0.0	0.120504106629	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.53897820639	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.343896969133	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
0.0	0.212370937195	How are these people gonna lead us?
0.0	0.0870150984205	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.228451337272	You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.
0.0	0.251595912598	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.103711276628	I learned so much.
0.0	0.294592817156	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.209543356177	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.387553585331	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.235438110058	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.061973733281	Right.
0.0	0.319537303276	I do agree that in particular, Turkey and the Gulf nations have got to make up their minds.
0.0	0.16600278316	He cut and run.
0.0	0.332523942627	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.238857012788	They would have to pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.189659049373	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.168096674206	Let's get rid of Assad later.
0.0	0.177850362038	I think we all support that.
0.0	0.0673649257025	So they put together this.
0.0	0.425222475464	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.465427137816	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.29973461004	Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
0.0	0.196105885312	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.319774099745	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.169525926085	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.0525184706095	Bill.
0.0	0.567640524685	They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care.
0.0	0.484893265261	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.221591935661	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.15017456431	You know, this is not easy work.
0.0	0.191042959062	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.37276015006	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.363957566552	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
0.0	0.446824621836	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.508358706214	Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.
0.0	0.176005099102	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.148602074312	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.39978606962	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.5	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
0.0	0.289825430008	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.00188580093901	...Thank you.
0.0	0.184136173616	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.278175659002	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.0280557633747	OK.
0.0	0.061973733281	Right.
0.0	0.391662527761	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.402516664957	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.310218021812	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.222519467163	And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you're a governor.
0.0	0.349230449592	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.373759832987	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
0.0	0.202422224327	It's time for real substance and real experience.
1.0	0.995267398199	Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.
0.0	0.118051411229	Just can't happen.
0.0	0.386669469366	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.447068218202	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.0884399466699	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.0633640122418	... issues they have to respond to.
0.0	0.147143712795	I beat China all the time.
0.0	0.374749481598	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.321573391001	We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.
0.0	0.413521234011	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.0661216040381	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.268701518622	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.386729905534	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.0281061214955	Very valuable.
0.0	0.0106010365496	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.151892227096	They kill us.
0.0	0.358803649056	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.426899103181	At the end of the day, if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities.
0.0	0.394061769719	And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.
0.0	0.339806488861	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.5	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.377768837619	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
0.0	0.0307536644076	Thank you, John.
0.0	0.166177986067	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.451697316087	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.209299241994	But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand.
0.0	0.384035903807	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.319920553265	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.354753657191	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.261896421662	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.448065859012	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.

0.0	0.423687221338	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.

0.0	0.250705914559	Let me give you one quick example.

0.0	0.333495840634	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.167989819138	Today I heard it.
0.0	0.338370042177	So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again.
0.0	0.0818245550793	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
0.0	0.369769907161	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.

0.0	0.0739672277869	Yes.
0.0	0.0954371907162	Well, sure.
0.0	0.316577667813	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.461313536607	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.356672089261	I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.
0.0	0.310166172065	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.404978720737	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.140478068632	They thought something was wrong.
0.0	0.450940364037	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.252828544975	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.414055137317	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.186084904741	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.3094906161	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.295578888457	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
1.0	0.955336769127	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.171626255613	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.359298491617	I released 34 years of tax returns...
0.0	0.12219274088	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.448408845135	Seventeen more million more people have health care.
0.0	0.383812243998	And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.
0.0	0.169043689325	It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino.
0.0	0.241037235042	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.225314002261	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.480752325118	And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
0.0	0.141096857533	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.276222252191	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.0307236414304	I would prioritize them.
0.0	0.0878298256168	The big banks--
0.0	0.424987150189	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.
0.0	0.178282444855	But it cannot be an American fight.
0.0	0.227605082431	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.231549711751	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.224468451548	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.335795495244	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.224803369596	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.297679723293	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.0548904012107	You're right about that.
0.0	0.269326744037	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.
0.0	0.0886424043326	But we came together.
0.0	0.5	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.173380843332	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.344544516883	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.336940076387	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.33220820177	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.24767090612	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
0.0	0.227545174668	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.117860773441	I am glad Donald is running.
0.0	0.430071937181	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.118346365517	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.469050171892	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.304043936546	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.
0.0	0.371251043112	But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible.
0.0	0.460480352266	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.47114859833	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.300646300192	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.109280952138	Now, this is getting to be fun.
0.0	0.364121327141	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.316585217503	They're building up their military to a point that is very scary.
0.0	0.220453291899	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.318569029291	I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.
0.0	0.078573222328	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.308939319287	We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
0.0	0.293698292177	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.142131684361	I mean, that's a fact.
0.0	0.163766609428	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.0620116973276	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.098741266932	Can we stop?
0.0	0.0112261892073	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.346616825411	I saw Ted Cruz say, "we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill."
0.0	0.44119303137	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.29694714469	It will give hope to millions of young people.
0.0	0.088602334991	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.255081629247	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.0808446517707	Well, thank you, John.
0.0	0.11439298031	They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.
0.0	0.178297931475	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.332212040873	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.0252172070886	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.710518003703	No, I have not.
0.0	0.368259328231	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	0.438466224684	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.161277752625	It was an investment bank.
0.0	0.336317914311	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.199695055545	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.399018769052	It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.
0.0	0.221545323094	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
0.0	0.160390080253	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.0514052136588	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.235196506532	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.328048213121	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.5	First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster.
0.0	0.141251769192	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.266944287355	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.133499171559	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.0620116973276	So, I thank you very much for that.
0.0	0.283823957487	This is what's made our nation so special.
0.0	0.301115312085	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.0563057610638	You really can't.
0.0	0.208420421044	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.336987538513	On two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago.
0.0	0.218413419522	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.345465139486	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.346440974854	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.340097171186	We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States.
0.0	0.0936911990177	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.107306467769	Our next president...
0.0	0.414483440121	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.234933755625	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.443834851282	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.378067045514	Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server.
0.0	0.208420543585	But it was also the cascading effects that followed that.
0.0	0.170632372148	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.0514052136588	You know that.
0.0	0.129272934278	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.0300865004936	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.309626265208	We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York.

0.0	0.412235258429	I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.
0.0	0.151759864902	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.278488983563	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.275149719923	Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond...
0.0	0.206111299982	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.161435941735	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.27966851151	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.116785242383	That can be done.
0.0	0.289455851489	We ought to send used equipment, right?
0.0	0.109789032127	There won't be any -- you can get it.
0.0	0.416498555421	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.284123073638	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.222436257223	That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.
0.0	0.332780125525	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.153904154153	He's the greatest show on earth.
0.0	0.247221241214	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.181427345762	End -- end Common Core.

0.0	0.364067801215	One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together.
0.0	0.113076252336	Does my family like me?
0.0	0.165982029423	And they don't know -- "Are you running?
0.0	0.218589560779	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.45734036243	So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
0.0	0.441249247148	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.250205777693	We've already got a great talker in the White House.

0.0	0.188845076503	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.277500874297	And we have people that are controlled by special interests.
0.0	0.0441677480628	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.0793693358908	But I went further than that.
0.0	0.2197907164	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.385768286876	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.347107302224	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.125196217276	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.0866874533087	Let it be for everybody.
0.0	0.0618740541777	Let's be frank here.
0.0	0.0525330833336	Ninety-three hours.
0.0	0.0921086364535	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.425807748978	If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.
0.0	0.397892875126	I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department.
0.0	0.166183673317	That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable.
0.0	0.40290027485	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.234279466391	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.430869831214	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.264206181707	The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.153782704412	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.541415030244	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.365871394869	Fifty-one percent of high school African-American graduates are unemployed or underemployed.
0.0	0.155280664479	We don't need more of the same solutions.
0.0	0.472908954942	And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.063283489311	It ain't complicated.
0.0	0.38388838013	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.301085495424	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.181601281051	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.393429685139	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.25072920656	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.202362065979	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.32321059872	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.141346820652	We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.
0.0	0.231793600333	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.393438664344	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.194847307046	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.282073808444	You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization.
0.0	0.363929414348	So, what we want to do is to say, look, we have 11 million people who have been here, many of them for decades.
0.0	0.151546475621	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.112380355104	Well, thanks for having me.
0.0	0.19313352062	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.131837969943	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.337344208112	Two weeks later, the place was blown up.
0.0	0.175979582382	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.379846509444	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.5	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.450492168178	Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, who said my plan for what we should do to reign in Wall Street was more comprehensive and better.
0.0	0.292090423482	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.289714107644	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
0.0	0.437788735404	I believe that our Federal Government needs to do more on pell grants.
0.0	0.36716767259	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.00388298097135	Chris?
0.0	0.418311785538	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.358866421756	We saw a Muslim brotherhood president installed, and then we saw him ousted and the army back.
0.0	0.284451293951	May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care?
0.0	0.0187209621408	It's not great again.
0.0	0.383797603433	For example, it is outrageous that we don't have an opportunity for Medicare to negotiate for lower prices.
0.0	0.061506265514	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.
0.0	0.269743570526	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
1.0	0.995232490937	And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.0462730582344	...before I go.
0.0	0.346918305374	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.292696116179	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.203768274762	Germany, many other countries do it already.
0.0	0.187547618743	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.384658843742	But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.
0.0	0.0422334679824	And guess what?
0.0	0.469620111463	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.0684254893368	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.491327525748	We got it done in my state by leading with principal and that's what we need to do as a party for comprehensive gun safety.
0.0	0.373650227852	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
1.0	0.550798451242	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.444070218205	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.0956236355412	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.0726267080405	We didn't spend any.
1.0	0.996464413011	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
0.0	0.132655832315	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.524647813448	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.171048851533	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.202751952184	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.047404618178	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.135523582468	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.
0.0	0.1774280586	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.299841375174	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.310063629172	It's a country in which people choose to buy guns.
0.0	0.304211471832	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.36778695555	That's what I said to my own public health people.
0.0	0.128734063703	Look, the secretary is right.
0.0	0.0215970090377	They knew that.
0.0	0.292678219268	And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.
0.0	0.266649582118	Yeah (ph), no, I think that's a -- that's a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques.
0.0	0.435645898632	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.406804967362	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.353324109079	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.459982815339	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.315371931831	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
0.0	0.332961231908	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
0.0	0.710518003703	No.
0.0	0.410250114057	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.156999151627	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.102753120276	Let's reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.349202889759	Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.
0.0	0.279242093597	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.422988710671	Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor.
0.0	0.29590082786	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.376095020175	But I said, "Don't hit Iraq," because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East.
0.0	0.242827106304	We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.
0.0	0.149981798002	I want to thank the people of Iowa for being so welcoming to me.
0.0	0.351252567458	We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president.
0.0	0.0297019472486	A step forward.
0.0	0.516208266286	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
1.0	0.982105740833	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
1.0	0.990995692621	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.37559466004	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.361446453109	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.314983342087	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.0874758156857	How are we gonna -- how are we gonna go back and make it great again?
0.0	0.405038065083	But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone.
0.0	0.447974510959	Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.
0.0	0.230220229411	And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.
0.0	0.155835548354	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.0821027343832	And I apologize to nobody for that.
0.0	0.320708504943	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.147631875781	And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.
0.0	0.435154844864	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.254566897518	They went to the DNC quietly.
0.0	0.414236274105	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.162446317226	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.349378570085	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.346923597887	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.202913174853	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
0.0	0.253671177389	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.061799932158	Good at email.
0.0	0.393591751831	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.414999587838	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.26205632474	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.137318048043	I...
0.0	0.067992959567	So nice, thank you very much.
0.0	0.371370859956	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.537902632093	He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration.
0.0	0.414903335067	But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
0.0	0.235528034057	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.402427637128	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.0485334428049	You can have him.
0.0	0.285583231399	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.347057215413	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.0601804046276	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.034254085167	That's calling it what it is.
0.0	0.0640462859525	And it's-- it's a worthy debate.
0.0	0.291685823987	You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour.
1.0	0.130397455414	They built a hotel.
0.0	0.110647398323	That is abundantly clear.
0.0	0.027742480997	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.265282468268	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.328434720056	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.373504647549	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.223827926721	All of us believe climate change is real.
0.0	0.43327818774	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.061973733281	All right.
0.0	0.710518003703	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.46086853207	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.165478904733	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.0730083952574	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.305289605659	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.0124405654189	We can't.
0.0	0.375062545573	We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents.
0.0	0.150857432478	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.127075546327	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.172795782315	But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
0.0	0.192135423158	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.514744095397	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.0220045628866	So it is difficult.
0.0	0.0779877471977	Big difference.
0.0	0.392788884041	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.472381361743	Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons.
0.0	0.0392493756107	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.242490928108	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.112591674002	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
0.0	0.249475183427	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.385847755649	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.
0.0	0.5	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.0402544534329	In addition to that...
0.0	0.150956058809	They are not going to go away on their own.
0.0	0.279830177698	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.138441214605	I know, Bret.
0.0	0.146166807291	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.172124781066	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.358385548839	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.710518003703	What are we doing?
0.0	0.0924956630429	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.17509528405	And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave.
0.0	0.311606508814	And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.
1.0	0.995148049785	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.141755743046	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.1950627103	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.14388525702	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.229117255567	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.290575780903	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.117582268366	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.141454782226	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.228065423137	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.18797261319	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.417236605714	... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.374373418598	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.234683694284	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.230596998584	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.255434538822	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.24366460496	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.315275507392	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.168658271134	He has never defended...
0.0	0.227073091282	And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen.
0.0	0.395554102411	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.369425003018	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.237112157928	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.408004044726	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.5	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.412835217712	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
0.0	0.232112855501	You've got to go the extra mile.
0.0	0.0485334428049	You can do both.
0.0	0.0424728291935	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.319026084831	I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran.
0.0	0.710518003703	Why is it...
0.0	0.163751173164	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.197769538746	Great state, great people.
0.0	0.0151590737149	He was vibrant.
0.0	0.187059168038	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.248700589358	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
1.0	0.991821080525	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.0209911248829	How would we act?
0.0	0.00455301503435	We are not France.
0.0	0.159898365042	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.183554069832	Planned Parenthood will be defunded.
0.0	0.100233370031	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.249599899632	And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce's great story.
0.0	0.235514852832	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.00747950109024	Divide that out.
0.0	0.240686020499	I know every one.
0.0	0.546294346941	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.0717821501245	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.269540612656	Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple.
0.0	0.130472703779	Please think of our founding fathers as you listen.
0.0	0.293508874641	But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.
0.0	0.5	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.373704512236	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.403844444029	I also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees.
0.0	0.284304086537	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.
0.0	0.433888370924	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.357587525248	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.377763415723	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.278125869021	I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.
0.0	0.44742964265	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.347765916123	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.226386726375	Because you realize that people depending on you.
0.0	0.306065677947	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.438361067972	Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.0768339513605	Say again?
0.0	0.155479346503	I have a comprehensive, tough plan.
0.0	0.0617029677341	And, look, there are profound differences...
0.0	0.710518003703	Why?
0.0	0.0405577265965	They're not so stupid.
0.0	0.294943514523	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.216008317175	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.145170343958	It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible.
1.0	0.991885692779	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
0.0	0.294752896447	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.189124193968	I voted against the war.
0.0	0.0542346152616	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.0624178699585	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.363076515041	But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country.
0.0	0.0903990723272	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.13071677624	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.416348137466	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.131194805002	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.261626905527	Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.
0.0	0.275421213402	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.338200165216	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.415194815839	And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.208008196303	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.254956994928	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.487838671984	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.249475321461	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.404627194307	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.013082364455	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.37705443869	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.363927303254	We have a lot of work to do, to better prepare our nation and to better lead this world into this new century.
0.0	0.471008166896	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.321857018155	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.523389698816	To get deregulated -- listen to this, they spent $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions over a 10-year period.
0.0	0.0805467703911	The formula is working.
0.0	0.250945282758	Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
0.0	0.0912765938449	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.233763533916	The number of women --
0.0	0.187412503887	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.430131285805	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.209373049572	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.0996932527741	Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC.
1.0	0.36804920814	Twenty-one mass shootings, including one last weekend in Des Moins where three were murdered.
0.0	0.0514052136588	And you know what?
0.0	0.186816621001	We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?
0.0	0.328857419613	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.0576588599079	Illegal.
0.0	0.255912500501	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.171416139967	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.213351805675	So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
0.0	0.0468495930019	That's who I'm indebted to.
0.0	0.328095082364	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.348937091139	You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.
1.0	0.492931078769	$10.10 was all I could get the state to do by the time I left in my last year.
0.0	0.22714843277	And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?
0.0	0.166350052565	And as our party's nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.355367690271	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.38309453078	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.221808563026	There has never been a jihadist group like this.
0.0	0.236176208902	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.105574027158	I do not think it would come to that.
0.0	0.350254518388	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.24224309986	They're sending us not the right people.
0.0	0.237544180339	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.100474168336	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.339789925574	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.113143172606	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.107169701581	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.366860140356	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.4124104253	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.302710488827	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.317801180772	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.424810601528	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.0949096383632	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.178766436106	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.315479668369	We also have to build a coalition at home.
0.0	0.294388254963	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.216908040871	So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.
0.0	0.318785866125	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.0644596599882	I don't care.
0.0	0.266584158556	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.355837745208	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.
0.0	0.00953846348007	I have formed them.
0.0	0.161676669493	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.252493460263	I gotta build those big buildings.
0.0	0.0068451608977	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.409800653279	We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.
0.0	0.252124934247	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.0100733409434	John?
0.0	0.395606894139	I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to -- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.
0.0	0.172393870052	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.286289052122	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.
0.0	0.286771759673	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.32232207188	We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.
0.0	0.333077479311	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.362282606361	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.199133715812	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.265343219468	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.232919810669	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.0538070879361	it won't happen.
0.0	0.163349993254	So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.310949683903	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.269377011821	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
1.0	0.487875972499	A $5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.434949080472	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.33057600528	And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting.
0.0	0.112041442241	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.407391378916	Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country -- we would never build in an ocean.
0.0	0.320823642744	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.313387841273	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.10489298877	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.231280878792	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.0957182481762	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.25606445759	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.17767925883	They are not doing it now.
0.0	0.135204316904	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.1217683253	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.0891105366519	I was not the secretary of state...
0.0	0.0859850501938	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.421604468423	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.298988392873	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.224449153919	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.135028270467	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.0671343888542	It is enormously complicated.
1.0	0.988100587723	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.119559334498	I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.
0.0	0.206863317193	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.344644275915	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.335937950751	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.164280570525	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.0436486899913	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.710518003703	But...
0.0	0.201801666609	Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.
0.0	0.308403421763	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.
0.0	0.439767327428	But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it.
0.0	0.137318048043	But I...
0.0	0.292370603998	For a start, they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes.
0.0	0.355158879222	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.225280274921	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.350758130822	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
0.0	0.315086442285	Number one, we're going to keep ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.262624550039	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.0141347454873	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.23532862228	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.061973733281	All right.
0.0	0.230168554242	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.333999315685	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.596378442461	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.171539629851	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.418453869663	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.183468099222	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.

0.0	0.30998884742	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...

0.0	0.239065279964	It's not just Wall Street.
0.0	0.374866035591	You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down.
0.0	0.226293365182	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.19318499227	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.126014888486	Let's do more -- let's do more than reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.559021579275	My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt.

0.0	0.240042337206	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.101859266456	I know the overrated ones.

0.0	0.261402923015	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.351256994582	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.180577985236	I think it's important we put this in historic context.
0.0	0.46649366056	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.00467523315279	Maria...
0.0	0.335406442296	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.149073931259	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.43162744752	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.20960801828	I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis.
0.0	0.297438678475	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.0874426043814	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.

0.0	0.508798127441	But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.
0.0	0.0885963382969	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?
0.0	0.222527248767	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.
0.0	0.267158696484	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.427070232309	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.234785913725	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.431298305323	You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?
0.0	0.137273550994	And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.
0.0	0.386104407784	And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence.
0.0	0.361978109261	We've enacted it in our state.
0.0	0.411883696446	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.394955949303	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.0433276569894	And we have nothing.
0.0	0.0853469584803	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.0897156935312	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.710518003703	It's not.
0.0	0.453493389824	The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders.
0.0	0.278273915199	And what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.395492039263	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.00974136740393	No vision at all.
0.0	0.534979011933	And, unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage, I actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.289344436794	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.481153125627	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.0280557633747	OK?
0.0	0.33943061296	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.
0.0	0.466278311731	And I was determined to do everything that I could to make VA health care the best in the world, to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending.
0.0	0.156573464257	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.331696447833	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.0848564371014	Let's have a Democratic Syria.
0.0	0.153825498543	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.17277563122	And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.
0.0	0.338603560821	And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues.
0.0	0.061973733281	She was right.
0.0	0.458405259901	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.260107609889	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.281940980311	But I guess the final thing that -- that I would say is this is the kind of debate we need to take to the Republicans in the fall.
0.0	0.28753140072	They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.253095318247	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.293024870243	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.191536683498	And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people.
0.0	0.251333719274	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.075710340785	Syria is a mess.

0.0	0.145793477376	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.359983623009	Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform.
0.0	0.356443862477	ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.
0.0	0.412082858695	We have more people in jail today than any other country on earth.
0.0	0.0996785484608	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.0538070879361	It won't happen.
0.0	0.204307894192	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
0.0	0.349766129268	Sit down with people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the house, and work on a bill.
0.0	0.419278805018	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.00293495088259	And we are not England.
1.0	0.399128461392	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.0482273912954	Believe me.
0.0	0.234078555567	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.333896749827	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.476903512636	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.200465980145	They can provide resources.
0.0	0.061973733281	All right.
0.0	0.214986128158	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.148025945046	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.10757705712	But I can tell you this.
0.0	0.0210277275103	That's crony capitalism.
0.0	0.167188629667	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.410089507801	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.0948713126477	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.159847630113	How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
0.0	0.217355882578	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.179707037927	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.291854368624	They should have made it more open ended for the next president.
0.0	0.265881932302	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.175813373589	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.31025450209	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.287736120051	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.300543251778	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.231870192237	But I have another one, Ford.
0.0	0.156473120259	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.157042377051	First of all...
0.0	0.159202160705	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.29553040812	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
0.0	0.44123592413	And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and I would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go.
0.0	0.0871771330408	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.00334292388666	David...
0.0	0.451607299026	And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.
0.0	0.0179524675706	Neil...

0.0	0.17767925883	We now have that.
0.0	0.037909600667	This is an emergency.
0.0	0.400159553412	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.166426544418	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.442561224491	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.208292480578	He was putting his 10 and 12-year-old boys to bed the other night.
0.0	0.239581466852	They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?
0.0	0.223450070071	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.00761772055137	He's very charming.
0.0	0.0730083952574	Don't believe it.
1.0	0.55790672562	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.509610926348	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.100233370031	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.293262157426	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.44106299392	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.448723448035	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.14547859315	Obama is going to be out playing golf.
0.0	0.292939062542	And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.
0.0	0.248045237832	Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.231896003538	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.119667216442	Yeah, but let me respond...
0.0	0.1772576546	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.339414845596	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
0.0	0.0190942097532	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.39493715796	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.371147557446	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.436786595821	We cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of moral nations around this Earth, we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats, because Martha, this will not be the last region where nation-states fail.
0.0	0.190252008883	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.192282921559	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.295092961189	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.488056589797	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.25490171461	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.710518003703	No their not.
0.0	0.157608496901	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
1.0	0.9871861081	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.289191528541	And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.
0.0	0.48061664218	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.212359633843	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.0612330951083	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.237899894613	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.366071702955	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.168863976325	We have to get the remaining 10.

0.0	0.29979320515	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.287899401338	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.376256534779	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.263715795185	Making fun of disabled people...
0.0	0.374246698977	I think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12 it would be the highest historical average we've ever had.
0.0	0.0670318218623	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.583131149063	We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government.
0.0	0.179183856352	I didn't say permanently.
1.0	0.989255645682	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.574377786986	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.
0.0	0.337127867951	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.47652664264	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.424550615681	Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent.
0.0	0.250137830183	And most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that.
0.0	0.536397950302	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.231615055703	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.401375273992	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.0876589989575	This is a war for the soul of Islam.

0.0	0.342847460652	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.362280903006	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.
0.0	0.406206659026	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.284703983283	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.347883171499	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.0449971085668	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.30385003071	You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster.
0.0	0.454190692377	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.

0.0	0.0136253540932	He's not a leader.
0.0	0.176463868524	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.16450874983	Marco can change his mind.
0.0	0.40270374172	If we are not successful, if we continue the same old, same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big-money interests, nothing changes.
0.0	0.360268296145	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.228221731494	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.061973733281	Right?
0.0	0.409491802456	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.19981530792	We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.
0.0	0.710518003703	Not at all.
0.0	0.344423608882	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.710518003703	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.0800028935492	I do respect Rand.
0.0	0.0614727818397	That makes no sense at all.
0.0	0.283046300354	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.434772246194	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.258139837985	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.508642356873	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.0304575845678	They will not.
0.0	0.218061074664	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.320524234551	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
0.0	0.33591333705	We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love -- they're great -- all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.
0.0	0.0634817562879	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.180772919842	I will work my heart out.
0.0	0.710518003703	I have...
0.0	0.187863200215	And so, you go the extra mile.
0.0	0.089560930109	We don't have victories anymore.
0.0	0.0124668461184	Excuse me.
0.0	0.289081624696	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.405795340586	When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war.
0.0	0.54313002699	Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.
0.0	0.139750531805	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.470294519093	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.0603891116205	And we're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.0921680365763	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.160236436684	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.363427059599	The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.
1.0	0.985326088789	And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.
0.0	0.298253301526	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.0679690658676	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.00986126543763	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.191997977746	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.268529013142	It's a divided country on guns.
0.0	0.100903437496	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.194384476024	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.112266430801	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.274251971456	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
0.0	0.240483473418	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.450535678347	That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
0.0	0.306933478316	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.
0.0	0.0812910621826	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.0669760320535	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.460393540416	That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive.
0.0	0.126111891268	This will end.
0.0	0.198618231258	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.156693497354	We never dreamt we'd ever see it."
0.0	0.00931140083931	I was for legalization.
1.0	0.426617253177	We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.0577422280193	Credibility counts.
1.0	0.195538358624	I did introduce legislation to reign in compensation.
0.0	0.182382133663	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.417714245497	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.166623544157	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.285855562502	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.336153634642	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.468474687719	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.
0.0	0.352902048555	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.182551313348	That is the clear and present danger.
0.0	0.334237879898	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.239202482863	We need sound money.
0.0	0.367422458708	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.516042350708	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.303394484215	But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
0.0	0.338832638328	Let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.710518003703	2,000?
0.0	0.228488952419	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.061973733281	Right.
0.0	0.140816201387	We've got to hate the Muslims."
0.0	0.180760583872	I would invite him, I actually would say.
0.0	0.214539324957	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.18056984182	We need money.
0.0	0.243845570137	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.0926681676481	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.382619535418	How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years.
0.0	0.0612607256133	We're dying.
1.0	0.511332622369	According to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.237855995272	As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.364741786062	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.254670255859	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.126814455178	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.322011849439	And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.
0.0	0.111880456227	We did a lot to help.
0.0	0.0959915661067	I said, "Is he intelligent?"
0.0	0.710518003703	That is what we have to do.
0.0	0.0804859569178	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.5	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.0284442485882	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.0984011113472	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.182013719519	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.206881312841	How are they going to beat ISIS?
0.0	0.218193251033	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.508097437528	At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.
1.0	0.55999481128	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.342207252648	But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
0.0	0.121479538297	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.142680898318	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.424080878457	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.399046476485	That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.
0.0	0.520897655697	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.182717058621	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.32810337064	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.418249030481	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.320654787936	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.260989963318	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.388273886553	And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.
0.0	0.367987177445	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.

0.0	0.0165572223146	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.330753558266	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.384497126259	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.176280158202	I don't think we're at war with all Muslims.
0.0	0.0311103332252	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.354805341021	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.0306267853522	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.304714478161	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.113269657501	My patients are beside themselves.
0.0	0.304876609544	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
0.0	0.38296318166	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.341707953013	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.423103075547	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.0761784371169	I agree completely.
0.0	0.183242094712	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.461798537171	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.00690966697353	It's nice.
0.0	0.257200614349	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.

0.0	0.488661119993	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.0405016314413	They're not good.
0.0	0.203471309347	And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
0.0	0.462323303812	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.331300508164	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.249737156507	KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.
0.0	0.391398381108	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.305692593245	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.

0.0	0.307778866901	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.0575617888281	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.363837794796	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.241169699895	Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.

0.0	0.10757705712	That I can tell you.
0.0	0.57409572014	I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.
0.0	0.48842392235	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.0372604788089	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.0759681162961	You get a lot of them that are overrated.

0.0	0.286035012065	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.254917333004	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.176069127329	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
1.0	0.282697983501	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.417982978703	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.330328846425	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.304157166158	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.362612040716	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.457553772896	When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up.
0.0	0.250575112856	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.292800861508	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
0.0	0.279533348315	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.0482273912954	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.359903129886	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.390524785067	And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.
0.0	0.348381056017	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.133921099809	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.350509678902	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.359749831709	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.0843112319145	It is a tragedy all over this country.
0.0	0.228760680127	I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video.
0.0	0.101409853127	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.166139516377	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.268905181645	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.26495188806	We went after those who had attacked us.
0.0	0.26282557688	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.520129796274	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.409747580158	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.18530188355	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
1.0	0.975253430609	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
0.0	0.0623115452334	I don't think so.
0.0	0.456584837783	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.333561212889	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.306326380533	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.361254329764	You can -- you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.
0.0	0.185081715664	Man (ph), their mother's here as well.
0.0	0.349239130436	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.462289680656	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.415201718383	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.531550896357	But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks.
0.0	0.0137612989158	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.0674098650294	Washington is broken.
1.0	0.98568773844	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.357270502984	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
0.0	0.194468494414	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.0634127392527	That's a drag on the economy.
0.0	0.307608744392	This entire question was an attack, but that's (inaudible)
0.0	0.0838833527016	Those are all really positive developments.
0.0	0.427261076935	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
1.0	0.99438174366	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.159226481322	We talked about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.196472890099	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
0.0	0.106120454497	And that's not what's happening now.
1.0	0.585806527547	People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.
0.0	0.125018711988	There's been no crowd like this.
0.0	0.223064222816	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.298361960913	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.121908048983	Now, here's what is going to happen.
0.0	0.157449544066	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.202330308251	You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America.
0.0	0.527019415098	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.354821400485	And, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like Gadhafi, a despot with American blood on his hands, is overturned.
0.0	0.710518003703	You did.
0.0	0.284284062026	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.0249424664683	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.341112004443	There's too much -- it's like -- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
0.0	0.199456112559	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.0717026811628	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.344951391922	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.237689140836	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.132693369048	But what -- I will tell you this.
0.0	0.32298777948	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.295394415537	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.24793336163	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.059855901297	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.451374544277	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.34108823509	... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.408300091427	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.406267780227	We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.
0.0	0.169540884963	Fact check me.
0.0	0.0987939631119	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.18513089039	He's been a negative force.
0.0	0.34151680241	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.383206097066	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.0263543167051	They're off to China.
0.0	0.307800873808	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.195993906967	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.350118170986	On January 20th, 2017, the next president of the United States will walk into the White House.
0.0	0.0836772338952	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.5	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
1.0	0.976780221029	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.311464157987	I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones.
0.0	0.308832790631	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.129820799277	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.187667776516	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.346176575117	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.39273340939	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.221992424916	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.360759587165	So the total is $8,737,540,00.
0.0	0.291893412416	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.229545194814	Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC.
1.0	0.441582451456	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.0178443535932	Wait for what?
0.0	0.301822529388	We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy.
0.0	0.206003652672	You know why three?
0.0	0.292104572131	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.436519982367	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
0.0	0.144442918672	I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.2187752843	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.14053938071	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.144206122353	Whoever heard of this?
0.0	0.335243746326	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.193500966947	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.29144747702	The central question in this race is trust.
0.0	0.436442062128	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.421002353699	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.0856647436554	Well, they're glitches because...
0.0	0.44638077227	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.710518003703	That has not been...
0.0	0.2082384955	I'd suggest people take a look at it.
0.0	0.207700515547	White people?
0.0	0.182660909333	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.378524676251	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.279906636518	Marco opposed this because they made a deal.
0.0	0.389296389425	One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this, is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations.
0.0	0.0800432499476	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.388724997274	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.302652249484	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.529134516041	Some of the bravest people that I had the privilege of working with as secretary of state were our development professionals who went sometimes alone, sometimes with our military, into very dangerous places in Iraq, in Afghanistan, elsewhere.
0.0	0.273207241712	But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.
0.0	0.175355826668	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.184866081271	Well, I would just repeat that.
0.0	0.0941207282419	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.209898443804	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.400902003808	We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
0.0	0.403448333436	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.227558225185	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.388857285864	Parents, and sons, and daughters and family members, and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them, we must remember this, that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century.
0.0	0.00752550277499	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.171811786128	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.290383556286	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.182496975708	I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary...
0.0	0.521210640897	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.0393225942364	And I've been there.

0.0	0.330455546479	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.321674472128	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.201478558318	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.143305340392	We've gotten off the Hillary's e-mails, good.
0.0	0.169538759494	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.330712567751	And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details.
0.0	0.132883256512	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.267207845443	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.0869460641451	Somebody said -- thank you, darlin'.
0.0	0.234940825721	... we will secure the border...
0.0	0.452771209863	Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground.
0.0	0.270894082551	This is not the type of campaign that we run.
0.0	0.338034368351	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
1.0	0.966189642482	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
0.0	0.399195023934	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.34399502736	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
0.0	0.309856181093	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.

0.0	0.310804459986	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
1.0	0.995519423788	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.0906664611168	Go on to my website.
0.0	0.0684810827419	You're certainly not very good.
0.0	0.315851272679	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
0.0	0.220209643202	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.27256349896	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.184419314138	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.34489391591	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.111730944974	And there are many ways of doing it.
1.0	0.996704648023	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.

0.0	0.139831096494	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.39090238526	... and I think -- you know, Governor -- Jeb, you -- the attack that -- the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS.
0.0	0.0623115452334	So I don't think...
0.0	0.0248401830082	Absolutely.
0.0	0.0784461865145	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.290643245517	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.33466371265	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.229419167508	But this is what we also have to say.
0.0	0.36098691543	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.479452143941	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.210241177694	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.444469136861	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.221420072039	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.425626869143	And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.
0.0	0.353607940758	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.368165081455	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.107467747111	May I respond to the critique on the ...

0.0	0.00777394269265	He undermines it.
0.0	0.516766252819	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.461949114357	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.351329741701	First priority, destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.213054075766	And we ought to fight them on that level.
0.0	0.0313558961978	I would change them.
0.0	0.212701227209	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.0171317391057	Wow.
0.0	0.364983716949	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.341985974014	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
0.0	0.28248769634	Wall Street is a threat to the economy.

0.0	0.284641164855	And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.
0.0	0.0248401830082	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.146103618893	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.
0.0	0.0706160083159	We don't need that.

0.0	0.118300989038	It goes away.
0.0	0.320924640535	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.105480364409	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.0881366505899	Yes, I'm getting...
1.0	0.992690742177	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.0341441801501	How has it worked?
1.0	0.592293934231	And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions.
0.0	0.309906212609	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.298641426676	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.
0.0	0.416539175222	They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.
1.0	0.973912909249	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
0.0	0.0952266481352	I gotta do it, Dad.
0.0	0.0601455394239	That's the good news.
0.0	0.189970498921	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.230848755841	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.329300530405	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.319131658939	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.54609090742	And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.
0.0	0.2764065716	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.474435375473	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.0846256253945	She's an American citizen.
0.0	0.13716667908	I didn't inherit any money.
1.0	0.428010493675	We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.439139270415	As president, I will support law enforcement and we'll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community.
0.0	0.306527933113	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.235625919109	And he asked me to support that.
0.0	0.0411297956416	I think what is...
0.0	0.456759579614	Real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years.
0.0	0.455557534697	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.0468676305008	He can't have it both ways.
0.0	0.211246434361	You can't be in favor of defend us...
0.0	0.209626045752	We need new leadership.
0.0	0.240048933926	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.188084776836	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.220676285444	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
1.0	0.989195913802	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.159808712934	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.247259875709	And, here's what she said to the American people.
0.0	0.343786463045	One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy.
0.0	0.138411947736	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.269983417703	No, both the federal and a state approach.
0.0	0.33690808907	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
1.0	0.978122125219	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
0.0	0.29576371692	And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
0.0	0.0372462969267	No, it's true.
0.0	0.224752031807	I give a lot of money away to charities and other things.
0.0	0.262809749794	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
1.0	0.990614017349	Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.
0.0	0.0959625654915	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.41229876087	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.211187021067	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.518376024877	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.275539337002	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.23970262367	Can I share this quick story?
0.0	0.427716142137	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.306850866053	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.710518003703	I do.
0.0	0.462813458552	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.
0.0	0.350978137044	And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.
0.0	0.336908498368	And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.
0.0	0.280243007036	Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said.
0.0	0.338768585879	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.179892608711	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.13107294844	You know, Ted didn't show up.
0.0	0.279827219889	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.461779103115	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.
0.0	0.237478806666	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.0323100323436	You find me...
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.157263719272	They wouldn't be there except for us.
0.0	0.260138519396	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.270816824229	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.109608359276	We ended up with 56 votes.
0.0	0.337015008237	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.190208979777	I never said that.
0.0	0.375269360861	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.385224350493	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
1.0	0.98204362877	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.0306845510345	That is the issue.
0.0	0.0987977338894	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.222519757586	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.091508144796	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.202141301933	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.240683149297	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.353610816982	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.257082753092	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.456028173097	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.261607532163	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.0560531840632	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.233120490656	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.00679656472327	What would we do if this were ebola?
0.0	0.0807647492895	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.428235648055	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.5	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.
0.0	0.16604291909	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.380490881476	If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs.
0.0	0.149089208833	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.376665574472	I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.
0.0	0.395225661502	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.186068439479	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.222591049801	A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.
0.0	0.348428739584	The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign.
0.0	0.424385634506	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.423239409033	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.377456948677	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.142202256372	We have tremendous people.
0.0	0.306479881462	And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.
0.0	0.233936165613	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.466171039385	Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems.
0.0	0.265398870366	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.247699407536	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
0.0	0.359687529718	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.175822951822	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.344978013548	You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country.
0.0	0.0254733231228	That's fine.
0.0	0.392392468782	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.38645519668	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.100903437496	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.00778817644474	We haven't.
0.0	0.402386080161	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.408229570221	These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy, and our economic power in alignment with our principles.
0.0	0.0396301518765	I'm ready.
0.0	0.0066886835484	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.210961312057	We have to come together as a country.
0.0	0.617748745352	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.400480843888	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.215666703886	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.239456184193	I'd sign that executive order.
1.0	0.990272322651	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.533665620183	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.235749275212	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.36483479221	So I believe that, in fact, this country needs to move towards a living wage.
0.0	0.251334143373	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.206003652672	You know why three?
0.0	0.399700411558	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.118054951921	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.130270165718	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.
0.0	0.0371018933085	I like China.
0.0	0.368100322488	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.
0.0	0.263216630956	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.320594115667	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.217789750279	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
1.0	0.984664852907	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.289076969952	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.315956665623	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.
0.0	0.402826093382	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.251113827048	I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.0619445393825	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.295898693611	I've had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say, I don't agree with you on everything, but I like what you do.
0.0	0.255100975688	Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees.
0.0	0.172301792448	They will be our early warning signal.
0.0	0.0538946932699	I'm the only person...
0.0	0.294778688769	I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart.
0.0	0.130386900025	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.340934731156	And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians, who are also flying in that space.
0.0	0.0801053096695	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.183753295034	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.129703941431	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.0461672712318	Let's...
0.0	0.189519299738	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.
0.0	0.241260988944	I believe that the goal should be debt-free college.
0.0	0.462352273053	But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.
0.0	0.430604053159	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.285844800669	Got to go to Haiti last year.
0.0	0.181601281051	But actually I am.
0.0	0.29201811785	Yes, and it was the same one that President Obama made.
0.0	0.353218946909	and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States.
0.0	0.0518234833551	Well, I did.
0.0	0.547684194414	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.427950511947	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.237538138687	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.399414008433	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.346483247551	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
0.0	0.41573242238	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.171986880702	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.181549997005	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.402831239474	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.119385348568	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.297289280503	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.129695968741	Of course.
0.0	0.379934332767	And that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums.
0.0	0.385307818861	First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty.
0.0	0.350972523394	So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
0.0	0.601198449395	Trillions of dollars have gone from the middle class and working families to the top one-tenth of one percent who have doubled the percentage of wealth they now own.
0.0	0.394711207142	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.328215241416	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
0.0	0.211045531065	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.403832818147	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.215109053188	Right there, right next to the plant.
1.0	0.544377980245	$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work.
0.0	0.5	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.439926324417	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.397260037971	Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military.
0.0	0.0945860427628	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.17328960314	You cannot grant amnesty.
0.0	0.450485764961	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.339674332623	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.17034852594	Well, I'll tell you who is on my side.
0.0	0.165987131002	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.255268264727	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.257899563867	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.364391442983	We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
0.0	0.256426076876	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.259863023049	And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.
0.0	0.272671636255	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.311545434879	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.370304464511	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.710518003703	Why is that?
0.0	0.327668151956	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.356067614416	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.246965194643	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.0987247675187	I've done it.
0.0	0.355937521653	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
1.0	0.155207963127	They're bringing crime.
0.0	0.135501382112	You know, I've always had a great deal of respect.
0.0	0.334894851474	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.165831856103	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.485333162185	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.311622730459	And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them.
0.0	0.0622007416109	My point is this.
0.0	0.442156055946	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.197263296398	Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem.
0.0	0.266618057088	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.432249171425	And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans.
0.0	0.0889826491319	He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
0.0	0.10503036027	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.
0.0	0.218642219428	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.00497223361121	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.319666187745	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.384316017498	I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money.
0.0	0.263550982222	You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying.
0.0	0.469306457839	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.287938521457	Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.
0.0	0.165517113684	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.141004228274	Common Core should -- it is a disaster.
0.0	0.281914155216	It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.
0.0	0.263409979829	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.32774938939	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.417184128881	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.332720976701	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.286458730556	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.37951518109	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.212474350507	But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.266199924677	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.276989749893	Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world.
0.0	0.44921712546	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.319068824897	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.451444032939	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.258973879181	We have people that aren't working.
0.0	0.205884358123	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.100823753398	They sweated like dogs.
0.0	0.321610269184	... and I encourage everybody watching this tonight to please, acknowledge that by going online at martinomalley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism.
0.0	0.203879069728	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.445500838967	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.155944491677	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.462006788066	She has devoted her life, when I was mayor of the city of Burlington, actually when I first met her, we started a youth office, which started a after-school programs for kids, started a child care center, started a youth newspaper.
0.0	0.176038552392	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.459416624761	John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL, and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening.
0.0	0.061973733281	Right.
0.0	0.248492691789	Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president.
0.0	0.181601281051	We actually did it.
0.0	0.275756922565	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.390457425585	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.287209660225	By actually doing more for education.
0.0	0.293900585859	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.279330303193	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.536910040898	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.360821698661	I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college.
0.0	0.291021404974	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.530236631492	Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.
0.0	0.217908252431	So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has.
0.0	0.296408431215	... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message.
0.0	0.201878456878	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.412808466762	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.167768721965	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.152288025453	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.321298716318	I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.
0.0	0.5	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.412966888475	And, of course, I met the mothers of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, and Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and so many of them who have lost their children.
0.0	0.237076912328	In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men.
0.0	0.446977137065	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
1.0	0.957084830955	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.458072044827	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.176241795331	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.0482273912954	Here's what I believe.
0.0	0.0372462969267	That's not true.
0.0	0.252219183272	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.
0.0	0.434094839468	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
1.0	0.446182377786	We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.
0.0	0.0337103611458	They have no choice.
0.0	0.345689750809	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.516357080866	They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.
1.0	0.989203868661	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.2737427019	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.
0.0	0.329236190213	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.0957222374492	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.391619508578	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.308324336838	We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force.
0.0	0.0579258899501	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.0623115452334	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.107604277814	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.225117055407	Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
1.0	0.486863670436	But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works.
0.0	0.464360487314	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.354171351634	Good company.... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in -- and I wouldn't even use -- you know, I have -- I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
0.0	0.409540294731	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.221209763822	Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy.
0.0	0.216739103153	So I said, "That's OK." I'm proud of my net worth.
0.0	0.0422334679824	And guess what?
0.0	0.238747623892	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
1.0	0.978582272549	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.566476829654	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.2327333971	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.314972431761	That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities.
0.0	0.348496461116	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.243802973725	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.215357152083	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.0800672942778	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.608647240541	If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.

0.0	0.267203977679	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.475086710443	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.191332416473	Well, I mean right here.
1.0	0.515218878458	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty, and we're the only country in the world -- virtually the only country that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.2094964247	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.447210178405	You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
0.0	0.222588643765	So there's more to my plan than just the cap.
0.0	0.424739095451	The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.
0.0	0.384078673864	In terms of Wall Street, I respectfully disagree with you, madam secretary, in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth.
0.0	0.238533514598	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.323275251241	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.391812918647	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.224327088983	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.061973733281	Right.
0.0	0.19706045266	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.293017965893	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
0.0	0.366252294914	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.143654893153	Sadly, the American dream is dead.
0.0	0.307734714105	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.348679107203	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.193567569016	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.315542024893	I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up.
0.0	0.0709585730625	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.478677178944	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.483177917661	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.299941729096	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
0.0	0.469119494283	And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.
0.0	0.388426632247	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0213435450709	How stupid are they?
0.0	0.388430190657	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.
0.0	0.418746858532	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.351536830948	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.455006750112	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.263157737614	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.

0.0	0.0420165727158	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.207832409529	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.

0.0	0.443187121004	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.142131024285	Secretary Clinton is right.
0.0	0.182675130103	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.

0.0	0.0864451284421	You don't have to say that.

0.0	0.440486242249	Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers.
0.0	0.0826919967363	Look at my family.
0.0	0.441352695046	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.482694392573	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.186971044435	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.47375442066	Kathie, that is the kind of economy I believe, put money in the hands of working people, raise the minimum wage to 15 buck an hour.
0.0	0.344589236673	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.181089038598	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
0.0	0.270577230245	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.359570787856	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.346066483495	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.0922047777583	Afghanistan is a mess.
0.0	0.213828404224	You've got to be on top of it.
0.0	0.34736708246	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.
0.0	0.0812463145381	What are you going to do for my kids?
0.0	0.35922500995	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.346475987304	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.242399884736	That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.
0.0	0.233395920056	We'll be filing it right on time.
0.0	0.478867921148	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
0.0	0.266233554018	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.0187149606011	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.38832259964	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.217343630057	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.278206374113	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.20914706117	They like to ask direct questions.
0.0	0.202297362646	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
1.0	0.473574003535	And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent.
0.0	0.229879053026	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.277887125052	No interest," because I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.242801616905	And it has three parts.
0.0	0.482608496675	I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.
0.0	0.10590468012	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.434559221714	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.398654069226	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
0.0	0.412761675176	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.103401679662	Did a couple of cataract surgeries over Christmas holidays.
0.0	0.374672687809	I don't know and with all due respect to the secretary, Wall Street played by the rules?
0.0	0.0915723242113	But you know what else they're anxious about?
0.0	0.437243480291	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.364203912913	It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably -- probably -- from the Middle East.
0.0	0.332361340578	That is why we need to make police -- and I speak as a former mayor.
0.0	0.257799891891	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.567135157765	I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.
0.0	0.44380376419	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.19016155154	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.0946356241465	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.214139514441	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.0540367526989	But I learned a lot.
0.0	0.205285586269	They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.
0.0	0.486425658746	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.0773762863684	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.168556405063	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.189706221708	I would just...
0.0	0.0280557633747	OK?
0.0	0.360065747293	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
0.0	0.192587832584	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.34264552878	I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.
0.0	0.34457808277	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.280631202822	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.356829350378	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.246507903748	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.221738607624	The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court?
0.0	0.484875198928	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.164246154233	And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.
0.0	0.104113168673	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.0411297956416	Think about it.
0.0	0.381735774641	The endorsements that I'm proud of are conservative leaders like Dr. James Dobson, and over 700,000 contributions nationwide, people going to our Web site, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.158371722295	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.320055134251	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.201395489378	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.42168785808	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.280929734269	And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that.
0.0	0.227735883161	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.0411012940799	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.350487959226	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.710518003703	No.
0.0	0.464530909183	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.0321659753336	So I would say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.0462730582344	Go on to martinomalley.com.
0.0	0.37241223452	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.154454377423	So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there.
0.0	0.187792742105	But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything -- everything, they got away with it again.
0.0	0.204786964567	But states need to do more as well.
0.0	0.306885773558	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.34289445039	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.166557844494	He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, "No interest."
0.0	0.240158545218	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.285216704395	Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.
0.0	0.350145070526	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.227881921462	Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take.
0.0	0.488298952459	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.254345146772	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.159609420283	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.25206548943	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.136278498459	Let me just...
0.0	0.181496023723	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.195715463838	And it's impossible for our people here to compete.
1.0	0.0780841366669	We owe Japan more than that.
0.0	0.112266430801	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.111611506184	There are thing that can be done.
0.0	0.0106010365496	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.37840006801	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.209001252705	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.195555129627	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.0723687752865	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.180826301112	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.304021561428	I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...
0.0	0.267574965702	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.
0.0	0.124617168033	But let's be clear.
0.0	0.34329144785	Our country is being run by incompetent people.

0.0	0.437334723776	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
0.0	0.197535736966	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.152743104646	So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.
0.0	0.268215578974	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.385997566522	Against the Republican leadership, who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies.
0.0	0.358279222813	Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.
0.0	0.466344649669	What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years.
0.0	0.378401401615	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.102327524675	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.

0.0	0.337894771624	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.291823657795	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.463291140391	I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider.
0.0	0.302099581436	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.
0.0	0.245010463979	It's very important we operate on both at the same time.
0.0	0.302960330592	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.261368469218	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.121901579388	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.233134236603	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.0848524859807	You have all of these disastrous airports.
0.0	0.227253535163	A few days ago a similar incident happened.
0.0	0.195577376556	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.340710877275	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.562093245169	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.

0.0	0.0124405654189	We can't do it.
0.0	0.443326684635	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.

0.0	0.0454558146695	I'm getting to that.
0.0	0.176093627771	And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party, but of President Obama.
0.0	0.165394991331	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.12899585967	It's virtually useless.
0.0	0.134905997086	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
0.0	0.409622511971	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.

0.0	0.0405044774608	And I hear their speeches.
0.0	0.112032733895	Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.
0.0	0.306686309481	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.417290625027	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
0.0	0.129962162599	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.361536443297	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.00825495763001	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.34646705846	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.407256483404	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.30127213742	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.0898591663813	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.206885327959	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.230059119253	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.289751853262	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.162830068187	And there is a lot we can do in college affordability.
0.0	0.239202482863	We need sound money.
0.0	0.299209132367	Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid.
0.0	0.354273954244	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.560118506356	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.31518876161	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
1.0	0.991828247085	ISIL videos, ISIL training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in America is at a gun show.
0.0	0.0513661743053	We have to do something.
0.0	0.377068871242	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.282564888545	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.159149487988	And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.
0.0	0.415447293761	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.15974343651	It -- it doesn't need to be that way.
0.0	0.0677304453757	I'm tested.
0.0	0.289581619832	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.436864706976	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.198131633769	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.201026162019	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.452802305783	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.21231952871	They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.
0.0	0.571963335234	Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.
0.0	0.0411297956416	I think that is...
0.0	0.340729589415	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.356122445458	We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.222698435873	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.335679875371	We have people that have no incentive to work.
0.0	0.311171281301	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.234116110686	When you come back to me, I'll share that story.
0.0	0.400807378141	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.156864110136	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.19333355885	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.0619486031853	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.335476571421	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.412649146925	And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.311589303204	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.28330263394	And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.
1.0	0.484389592656	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.0907731589613	David, I am the very first...
0.0	0.0711563334574	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.710518003703	...
0.0	0.318493560977	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.131736186618	From top to bottom.
0.0	0.170996720818	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.522039930397	We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations.
0.0	0.346052824645	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.
0.0	0.353924049169	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.0802163588115	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.148166952156	She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.
0.0	0.0743114252007	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.248429349154	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.344792725417	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.241369041865	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.360291637547	I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.
0.0	0.374700986275	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.239124801006	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.528567321031	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.360726619455	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.161460370102	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.559315293836	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.269458897333	Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice.
0.0	0.00988429898123	There is a vacuum.
0.0	0.271905260105	Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months.
0.0	0.27932722328	And America's best days are in front of us if we move forward together.
0.0	0.327605213086	And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.
0.0	0.317010227461	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.
0.0	0.0458590080591	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.358298475279	... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before.
0.0	0.203835238946	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.24642073028	Terrorism in this country scares everyone.
0.0	0.416886692564	We can in fact create jobs and provide job security.
0.0	0.274613823044	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
0.0	0.262966922887	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.0295610589852	Both served.
0.0	0.185863471848	And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.
0.0	0.431641494685	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.482380217094	And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.421937045423	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.304406198507	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.383104012911	I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
0.0	0.253116227684	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
0.0	0.2185972617	Martha, we offered a lot more than they were willing to take.
0.0	0.311826170808	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.214167047112	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.146197265004	And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president.
0.0	0.160025179726	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.640586203064	Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.
0.0	0.369667581589	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.506762075006	And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.
0.0	0.31622568723	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.309319264859	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.168574555243	You learn that threats always change.
0.0	0.221977178808	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.394510556076	I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.
0.0	0.214730250776	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.384018638222	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.118086092732	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.0186977172279	I win.
0.0	0.2985612198	So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
0.0	0.401980139389	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.47444078282	But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.176817076783	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.0419640387677	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.389754354977	Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us.
0.0	0.106114796528	Our president doesn't have a clue.
0.0	0.337175402413	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.231440017105	And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.
0.0	0.117208213907	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.360219164513	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.
0.0	0.163381442399	I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.
0.0	0.0347969006829	It was terrible.
0.0	0.271368468815	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
1.0	0.545859000968	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.200246295467	to save a company.
1.0	0.981887425347	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.229056225631	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.436126123644	I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
0.0	0.472440771856	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.
0.0	0.196714243102	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.359161589264	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.185107031438	And I applaud his record in Maryland.
0.0	0.305750414949	Karen and I have seven children.
1.0	0.105626843427	He's not wall street.
0.0	0.172673807637	I want this bill to be voted down.
0.0	0.222563665198	Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.
0.0	0.0779552407539	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.441633026467	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.
0.0	0.400012528779	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.0607265435931	I feel like...
0.0	0.220462494197	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.0297019472486	It is a step forward.
0.0	0.110804413271	Folks, it's not too late.
0.0	0.0100279355024	We have losers.
0.0	0.257516582379	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.224026616925	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.226723024917	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
0.0	0.013082364455	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.0265747412234	He's very upset.
0.0	0.148983516918	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.188859061642	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.223565775115	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.383651472415	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.351847979259	And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.
0.0	0.210334924523	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.299035077116	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.242997291929	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.21183287132	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...
0.0	0.374753944689	He said, "we have the military in the streets right now.
1.0	0.419399281387	Well, we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists.
0.0	0.424842281837	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.307830317286	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.340530990975	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.199835167231	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.
0.0	0.331791724149	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.139670426177	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.35710504294	Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity.
0.0	0.137122922885	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.710518003703	...
0.0	0.256794953599	I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.
0.0	0.193983250002	But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future.
0.0	0.253147332494	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.261413848321	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.133139936364	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.222841650158	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.136700602393	But you don't hear that from anybody else.
0.0	0.439787701799	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.00188580093901	Thank you.
0.0	0.273485830628	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
1.0	0.453272727198	I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded.
0.0	0.0461672712318	Let me...
0.0	0.19664938698	You can go to opensecrets.org and check that.
0.0	0.252795993939	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.562417268112	She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.0898814622549	I think he is right.
0.0	0.522686815461	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.0941502307663	Good evening.
0.0	0.261302414235	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.329975649314	Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.
0.0	0.710518003703	But...
0.0	0.270064236416	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.375164725525	And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.
0.0	0.0347131535668	They're great.
0.0	0.267509692402	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
0.0	0.00497223361121	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.408078734034	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.710518003703	We have to do it.
0.0	0.122130484977	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.222145288521	We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
0.0	0.141988835424	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.395561883814	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.315592507579	Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
0.0	0.186029615077	That's the wrong number.
0.0	0.124508218024	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.0956511483682	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.0576302289671	There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.
1.0	0.40347050729	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.0710714764289	...the only reason is -- look...
0.0	0.410594074222	So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act.
0.0	0.274106311094	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.0490651956353	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.265035017454	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.0618484184324	It can happen.
0.0	0.382362350186	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.0253739424072	I have no idea.
0.0	0.334943750268	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.192887191315	Let me just say this...
0.0	0.198307335179	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.268939099538	This nation is the most powerful military in the world.
0.0	0.57654933756	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.389902565318	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.269097290032	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.158767130069	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.0910466716378	... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.
0.0	0.178184920159	He believes everything he stands for.
0.0	0.44414589233	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.356122119643	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.0218754275413	What sense is that?
0.0	0.215006929674	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.314475088011	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.27533434263	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
0.0	0.0124844913107	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.125755908686	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.412916456664	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.168994093188	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.119569753507	We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
0.0	0.108623040814	Mark my words.
0.0	0.489048898426	But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.
0.0	0.21828592076	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.0739672277869	Yes.
0.0	0.201554323713	Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.
0.0	0.253116357854	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.350528156948	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.343149042203	And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
0.0	0.318448813192	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.307379161094	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.
0.0	0.342349794567	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.294760464089	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.431987661642	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.437371970525	In fact, if you remember, 50, 60 years ago, the University of California, City University of New York were virtually tuition-free.
0.0	0.181886409082	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.175747163706	That will change everything.
0.0	0.0196719483188	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.130324928643	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.439254393716	When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.290325065469	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.470369711635	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.366632711727	John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.
0.0	0.037342979885	Check it out.
0.0	0.248482766956	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.253345888329	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.
0.0	0.321119905322	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
1.0	0.440331383072	Well, John, look, I think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis to leave by 2011, is that an Iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend Iraq.
0.0	0.349487037789	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.176369447234	You want one?
0.0	0.291086002471	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.
0.0	0.0304575845678	I will...
0.0	0.179417283187	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.464575449171	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.372876011028	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.0694366095591	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.176517407833	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.396068400558	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.0752435974941	We're running.
0.0	0.248379283835	If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen.
0.0	0.409971362245	It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
0.0	0.174726808386	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.42047088797	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.368216193834	I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path.
0.0	0.430733351035	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.484963729103	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.411141170913	But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.
0.0	0.030798628276	You are not our adversary, you are our partner.
0.0	0.363005547944	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.436591867884	We defended the highest median income in the country.
0.0	0.207063184979	May I have a chance to respond to this issue?
0.0	0.402414492552	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.464979819149	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.270729729794	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.
0.0	0.219734727992	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.061973733281	That is not right.
0.0	0.341984624306	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.576399865706	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.249622186703	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.421067496953	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.412746107843	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.301870612226	The CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary.
0.0	0.215632279198	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.0597592923544	I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.344337625956	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.14755080371	What is the best way to do it?
0.0	0.168456699208	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.459425789936	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.0317285179932	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.136278498459	Let me just...
0.0	0.186380095281	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...
0.0	0.158002967727	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
0.0	0.5	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.20255714117	We're rebuilding many countries.
0.0	0.256476148924	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.20417642266	I'm not using the lobbyists.
0.0	0.335130901952	I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.
0.0	0.31876765082	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.261104604554	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.391310207622	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.260380046151	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.443043998537	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
0.0	0.191851787367	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.224197685272	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.13572487845	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.42343249472	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.139487096923	Our country is in crisis.
0.0	0.105564735406	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.303831776425	In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.0741582927188	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.0714060883695	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.298089077558	And for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.
0.0	0.0739672277869	Yes.
0.0	0.233853385928	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.178252139585	I know that because I buy the product."
0.0	0.0482273912954	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.399985515953	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.293220573594	And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.
0.0	0.140315708383	I'll keep -- I'll keep heading in that direction, believe me.
0.0	0.5	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.381715225419	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.
0.0	0.322378747716	We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.
0.0	0.293897472029	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
