0.0	0.0	And you know what?
1.0	0.985546309367	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.196915939927	OK?
0.0	0.362240246227	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.113164230496	And guess what?
0.0	0.307645667877	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.311135172584	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.496581474839	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.237713976668	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.326268762737	Well, I did.
0.0	0.470755566248	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.360602388946	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.358907769154	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.59219780033	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.522311702253	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.446381942448	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.474373437622	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.496084922699	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.320431727253	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.413798663195	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.169738324601	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.258953143263	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.347599661739	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.455981814246	You count on it.
0.0	0.215823560828	They're off to China.
0.0	0.355586739561	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.355399813413	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.344643248866	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.407045042774	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.427786461572	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.44543268242	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.513235668496	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.389672186856	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.0	We do.
0.0	0.397188676928	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.237816267629	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.418839165178	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.678102054861	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.235917529726	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.213968140289	We're running.
0.0	0.396350611744	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.47289680765	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.270638935108	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.324552182703	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.334933841386	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.348432435584	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.0	I was not at all.
0.0	0.309210093768	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.337633777296	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.368561435409	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.404716836378	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.229676679315	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.396228059451	I changed that.
0.0	0.487738773723	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.465877639088	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.

0.0	0.408251144416	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.683005115707	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.424039664345	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.221527959442	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.394814307064	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.338179123612	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.431181764098	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.427537199794	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.413224358013	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.43616353737	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.287954969121	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.485941891005	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.362123535013	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.218451637109	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.466443054032	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.380694743028	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.387275846982	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
1.0	0.577021429333	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.402864086949	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.369450988977	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.271528768217	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.196915939927	OK.
0.0	0.260338842257	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.436662679036	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.220047720573	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.387733231433	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.164112662735	You're right.
0.0	0.497479304191	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.314523920943	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.567194987578	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.259498302753	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.351366545521	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.212840453991	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.601144592591	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.250065655357	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.25630282337	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.318579692147	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.278188962958	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.170107140712	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.429299752674	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.64685987665	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.442611010121	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.322207623498	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.260481623975	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.363751166576	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.26121741562	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.417529098264	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.229508896409	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.155441060036	That's what we need.
0.0	0.598872448752	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.267223426191	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
1.0	0.405141936683	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.365443495114	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.379424216946	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.446325829372	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.187527217827	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.330259365768	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.388074524746	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.643920070781	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.314813244514	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.219027545006	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.456966433235	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.52431033033	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.340602130212	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.1373065818	You can have him.
0.0	0.219079101646	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.397071885613	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.374394519231	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.354857663125	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.286053744888	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.260591262661	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.371142245162	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.450598141141	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.256795542072	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.148947900243	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.48156567486	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.603933282238	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.562140410247	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.287407228805	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.36552406299	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.387227944679	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.364362469449	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.351664626704	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.421127563589	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.243126285671	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.480487728683	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.278351363397	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.174120809583	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.416810582338	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.406208378111	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.236733615694	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.481351747777	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.394782425727	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.341646360298	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.497339457442	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.472955085581	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.406869079978	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.249314445496	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.393820662416	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.189708620749	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.38584227352	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.378246754654	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.446340437167	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.427583833088	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
1.0	0.830762976177	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.566789389149	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.461348363737	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.389167094556	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.277421930612	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.237346291082	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.413941677892	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.405563322096	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.373659011619	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.615566902143	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.375941188224	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.326781797066	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.39041180939	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.267785172882	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.523172457245	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.262719897629	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.406468788453	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.538874590145	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.263250708992	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.406118681814	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.238960742036	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.234999758317	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.615511634356	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.423893821155	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.309949975018	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.561594191557	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.382278265954	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.360460847213	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.396282753516	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.295115387877	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.406776100178	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.379144441051	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.347917580153	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.334257093204	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.666031005485	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.372482130845	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.240533773097	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.669421295455	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.523577330108	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.

0.0	0.176739766179	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.365910023501	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.367668326709	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.365474468435	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.477095409766	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.286434727811	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.39336649635	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.153121409503	I like it.
0.0	0.561577050887	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.49358910074	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.0	Check it out.
0.0	0.521451360909	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.221110705045	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.428277812288	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.567950899621	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.301970042369	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.281829789661	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.286880135167	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.511487425191	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.214512982689	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.366794404938	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.508767596858	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.196995688106	We need a doer, not a talker.
1.0	0.952604485707	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.184213706021	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.326550038254	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.30801896753	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.337643232783	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.391063525569	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.344180358563	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.522007760254	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.283165577548	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.498607001703	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.55574857833	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.453056293852	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.474547640104	That's my bill.
0.0	0.301659809246	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.297105844319	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.380306840785	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.415056906602	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.521822513081	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.308448873534	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.336969970264	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.228075040709	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.354001802758	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
1.0	0.573602003956	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.227146512293	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.0	We haven't.
0.0	0.255583928077	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.425210116102	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.305819155041	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.517453564954	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.401082092043	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.493657738842	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.328183383529	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.363808271439	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.22976753678	Ever.
0.0	0.148058236238	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.254674944339	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.367990558051	Now, let me just be clear, John.
1.0	0.41436176669	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.445119980168	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.0	No -- no...
0.0	0.455403746537	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.350016615894	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.376224486388	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.580266677941	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.414872840683	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.291969640957	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.545504206574	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.278141451971	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.461268387443	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.313287764191	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.419468139283	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.325683073043	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.322515792711	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.210340490623	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.331451284504	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.333635969847	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.470615413944	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.204976087279	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.31237788007	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.274560056083	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.356251598092	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.479430256662	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.477747453746	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.525029312492	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.315446191983	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.329352579988	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.31938114488	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.507485643519	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.376042835859	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.359763380565	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.420318034638	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.362899739422	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.507727133924	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.311034486334	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.369110423674	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.280370187697	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.14326893871	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.516138535641	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.335699626686	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
1.0	0.963584566464	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.568974614487	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.291590618527	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.355331509675	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.276384312051	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.472578689211	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.509770348244	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.557350122669	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.356539014485	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.536864884647	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.303605569347	Neil...
0.0	0.338957085109	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.440147532767	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.419121600585	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.351575319018	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.47249068325	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.308306927263	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.384655372927	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.170363916705	Here's the thing.
1.0	0.737649114776	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.262403655067	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.295335337891	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.260461956719	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.418394033231	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.419101011949	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.353361638818	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.395753461272	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.365700646996	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.381346457537	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.425653895946	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.334596876936	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.316704096707	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.243776194837	I got that.
0.0	0.291969640957	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.220612111835	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.337938859432	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.420038253713	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
1.0	0.906712233467	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
1.0	0.409258718188	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.486256683931	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.385425346929	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.289685343609	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.200628776987	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.253548852849	You bet they do.
0.0	0.472736455656	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.444148162535	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.112143596069	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.361303061215	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.399404275119	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.400752587705	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.454467609935	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.182752853585	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.352679813523	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.652170104193	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.370721175372	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.502648680907	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.296517197718	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.272115377386	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.541793068892	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.504925165783	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.406144611814	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.386620663305	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.318872626863	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.363804090699	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.40379747535	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.317527467469	They don't like that.
0.0	0.0	How about this?
0.0	0.315195063894	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.414742490457	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.395986431496	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.289875162063	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.37474013819	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.396382533931	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.220475457113	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.389805492878	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.37422764611	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.265221238255	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.369624263295	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.43888660816	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.2302448351	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.33721555203	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.355363743179	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.316283600193	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.390893875539	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.237790656562	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.240546802743	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.272059739702	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.393096863134	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.433968759842	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.348762580807	A lot of people have jumped in here.
1.0	0.962705190314	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.278351363397	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.317219322032	It's not working.
0.0	0.221879919741	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.318429902466	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.476672037903	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.440357602419	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.292943261705	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.383080318135	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.503701876876	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.203280888413	Well, sure.
1.0	0.41928415311	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.14668349355	It never happens.
0.0	0.444984344973	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.405984230063	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.342801529341	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.422529644475	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.139944781653	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.361212368729	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.2405161919	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.209393568727	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.383230178252	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.280012807044	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.0	It is.
0.0	0.35679237557	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.431785522153	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.0	That's what he is.
0.0	0.375195060338	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.456562285655	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.3926857304	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.193943341147	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.454848533622	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.516655554327	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.370680412164	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.203269092515	We need security.
0.0	0.372804025144	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.419414420674	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.453037865179	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.411180125723	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.217752406099	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.408607105073	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.309193260771	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.364337223477	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.38149994254	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.444126196226	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.407943881157	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.285769994976	...Chris...
0.0	0.470767870903	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.275613884634	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.378161955232	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.612480068857	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.505153365894	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.677013181302	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.387211447437	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.363508547433	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.476880106484	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.411708170783	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.160642962104	Yeah.
0.0	0.211445038884	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.43157359823	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.54761300883	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.210909772833	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.526473826906	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.568012554736	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.312291337692	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.545726617017	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.310345716126	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.286555896877	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.390240525297	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.311910635649	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.211330198837	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.444542143299	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.371032004338	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.392185494949	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
1.0	0.992837863215	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.275239971256	That's what I said.
0.0	0.273947381101	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.360012032608	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.267889083708	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.357992469257	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.293819037398	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.491501217272	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.386119856626	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.653283973518	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.378570663425	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.744166047254	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
1.0	0.404683848762	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.371345475489	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.399294063999	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.523915854238	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.503249807467	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.526734966367	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.423588798133	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.415896058986	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.355513111177	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
0.0	0.396342933367	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.362911139586	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.35470591116	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.409089593045	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.347759769981	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.244774982963	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.379241001111	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.362073629661	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.386696088849	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.361401367314	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.422221206359	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.289449804252	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.439517251106	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.479074308482	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.284452441854	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.374209487218	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.382527275749	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.270931574406	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.420284883454	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.235244572252	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.394681225074	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.46989852549	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.481689965842	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.359150326297	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.314195317538	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.313025809763	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.277499442289	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.423179583763	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.256667922964	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.245415478712	It's a joke.
0.0	0.436459714721	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.254554572248	Good at email.
0.0	0.218623179369	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	1.0	I never said that.
0.0	0.434841983493	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
1.0	0.97707962425	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.204854147744	I promise.
0.0	0.562008057954	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.427784317223	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.398197889208	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.271581164312	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.436913452188	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.251638214908	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.415949798949	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.323929814259	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.279309228734	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.0	Wait for what?
0.0	0.366113669475	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.352091347846	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.212782287136	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.329416163711	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.357183967352	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.286923577227	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.256168261662	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.434872225019	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.35185469607	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
1.0	0.985030192261	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.618427764764	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.261054269117	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.471971012588	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.12307703707	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.359160514965	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.309664034949	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.203063454156	No, that's -- you're wrong.
1.0	0.781789167326	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.373612123285	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.485760197953	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.400745885708	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.136209203575	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.360777096826	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.240918535663	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.279778423934	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.30289172322	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
1.0	0.721128071789	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.380896245349	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.357670070897	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.345116969426	About Medicare?
0.0	0.264083653437	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.36879076752	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.27489901407	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.78261199594	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.283200172326	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.296339261732	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.0	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.378566002082	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.351266091674	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.228497999155	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.186529343709	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.274634467232	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.560520068985	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.289781082483	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.338453621792	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.481540192705	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.287136483571	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.348959190347	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.373569744553	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.625055548941	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
1.0	0.532501969723	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.221338788857	No vision at all.
0.0	0.377854898344	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.359807534568	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.

0.0	0.44312910193	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.380625474949	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.

0.0	0.205249285532	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.493972542934	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.237771615516	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.360677785562	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
1.0	0.399589521743	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.187373431599	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.547762249488	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.345224128014	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
1.0	0.916351659757	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.450203624462	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.315338144028	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.293999794421	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.326947368377	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.371192881998	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.194016901089	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.22129728554	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.398562993824	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.436488534417	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.638590978921	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.

0.0	0.356474172925	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.454682473825	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.239750106215	Do we have answer for that?
1.0	0.628760168886	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.345632681896	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.454756075567	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.314600139566	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.

0.0	0.310658214088	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.510216018673	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.171289949233	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.309225549791	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.204388307316	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.344750939403	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.24971163486	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.44717520006	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.686993136538	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.292898491718	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.331329331183	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.6216752586	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.404607576108	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.351740261847	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.308852427497	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.385129677376	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.715820160676	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.343290192652	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.233560634912	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.171289949233	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.427263853284	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.169336721654	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.520759595809	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.505131969306	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.352469436896	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.271409419255	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.184081870293	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.497587284385	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.264475620027	I would change them.
0.0	0.300325651546	John.
0.0	0.196457040145	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.437851782365	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.515419629896	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.264135376581	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.264891516522	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.386367541892	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.539181952208	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.425000216349	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.344596644379	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.294516530995	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.285523187271	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.287138708264	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.388352479384	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.183370847993	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.36449206699	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.227864527598	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.501469670865	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.240379065374	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.183197558462	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.323494989547	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.393402372141	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.221274505017	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.21541422353	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.25674188663	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.624926379362	Two points.
0.0	0.403121000231	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.310423277414	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.185686906981	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.237620084194	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.169976038762	Okay.
0.0	0.328362413089	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.56532472845	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.344918582747	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.504341177746	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.449396401042	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.309586395677	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.384275119858	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.267022016611	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
1.0	0.954687393398	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.313109551925	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.346928906783	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.244611622233	I would just say that...
0.0	0.416920799358	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.399714919487	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.204698244763	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.554256178326	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.

0.0	0.4880752452	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.355562688983	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.

0.0	0.271864600547	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.246154652788	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.372144267763	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.542609349087	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.341619241749	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.36670769208	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.329540742276	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.486694744266	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.181618696329	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.450282626658	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.496773476162	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.

0.0	0.450503778156	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.374036312128	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.374792254766	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.342715894234	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.2051655694	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.357783612262	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.217451694925	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.457682400199	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.449780605041	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.

0.0	0.326090228593	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
1.0	0.900268344419	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.293229915552	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.336569813848	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.231424748244	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.328834059335	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.304209795203	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.210998687973	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.487639997776	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.0	And...
1.0	0.874110453182	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.400597688654	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.236982472671	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.417743701834	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.583392421428	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.562588992898	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.431796209762	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.390758713981	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.45330563784	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.0	I'll say this.
0.0	0.280443661548	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.332192009919	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.376242945836	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
1.0	0.287082324974	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.15553655522	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.387464924526	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.170295055568	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.432349326767	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.303705577037	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.35074815469	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.382415339518	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.428401675486	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.40809262842	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.350432393496	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.0	We were wrong.
0.0	0.702512039497	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.385611263605	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.355340138044	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.420028969559	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.362388159587	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.411619857986	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.409975893166	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.35472988694	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.483397741504	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.317527467469	I don't like that.
0.0	0.380557816825	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.328713537509	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.214497382144	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.22424239707	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.303609705863	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.48276990677	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.217267863873	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.438576019966	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.336705138001	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.304782558499	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.597272122824	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.527777104139	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.348949756654	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.526374748124	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.343846516991	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.378273904866	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.25014443352	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.411464557412	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.372264168893	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.665976802751	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.346519987013	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.168362187285	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.387474733877	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.47755750363	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.331476834628	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.38095007036	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.429016478166	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
1.0	0.549144222489	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.313125894213	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.284896845801	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.183606891234	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.505534645686	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.360797765682	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.34734170757	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.0	I have.
0.0	0.308289827726	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.3300767067	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.436591493443	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.461307579697	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.455639250298	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.457325173285	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.316022177125	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.385377978945	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.163759308286	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.390130277252	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.684647787367	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.383442624215	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.139994030186	I think you're --
0.0	0.454859324212	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.314242944901	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.340100138199	But I was born here.
0.0	0.488534476488	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.287802603587	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.379902694478	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.434145998121	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.346089366678	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.640760109838	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.309562834163	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.27564097974	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.489274348521	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.120796006855	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.180760880942	We'll just clean it up.

0.0	0.271321144702	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.400284260181	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.444863798388	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.437425024979	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.285740502398	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.381006268684	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.376456110052	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.168142962743	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.190072472836	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.253327890823	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.330847833483	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.389685812218	He was on the board.
0.0	0.177527584551	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.361638763042	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.354455062457	Dynamically.
0.0	0.366985211686	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.609611095012	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.26999385218	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.676854012596	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.456505522408	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.218757215608	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.548310330298	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.316530668185	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.488550524422	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.413115291821	White people?
0.0	0.560748828941	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.4681515855	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.461818120481	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.218736561086	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.221662205902	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.325100091732	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.177846691342	...No, sir...
0.0	0.160126297037	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.366356573572	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
1.0	0.94904427245	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.328349243143	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.360479277323	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.471483396999	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.128950536146	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.315784192398	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.55676212182	The number of women --
0.0	0.177750360663	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.521033032287	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.460625821441	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.427957614679	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.440679511657	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.0	You know why?
0.0	0.552264464592	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.0	That is important.
0.0	0.303282530235	That's the difference.
0.0	0.0971053324329	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.271311542375	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.246444934941	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.427637664777	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.576689729101	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.327953703117	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
1.0	0.955010833876	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.514983002874	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.385711457842	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.45411264734	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.372956460633	Both served.
0.0	0.295795455218	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.473103844308	You do legislation.
0.0	0.476801121608	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.351013637446	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.379074375335	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.40971217398	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.377774087373	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.26340063725	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.275310527043	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.258589181508	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.408201529824	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.388636753477	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.249125450338	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.308448873534	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.364720120542	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.284910002764	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.415369734039	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.461312100318	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.612639550258	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.253385406447	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.333749368195	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.181771741091	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.413678877015	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.490918657318	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.232557780765	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.376311176869	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.567516293423	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.2927736557	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.308243514779	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.330617694313	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.358623454886	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.377484262852	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.180620191327	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.398095674242	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.200460623242	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.584800764887	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.320163270326	You know why three?
0.0	0.452668148093	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.186421343667	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.359866903123	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.181710180771	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.127285916567	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.36269367345	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.278877086847	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
1.0	0.447804038223	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.355133967758	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.354149573573	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.379639347901	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.399509815415	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.305378823301	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.32308715356	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.419720706433	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
1.0	0.528390449144	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.47314799824	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.121776468455	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.216595456468	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.295723114885	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.389725547037	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.378665798733	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.462548965484	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.295021948431	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.634528070254	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.470853259022	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.397007998444	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.410410623199	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.475482046537	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.355104004987	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.418279408819	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
1.0	0.913158202081	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.256056196988	Big difference.
0.0	0.470755566248	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.351094558291	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.3510346504	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.798560775876	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.537936160215	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.564937368248	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.179071135039	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.531988858829	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.71244578862	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.580266677941	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.429951110628	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
1.0	0.814739213246	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.410259261399	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.310782668202	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.295410465191	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.504304692581	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.563393776526	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.362440141387	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.272379778214	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.409234358549	That's not the role of the government.
1.0	0.596435269933	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.329768615397	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.596456351234	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.452037894713	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.313465883602	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.310268615211	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.3232682585	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.45100461592	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.438478286493	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.420559191219	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.392747879392	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.316545866504	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.316924612963	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.460361277422	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.413902591519	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.423770937689	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.311522288565	Maria...
0.0	0.26318918259	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.439499560855	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.469883796731	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.305241759061	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.406876777719	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.326023278512	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.455619480046	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.425668898269	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.278827954971	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.515136759073	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.364577889558	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.260290204535	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
1.0	0.80253791389	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.24602749973	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.539152559269	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.297829821649	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.262804874799	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.418539613574	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.264083653437	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.490302663767	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.141543995799	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.403121837506	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.236219747432	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.500242785866	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.327491160381	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.590373760694	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.262446630774	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.451960398718	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.178336419064	Alright.
0.0	0.337267993091	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.236982472671	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.413510090906	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.715820160676	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.255835134543	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.382792133879	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.474942840023	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.323001786448	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.0	And here's why.
0.0	0.268845354393	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.757639590656	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.230903286004	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.309912553281	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.349961759661	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.229367111855	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.458546118818	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.464561529241	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.306151164684	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.389065341071	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.164364843245	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.193115944592	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.304750921149	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.0	I will do that.
0.0	0.420284883454	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.355859087857	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.447196187736	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.634220176478	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.205033706532	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.341804612283	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.394639956961	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.349681037648	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.276644853446	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.393959039412	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.293460526914	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.63268149503	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.456629859938	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.29668686298	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.169598743815	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.498980531511	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.356175950002	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.394456752805	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.202817711211	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.627942500459	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.376858802119	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.296860646193	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.772201331786	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.280069235568	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.243580603502	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.279711485883	And we are not England.
0.0	0.235385512406	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.347002266586	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.150635517386	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.420278186288	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.432868335507	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.295498299657	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.436192980835	A brief response.
0.0	0.35100914807	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.310994872358	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.460936932098	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.410658572664	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.34167072402	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.455304798321	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.410286424223	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.509965533273	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.41916656421	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.570635191399	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.425117062858	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.315005386385	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.278788635734	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.420055779002	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.29396314075	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.282261561513	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.557223813545	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.301258711537	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.345638936132	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.36488778606	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
1.0	0.861737922241	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.591242819034	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.419235567057	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.394753287095	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.0	He's wrong.
0.0	0.692889952783	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.265036969136	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.363632575157	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.403203637287	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.246637980837	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.535283906966	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.387925244389	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.343293910149	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	1.0	I never said that.
0.0	0.376298159001	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.415099457834	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.0	Again...
0.0	0.286887360279	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.409065298656	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.394802545839	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.389370163101	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.360546123388	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.338396142294	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.506728364866	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.312545913417	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.481429941644	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.314412960649	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.23040539861	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.499463600015	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.457520979272	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.290681399598	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.30755866908	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.223039837492	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.455826997864	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.219007172371	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.491160583951	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.245090234134	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.358686846585	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.319718726485	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.305082874434	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.311763750636	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.304051612757	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.178299521251	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.310952022844	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.511319546417	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.367167074314	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.445789701181	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.275409240538	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.1373065818	I can.
0.0	0.382593621937	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.578402572789	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.402468678324	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.23933739242	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.337373021861	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.43560033945	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.471536718501	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.284373668565	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.254230310251	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
1.0	0.870390097832	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.34485880565	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.252136404692	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.59875357271	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.331897552524	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.262599684532	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.22174777187	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.445530870434	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.466368540773	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.638181363658	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.33482670742	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.417684245221	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.742128972923	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.169761936051	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.435092777793	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.432711262322	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.439167193482	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.451725943147	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.648501641076	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.438083913122	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.412805070334	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.616259925242	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.225588714096	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.495156352701	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.320861158928	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.394681885682	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.496642660612	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.34251422293	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.417997687354	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.548131629174	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.545835561692	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.367323112312	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.310623747989	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.368734262051	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.496560034798	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.130523248991	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.552043033559	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.309707781522	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.393711331597	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.261208928511	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.23348500523	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.305279092244	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.466012727276	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.321012802599	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.436804571727	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.310629693086	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.452120828891	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.19485713527	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.311430799054	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.382992030319	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.27732314497	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.315084910351	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.534128864235	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.25857441166	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.539208997154	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.193159489117	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.322678185234	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.666771517537	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.57404799363	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.118247652065	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.225150647981	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.367097429799	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.372960661708	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.258077282704	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.365627679075	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.309634395364	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.345555707173	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.188898096543	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.460168287641	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.277932409045	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.341442413617	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.338635930837	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.471053413461	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.421211704956	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.421210055331	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.303135412637	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
1.0	0.803394742201	That's wrong.
0.0	0.243507877133	I'm tested.
0.0	0.3975438209	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.

0.0	0.291044769651	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.356512881253	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.465019858868	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.15953621181	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.296227299712	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.398859715898	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.321391957994	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.422078811427	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.365406097612	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.332778656396	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.

0.0	0.284311161248	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.340501961104	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.373174658793	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.297055116507	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.179191408133	How great is that?
0.0	0.227976588799	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.380762232238	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.418887643922	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.618938671464	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.397067918857	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.326597511278	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.301688327553	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
1.0	0.81702103374	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.438210974791	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.168373217088	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.340307445518	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.3726095368	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.543817268097	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.560099035326	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.437851280286	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.194529796574	OK, good.
0.0	0.231993291174	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.142335155637	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.212169049336	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.466400140941	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.346423539952	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.346519987013	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.38492281152	They cause dishonesty.

0.0	0.43827588891	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.368517647123	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.249553081198	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.173091929119	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.549029403225	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.419302447491	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.289432542355	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.40466319	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.303665974878	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.

0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.360009682819	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.412652932264	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.139845595167	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.40865169863	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.27087980169	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.348928561486	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.414538483687	I had to borrow money to go to school.

0.0	0.284813281684	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.526681008661	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.363173941341	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.287173036943	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.460465747279	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.472145686182	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.169758393961	...before I go.
0.0	0.427188233957	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.388636753477	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.358560986573	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.341879980615	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.250064928666	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.297637524559	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.401910870899	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.618143119547	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.398417584656	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.277924753225	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.290381749337	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.35577398448	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
1.0	0.566473223481	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.257684419187	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.335266684017	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.429739932128	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.344966128913	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.220273871105	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.406148567697	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.504293082939	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.158027229961	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.178616857962	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.363163470717	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.271163503305	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.40420855587	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.384809733758	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.259775232884	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.348882068078	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.407953596866	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.246621712448	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.454496349467	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.364826418338	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.413992775861	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.398840519134	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.2990394256	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.504375972989	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
1.0	0.961424987883	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.655091387953	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.367513311183	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.530163524252	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.477021132566	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.258607306651	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.328482019348	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.137760578871	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.297167955219	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
1.0	0.570567222015	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.644581206893	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.451355285528	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.470776112429	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.23092745312	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.406232793048	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.

0.0	0.357740311924	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.451942071034	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.344874879935	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.524186944242	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
1.0	0.92714607914	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.483100471848	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.0	You don't have to.
0.0	0.325716336077	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.546588504361	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.43828991709	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.334194383944	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.37422764611	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.434647975069	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.203352787024	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.249947589661	They're Muslim.

0.0	0.350391326658	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.396372333184	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.129221844916	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.282274084141	That never works.
0.0	0.268542228953	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.565052128466	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.251937559501	What's crony capitalism?
1.0	0.889164681328	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.301592935016	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.398229493008	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.534168209951	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.358425453336	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.307578344968	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.455225537205	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.

0.0	0.338063861447	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.450264298894	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.318250863074	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.287296211121	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.299003455151	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.56041704012	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.293902990513	Not bad.
0.0	0.230790810252	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.441066516808	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.145934658589	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.550572633238	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.503097241668	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.302223541292	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.307070738538	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.473653732925	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.377558953697	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.336472180672	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.364867480143	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.348572122034	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.305956206575	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.218972101524	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.166384265365	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.164110110215	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.382343464616	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
1.0	0.827898037801	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.52307808828	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.

0.0	0.423277555842	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.330775495237	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.364993631163	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.361646139155	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.186569178459	That's what I've always stood for.

0.0	0.289197883682	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.270634916367	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.530496858025	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.286227562785	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.340268099369	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.258361032988	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.567037048295	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.320445265316	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.1373065818	I can do that.
0.0	0.482297776764	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.292669239921	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.16024770784	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.148606281639	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.418807407789	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.388702302571	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.460837300857	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.358590322074	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.339909998471	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.311682603806	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.507562298933	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.

0.0	0.318393788483	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.173454197695	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.441331262879	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.32524544895	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.411412148822	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.280069235568	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
1.0	0.754097429411	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.323695976132	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.441471732551	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.359409576787	My background is different.
0.0	0.310304314117	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.

0.0	0.321949672447	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.164418666465	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.356247793802	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.343139681828	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.267291328643	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.

0.0	0.68841682502	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.701080801016	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.363701962552	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.213968140289	We're running.

0.0	0.549196767739	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.322280941494	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.196915939927	OK?
0.0	0.177865755859	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.299053820302	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.339622856412	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.360404921633	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.403032408472	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.362997084786	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.164112662735	You're right.
0.0	0.584300978661	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.173454197695	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.405174791286	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.439281869357	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.393884027314	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.219306601767	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
1.0	0.633046649471	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.0958719709711	See?
0.0	0.278180409455	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.419885333405	The economy was really booming.

0.0	0.517624300351	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.494278511882	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.281038865007	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.359098059076	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.326988941896	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.268536903949	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.349052996677	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.30470292392	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.7345786736	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.191523215666	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.440479484008	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.401496834559	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.171358645351	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.425129831264	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.344300842195	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.422721646659	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.289942529481	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.429426636813	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.316975285425	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.519208556841	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.276469756023	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.275073991193	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
1.0	0.656647593969	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.497415222957	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.384023409874	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.515014603199	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.369127506368	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.326119595311	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.430503358758	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.597947330192	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.137041339408	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.286714538776	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.481789595213	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.242661977182	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.351953078328	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.379038177293	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.17313951949	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.244881663473	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.273465087277	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.193853002279	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.362452852151	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.313904245622	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.398896698598	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.311753510765	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.337245758104	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.0	You do.
0.0	0.397260856861	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.434259197098	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.371256941359	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.326542293813	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.328242568338	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.255980756081	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.37733185074	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.0	So you know what?
0.0	0.317926398792	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.328839953485	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.541336865756	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.324288056757	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.338002980579	He undermines it.
0.0	0.390089129178	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.258395144471	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.41353316084	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.324776663425	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.385934762871	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.334342065869	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.359968037981	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.341349967756	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.315652270214	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.589436871898	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.430009905578	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.359674950003	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.334089273444	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.303919984998	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.360499984383	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.414397723751	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.339481954528	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.421994660853	He has never defended...
0.0	0.39913464982	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.224156741087	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.194969654468	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.345203000137	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
1.0	0.866932711481	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.256621518155	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.578456120346	Just for the record.
0.0	0.268285918829	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.412300890493	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
1.0	0.476704303837	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.243545993919	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.410650966461	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
1.0	0.928362210615	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.394785803205	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.280399961062	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.442123604533	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.315683411161	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.305848385343	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.382481243345	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.353075549294	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.35372678812	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.366820181711	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.504767231331	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.30363133912	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.311637503053	And our economy was growing like crazy.

0.0	0.403084173167	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.346543310359	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.347019562897	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.505717889141	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.316072483352	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.262402928636	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.357764725981	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.324907946461	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.609214979656	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.196915939927	OK?

0.0	0.271594117687	Divide that out.
0.0	0.368743182028	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.371653856757	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.38062158884	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.360641123761	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.210867260405	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.410823952203	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.477229742022	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.230415372641	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.268345987572	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.177423047225	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.288535419979	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.40191764182	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.331077137003	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.353536324847	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.399536010411	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.337311260293	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.373643350192	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.204368139869	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.308067488241	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.185462082821	I totally get that.
0.0	0.182695860893	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.353023416469	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.360958740513	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.393397284638	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.370706547277	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.532046969085	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.362118840388	In all due respect...
0.0	0.34286998858	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.403585327756	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.35245106608	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.311299009506	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.335638683532	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.380971467176	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.685287426756	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.358543944101	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.506512564154	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.357283084833	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.529544554768	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.44843793577	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.640930759499	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.392951967848	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.328065377079	We don't win.
0.0	0.302850567265	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.325410468322	And for good cause.
0.0	0.298991361388	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.370623962348	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.373481439538	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.228531431676	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.261540816038	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.339748783442	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.502117419172	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.384834972686	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.33742907895	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.493138810969	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.487810001352	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.0	She voted for it.
0.0	0.345546037387	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.0	They know.
0.0	0.473669053572	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.516135047389	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.17113513854	You find me...
0.0	0.438498868492	Illegal.
0.0	0.366349536235	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.454472346837	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.422877401127	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.296323982258	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.420492352822	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.350767557472	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.444126085837	That's fine.
0.0	0.434377297681	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.341106356585	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.496542200584	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.358411385477	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.381407750443	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.367905318471	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
1.0	0.113314186722	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.356852798577	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
1.0	0.735310570878	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.557653608238	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	1.0	That's not true.
0.0	0.394760860836	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.402458599138	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.372516356975	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.350246808199	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
1.0	0.361216233785	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.261622270415	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.662330080383	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.209714012521	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.425680013303	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.305068570377	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.137717196156	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.429998956979	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.292851096981	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.377918934446	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.351286404961	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.465732438168	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.476605084745	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.45325527594	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.236867496974	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.221243222166	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.284663444299	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.346671139005	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.522187973666	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.312439054995	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.582636345088	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.0977156861823	Think about that.
0.0	0.174503317716	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.492488002352	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.312098366969	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.211778014958	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.0	They were wrong.
0.0	0.374933392378	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.376408748311	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.34796799553	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.498985730641	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.372510944279	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.410108449543	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.374897831833	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.301026235898	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.179191408133	He does great.
0.0	0.377946149724	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.279201884134	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.414054891433	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.386856586307	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.417131473933	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.57850339847	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.208409962651	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.253135254507	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.0	That's right.
0.0	0.262203116225	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.270543918022	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.211432006699	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.429426636813	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.457022145419	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.388452269643	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.321111338879	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.340730532482	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.640511853672	...income tax...
0.0	0.155441060036	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.220732045053	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	1.0	Of course not.
0.0	0.330485488094	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.394150766815	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.152307318855	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.148104209497	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.352822518899	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.57078275337	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.557955712376	It's their money.
0.0	0.446622528959	The world has changed.
0.0	0.0	He's wrong.
0.0	0.412759217175	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.433547991576	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.328695196619	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.270597089417	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.452990787155	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.576351914163	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.530496858025	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.279643173659	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.429384741908	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.435591383379	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.527884187186	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.29745073928	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.45910499136	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.553521948212	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.482277391836	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.289239127881	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.378284011449	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.354296609711	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	1.0	I never said that.
0.0	0.33387949396	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.339998090698	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.298040630385	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.379089081225	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.296237091446	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.350610003545	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.450879175161	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.234908232874	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.332695374545	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.453282208349	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.303313748887	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.37759269865	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.298746740739	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.104256585937	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.354865169554	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.407038817521	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.281805763066	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
0.0	0.680115824541	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.56226131655	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.336659565224	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.364506737313	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.34177357953	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.499530426303	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.314483246995	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.204412508887	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.161915744291	It feels different.
0.0	0.539665788659	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.474438471327	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.304296354192	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.419298611379	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.401384322074	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.555869654402	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.252190859279	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.0	That is not right.
0.0	0.202583473272	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.343911055051	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.409860200731	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.364498084755	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.246801718974	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.367613743019	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.196028150046	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.34841308416	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.537035679097	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.137636757192	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.558162155269	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.473214363679	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.178605051029	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.328050443241	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.0977156861823	Think about it.
0.0	0.22647392597	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.302799826059	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.2497481145	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.443869909172	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.415902808988	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.553451741085	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
1.0	0.551612221716	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.0	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.296895405162	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.160170776211	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.349264607467	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.588771924624	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.170694568291	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.362635754902	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.261581047094	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.425653895946	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.508836404126	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
1.0	0.915588905603	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.430152874339	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.247726359401	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.228138639143	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.439507332067	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.269288404725	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.353746975036	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.678102079088	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.414193923271	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.295881651562	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.460225799177	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.368733180235	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.39706456756	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.286119642631	I know every one.
0.0	0.3337655884	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.208148670311	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.37351016483	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.338885842037	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.246978049108	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.0	You did.
0.0	0.0	They didn't do that.
0.0	1.0	It's true.
0.0	0.577569425339	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.370047443331	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.399597697163	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.335594782095	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.377651380526	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.219372971276	Can we stop?
0.0	0.115406912294	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.322640328786	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.359390803575	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.204217032072	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.344254301165	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.441323183837	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.290964744441	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.275259216425	I was the architect.
0.0	0.500910999137	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.252784573855	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.187465339616	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.373428854664	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.219958611324	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.0	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.515910443321	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.387948562548	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.432400861882	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.450637337437	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.245665307225	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.369981045568	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.343230603031	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.520141105085	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.440038854041	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.183199631949	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.307080526909	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.465878519922	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.236498978764	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.624476154191	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.18966446379	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.467992459101	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.363988594671	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.366843060246	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.354403796795	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.269291068722	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.177048497361	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.396890823881	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.291572839355	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.

0.0	0.365857076693	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.476853588763	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.39448134128	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.160531776678	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.439339557115	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.499250571792	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.

0.0	0.499540955488	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.398565312437	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.618587465035	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.

0.0	0.386238433607	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.

0.0	0.415492148226	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.355256965972	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.0	I didn't.
0.0	0.129190385629	That is what I believe.

0.0	0.225033445733	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.317938619234	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.246094638076	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.328983390717	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.0	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.278409905339	We need Jordan.

0.0	0.2948325217	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.344799420675	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.332227267843	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.260349397063	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.180475987765	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.216878470326	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.

0.0	0.169630465101	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.399387230922	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.

0.0	0.367941867672	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.358711457738	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.376282073645	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.422211010618	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.

0.0	0.398429599354	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.261124207157	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.330895985276	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.287464034244	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.424867282002	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.517654225976	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.385605866178	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.239001095973	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.201454331597	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.511890144437	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.410705788469	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.227230813559	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.380176096016	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.504832054444	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.486294768301	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.468202710602	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.380285186109	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.534531559461	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.422867869716	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.583094165904	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.186001173788	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.272495699948	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.273913077615	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.395165786891	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.278056643034	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.186998352405	So you might not.
0.0	0.0	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.210825265919	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.359393489935	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.372793406823	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.591591869245	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.449460888881	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.344484284311	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.296738282195	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.29994653585	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.633192348006	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.447644850448	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.400519054478	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.500013541293	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.414072977441	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.176503783484	I'm ready.
0.0	0.20541098839	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.311392666182	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.277259354776	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.368219603171	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.292164262175	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.466460076706	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.692079181288	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.343219589069	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.357559126608	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.166996463398	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.404539775342	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.343526114648	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.420243046061	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.321527847321	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.0	You know why?
0.0	0.294205229678	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.40978296945	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.465061416053	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.167462229262	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.377854898344	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.189004525567	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.402119375454	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.495952806744	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.537189474878	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.419131113387	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.356280991818	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.315588745202	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.359791921629	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.512969964599	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.478214898772	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.291064450831	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.685172028311	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.457800747717	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.355447208552	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.489164578897	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.319350863974	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.229627292409	That will change everything.
0.0	0.333799570996	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.0	Why is that?
0.0	0.265734144034	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.320719599672	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.516564308647	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.442347686915	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.202817711211	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.547099491706	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.212457397834	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.300325651546	John?
0.0	0.390423456404	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.377384425131	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.495978594086	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.303808743351	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.446686579731	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.196356094592	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.293951958369	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.532690835957	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.313038979357	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.176842620152	That's what they're doing.
1.0	0.509881498673	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.322691343262	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.351251323516	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.296921339111	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.417351271334	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.0	These...
0.0	0.534640789639	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.501546427622	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.434877527448	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.523940568896	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.267527100273	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.267385817166	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.478056190351	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.396858766994	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.486256683931	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.62826791122	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.40634101177	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.421626294435	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.398891258729	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.284897355936	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.414700157747	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.349167853505	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.496479542268	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.319593858648	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.246137930822	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.471692135819	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.310515894788	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.248091549006	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.502346767809	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.278849932772	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.281432502687	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.500416793522	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
1.0	0.467817785684	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.204412508887	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.469669748963	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.45980514278	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.264475620027	I would change them.
0.0	0.421184823638	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.0	But look...
0.0	0.423345366518	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.480124315974	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.29561945104	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.306023292632	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.429576865399	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.643685188508	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.23092745312	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.275239971256	I said no.
0.0	0.460947696884	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.390615005363	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.362678805518	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.0	That is...
0.0	0.351351608804	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.228538796579	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.0	I have...
0.0	0.345857887074	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.227336844725	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.261433960546	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.292984285806	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.451963748846	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.78262070897	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.343110750664	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.181602816833	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.390049133137	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.359002919525	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.296180103985	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.340799701635	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.170539546979	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.418549849612	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
0.0	0.217501377681	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
1.0	0.348187461785	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.379717071468	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.323984729403	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.218477336693	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.346687336818	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.345224128014	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.430609070806	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.225933365005	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.268144962517	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.262446473764	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.445512090784	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.433538106691	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.424435911728	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.388987374812	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.388228260687	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.342465839302	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.170363916705	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.477961079097	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.0	And so do I.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.516870648319	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.221948816264	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.372878588549	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.222564067835	You looking at me?
0.0	0.446913309852	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.202016361922	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.402005626328	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.434492704425	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.290014578239	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.

0.0	0.394476342586	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.

0.0	0.195702307894	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.448864976698	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.308428199983	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.

1.0	0.346194177124	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.306398415932	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.340971078491	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.261421579988	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.

0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.496075223535	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.539784614308	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.514828307507	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.364034611438	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.170428415528	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.467560408246	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.311874754557	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.370938093195	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.362172841447	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.3809961462	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.346103519455	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.453676920219	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.472089291571	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.364965117685	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.390496596347	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.454874606949	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.348891863625	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.326946969728	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.449927494854	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.361427048363	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.344428847246	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.468285689062	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.65275585259	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
1.0	0.566414990522	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.163674019309	I'm happy to answer the question...
1.0	0.930367992356	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.301847424244	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.550355443273	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.403831376287	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.387198719561	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.196054419759	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.17972684858	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.319579891221	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.471993609001	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.325859169767	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.270566019715	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.208482636532	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.555551753087	You know, I won two record elections.

0.0	0.411109360223	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.379767940115	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.421284980266	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.193255859449	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.296929735268	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.343650374585	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.242180109083	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.313168094702	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.238718807213	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.29947759261	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.338894282279	You really can't.
0.0	0.154452140991	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.412477540566	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.47993507232	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.649992931266	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.219235264207	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.411193750213	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.631453586738	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.454618444862	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.3980066717	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.321821913228	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.499128969741	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.2419477085	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.193414237336	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.294790076205	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.239240008109	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.395642524483	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.530216524553	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.235632096165	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.300969726579	We actually did it.
0.0	0.423132548975	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.48209091545	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.332709517844	I can't do it.
0.0	0.308238492869	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.450993504234	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.257810643118	What have you got now?
0.0	0.242896316051	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.

0.0	0.249259688956	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.518976494055	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.420990303501	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.

1.0	0.915748021551	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.501826756586	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.479758630651	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.159351908483	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.302602209885	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.270005455099	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.445276758557	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.38106035237	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.425828319829	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.289464258999	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.186354217815	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.0	You know that.
1.0	0.411905288041	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.43147240617	This country is changing.

0.0	0.433178549579	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.420649993312	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.249973156753	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.321581123199	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.327650863407	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.320460291435	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.386910896663	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.136516406386	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.336955663341	No accomplishment.

0.0	0.302938348599	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.0	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.456126790327	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.

0.0	0.42736128358	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.

0.0	0.376580380578	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.372264168893	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.404492239645	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.

0.0	0.234220896374	I've laid out...

0.0	0.462552403557	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.35204943609	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.430467516538	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.161972309945	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.450991325803	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.32376565796	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.461866803889	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.243840820403	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.342075121835	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
1.0	0.954218433231	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.363614063449	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.347372137463	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.351932374364	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.506711729981	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.383074479323	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.183779568996	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.32168990706	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.185129416317	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.273206848146	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.499824467498	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.35823284892	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.268674127189	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.355415549937	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.429426636813	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.303988436933	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.219407371233	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.38100250564	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.353870674073	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.575167462706	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.630784364927	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.341048000504	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.384467485379	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.17572691684	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.418433683746	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.549107725758	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.337938859432	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.453882756672	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.265554616841	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.369388229237	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.491653631826	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.268487678175	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.160642962104	Yeah.
0.0	0.306935409404	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.363988594671	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.638433645922	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.377600383525	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
1.0	0.813052744378	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.285780540913	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.296178216073	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.352976525331	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.38492281152	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.665381690124	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.340291847309	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.516551805489	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.194013783207	We're friends.
0.0	0.203525811208	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.369016314248	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.237283355619	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.257562579852	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.402180164709	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
1.0	0.70401500371	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.344363293612	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.23738879584	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.224406057836	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.358126235272	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.318223269034	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.462993502677	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.389928637164	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.484228457586	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.0	But you know what?
0.0	0.456603820461	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.432736688135	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.421365244368	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.430180411255	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.283131778827	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.481488147707	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.411872397044	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.372681250578	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.348174632667	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.384642993261	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.458841019066	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.478821857237	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.276950383083	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.301563749128	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.446860209195	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.345859482409	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.251298380578	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.449432433598	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.489552783807	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.420739091582	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.444881031689	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.405620282574	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.686993136538	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.385439512422	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
1.0	0.871383544234	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.408227048166	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.218404898355	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.59646061049	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.375106074292	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
1.0	0.992960706025	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.395708925309	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.334870428643	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
1.0	0.901515168818	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.552956911154	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.341074555557	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.365721315736	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.409567575113	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.354335680794	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.285769994976	...Chris...
0.0	0.260984914176	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.362433434863	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.281064068769	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.31519132268	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.3646982686	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.396073309865	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
1.0	0.960772063103	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.300325651546	...John...
0.0	0.338651617614	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.254281201349	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.394283879881	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.475496137717	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.399636534643	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.477581301923	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.473682640593	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.325424459031	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.283811724536	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.301727338225	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.328529883007	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
1.0	0.887306259561	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.143026067132	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.255053339512	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.288343918196	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.370625690155	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.429144910611	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.176696198887	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.45178483027	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.401754517827	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.315125304456	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.280796251539	She said the truth.
0.0	0.297758361796	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.459314779881	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.36375739918	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.429426636813	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.573683468357	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.284434098259	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.412646032696	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.497419467106	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.595037936583	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.354498318872	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.34853347705	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.530964564234	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.150185861973	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.369270219714	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.449033208859	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.242805862435	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.539109372834	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.320408043361	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.39013484816	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.423882212483	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.463275901451	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.396331363337	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.414553071226	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.528688597069	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.438735041896	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.380541692284	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.424964878003	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
1.0	0.818684051582	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.487253272384	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.449557408297	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.430242116057	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.138312174611	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.425067471825	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.358491711724	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.272242754801	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.389598904375	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.165159268771	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.394740603809	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.333994001263	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.422461552691	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.

0.0	0.341780012101	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.541171892671	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.326731784295	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.216471250315	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.335787766584	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.636042671354	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.477045587641	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.430196645108	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.428557782197	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.462108168452	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.310783963831	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.347759769981	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.369373958333	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.455798065952	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.446605442451	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.245114985071	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.452518073273	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
1.0	0.757672788534	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.393119435719	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.410620870298	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.526411825019	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.523187742853	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.31607402333	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.30397885997	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.337968844526	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.270230537558	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.

0.0	0.188970325979	Creativity.
0.0	0.283004774041	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.272523909426	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.445843044798	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.369685911742	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.335417363116	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.455522106268	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.0	What should we do?
0.0	0.22000314237	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.184679457442	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.227733882641	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.408506966145	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
1.0	0.651035786632	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.386723947193	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.406595275015	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.411183075502	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.559448504059	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.39544908354	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.314992724024	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.484913572414	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.38979305947	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
1.0	0.932551629426	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.306935829089	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.384022441183	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.781495767865	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.244011286784	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.637498854961	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.

0.0	0.336824771782	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.250552433811	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.206379992943	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.298728317509	I don't care.
0.0	0.400066873431	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.367212853035	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.438788031053	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.604861031448	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.74490560912	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.323374969881	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.543041477116	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.384839355439	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.293315631712	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.0	I do.
0.0	0.296073696779	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.339501585999	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.294376503242	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.532928249254	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.349625937502	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.390252989191	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.32292304596	And I say that to Nikki.

0.0	0.352680468426	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.384508623236	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.409769554179	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.456676560501	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.394054507204	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.0	She was right.
1.0	0.834957100694	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.580388011719	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.361542296899	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.524331881738	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.262382656184	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.210974230413	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.359131126739	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.416626581562	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.409976598694	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.358019645605	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.227510149969	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.196915939927	OK?
1.0	0.85858468019	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.0	Check it out.
0.0	0.452300122973	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.176842620152	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.226065716726	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.263244294268	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.209669242277	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.509462162339	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.151679004422	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.529932846789	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.364312819814	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.439020513478	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.615149599952	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.463529613009	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.355773564792	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.398781618224	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.354048368332	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.0	I understand.
0.0	0.453777206527	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.264288803336	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.193818810429	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.431029607959	That is what I could do for the country.
1.0	0.385780978548	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.147310148908	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.354197952281	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.26514617614	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.478390510163	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.294844777959	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.356999223344	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.193207823645	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.416588600986	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.187090050304	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.170062809463	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.396772446435	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.178065701315	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.344581990163	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.394594386117	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.28760842403	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.366114182296	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.389586429339	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
