0.0	0.196849363686	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.340768583878	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.941185060212	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.151551363375	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
1.0	0.838191436314	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.117293887723	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.427377124444	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.376723410205	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.0743191642153	I got that.
0.0	0.0301122037378	That's not right.
0.0	0.129170454083	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.923277430777	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.24395049545	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.0750852760812	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.657896687738	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.242553491119	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.402026577386	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.162127496375	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.15182456225	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.23273330456	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.125872900582	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.306303596243	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.0455216533532	I like that.
0.0	0.24362505954	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.103832279028	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.513358720807	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.140937928681	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.31382725208	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.226047372561	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.378369565636	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.637227208937	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.322585757384	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.205360028375	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.0836163666251	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.492652782529	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.200307151941	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.644218134377	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.161292223811	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.194059079413	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.0752493638987	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.291301177352	That's fine.
0.0	0.39279487532	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.157392864473	I never said that.
0.0	0.141491413568	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.20000139883	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.307192235844	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.13146592713	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.642497322302	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.221945077957	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.141976765461	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.509520695842	The world has changed.
0.0	0.189541136478	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.108864229879	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.0700036170712	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.348417591336	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.479740975502	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.0120961362057	OK?
0.0	0.247897253007	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.0466497649112	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.294708580545	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.41713060523	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.048136789936	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.0986740086438	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.00613094703083	Alright.
0.0	0.0076117223259	...No, sir...
1.0	0.891329351008	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.365986895513	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.160679482249	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.097754420888	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.449614675934	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.0633400119813	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.198569494707	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.361597497539	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.252569245399	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.208728490974	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.175826487381	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.164977541521	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.110984182987	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
1.0	0.985606949729	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
1.0	0.999998096482	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.809683217389	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.291205916943	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.135784120562	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.772736654183	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.53394905116	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.220120326716	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.0147218709148	Thank you.
0.0	0.228527363075	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.307441393273	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
1.0	0.983761568761	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.346749967833	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.359523642115	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.182439836255	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
1.0	0.924278265192	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.697945425716	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.266328001746	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.196779831209	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.415047840944	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.30465538599	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.328317770187	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.0800902307404	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.16036054749	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.332007519206	You bet they do.
0.0	0.0480118863424	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.269763031249	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.166623619624	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.202832851232	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.1337274484	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.0904233345829	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.213634672565	Absolutely.
0.0	0.121271264616	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.025095076063	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.5	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.712800066027	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.257717271336	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.298933206642	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.132851613495	I know every one.
0.0	0.337282268245	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.218422607975	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.438929196554	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.0604700627359	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.545218662709	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.565194707449	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.0934806996971	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.243911578036	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.372113301414	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
1.0	0.86139421536	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.158978077653	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.220588963427	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.819533274906	You opposed him then.
1.0	0.213248905215	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.671649699249	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.235893831492	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.37092700862	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.292743157429	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.265908178917	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.169659364727	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.212412077267	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.517440884931	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.0344270114837	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.213279833817	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.0909427402951	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.435968692407	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.107758089043	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.54273293912	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.445252140157	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.115761842867	He undermines it.
0.0	0.385422928112	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.438884238709	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.385912412066	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.363515059635	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.158891129239	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.399906977054	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.395465922014	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.44191666127	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.13905238559	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.360319619263	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.391794546301	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.213601027497	I have.
0.0	0.42523057517	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.264332398943	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.757469347848	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.0160915875226	It feels different.
0.0	0.159704267507	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.266325390435	I have worked for his re-election.
1.0	0.5	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.0212339944786	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.284612038493	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.165117277368	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.0102233098167	Think about it.
0.0	0.489355915398	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.0504702178096	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.261035673691	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.191479797309	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.26413423908	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.348480036884	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.270874668565	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.313971554474	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.27171588724	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.0579916303762	You find me...
0.0	0.142888450345	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.478961670799	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.174366224468	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.282042398989	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.584100251183	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.214902453269	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.467767633698	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.128854881163	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.

0.0	0.252301058608	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.305987761586	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.678476539225	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.155992201182	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.0971759888999	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.196904798487	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.537676747382	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.646567889131	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.183537122375	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.816068781038	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.0786412080359	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.639139366687	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.455381047449	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.214973255203	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.20637376052	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.594745092534	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.322304879904	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.220415387007	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.773520801626	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.226567609178	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.146348707355	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
1.0	0.79151680863	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.116580656398	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.12312710961	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.0911881024381	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.333480271879	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.4158439926	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.19409741812	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.238488396921	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.135498851889	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.191835816588	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.115126286412	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.205525366479	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.0270717261192	So you know what?
0.0	0.174896116172	It's not working.
0.0	0.0568239811748	He's wrong.
0.0	0.415410959262	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.389857442525	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.383045487364	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...

0.0	0.195798348055	I'd sign that executive order.

0.0	0.273323222997	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.226970632125	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.538822625335	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.483495224198	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.213601027497	But...
0.0	0.0934995251053	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.00178798786121	And we are not England.
0.0	0.16771670643	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.0693466987809	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.464620656953	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.23865308622	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.0443997578913	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.196716361718	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.757728978685	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.251658744172	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.19371840692	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.380560147825	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.505119634628	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.289705938531	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.537178443359	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.195723931836	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.170551769228	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.345815811398	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.333509976707	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.236203921266	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.0851354048437	See?
0.0	0.637396684812	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.303793025824	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.182290263716	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.447630196248	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.328817843156	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.1086904079	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.30510495669	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.0075360488798	Divide that out.
0.0	0.149941220128	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.5	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.304719672346	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.364916709078	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.289693695754	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.144008405238	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.136961926353	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.280302712626	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.0506691908921	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.103973946754	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.955602464911	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.0872542761238	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.300590446237	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.242074279196	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.0739039829787	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.463472463627	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.274380930412	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.835129689313	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.128870893845	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.081375197036	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.126365813459	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.383309261225	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.157392864473	I never said that.
0.0	0.133059676603	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.109354976858	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.287626333716	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.461746636066	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.374628719554	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.978918983366	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.311734681603	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.553964933782	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.163034984833	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.183764916759	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.354801863402	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.55622526591	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.328026315399	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.744268877816	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.0617346300752	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.568528915673	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.14669543713	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.570401551149	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.109036635051	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.335209374639	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.080252194809	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.400380544376	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.213601027497	No -- no...
0.0	0.404402272908	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.626878363858	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.248873190394	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.380780026223	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.468951054383	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.402357688202	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.117301747364	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.479055572064	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
1.0	0.812155088139	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.175504772338	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.446921743967	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.174320148897	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.312538660399	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.0224787112175	He does great.
0.0	0.344781489254	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.286021653267	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.0610203689843	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.313497740931	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.108802000027	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.179017142354	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.0108011325966	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.465194427122	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.34791478261	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.999988273083	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.442836976991	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
1.0	0.963938735823	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.0934806806833	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.345071685582	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.210940598548	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.231039894363	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.239097218115	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.144895231415	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.066625386108	I'm ready.
0.0	0.175047827914	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.0270717261192	You know why?
0.0	0.120324172153	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.151547033513	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.132420533381	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.0877398870883	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.334457850047	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.113490024783	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.255674726646	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.195113004612	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.209560880338	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.47237684988	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.209587403267	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.510607996011	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.26687397111	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.691665410941	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.0954357008267	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.278459782356	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.197722517857	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.36192823531	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.128470921098	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.194182746488	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.368657817706	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.618005538089	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.347201221342	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.102354153554	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.5	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.130287321791	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.55210254357	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.026648133139	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.0906829890873	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.197928696672	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.255701855787	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.22994818765	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.295841892254	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.984909655145	...income tax...
0.0	0.229658975155	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.178882283273	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.271412306665	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.2796188986	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.0147218709148	Thank you.
0.0	0.303873459154	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.0822824616876	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.235303869287	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.0105922851091	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.187300459919	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.246290899944	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.303883111948	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.376957303144	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.213601027497	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.256450668376	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.176760378194	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.168966672402	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.09374948829	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.59895073794	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.391457059698	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.489145147902	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.161651321976	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
1.0	0.999999999421	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.225077106805	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.271395854124	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.315766554365	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.312299922393	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.308426284217	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.313356244131	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.213601027497	No.
0.0	0.103516509279	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.306218220899	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.0189700081437	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.305720142487	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.199028440103	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.306192234833	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.578145594736	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.226047372561	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.0596228917607	It never happens.
0.0	0.121587601682	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.249929721827	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.163484410747	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.823957109595	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.88314453023	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.192595681749	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.167798698173	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.223830266785	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.57761879806	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.26218471636	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.5	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.579231378641	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.116972798946	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.297943521934	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?

0.0	0.394352895636	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.679950931257	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.561649006459	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.173026405924	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.150371329531	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.0624545716261	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.0738624798954	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.45333592314	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.112713863185	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.160444309203	The answer is no.
0.0	0.0917324416717	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.442836976991	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.424212170485	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.239747661464	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.617410573428	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.1618070954	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.119593352116	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.258875496811	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.181948940856	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.375408442289	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.0788291486231	John, I'll tell you something.

0.0	0.12618789542	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.252883086376	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.28334542448	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.488881502738	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.144587371788	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.

0.0	0.305089859923	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.530551944935	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.291841754881	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.

0.0	0.78923605303	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?

0.0	0.213634672565	Absolutely.
0.0	0.0770376583844	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.354500069836	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.227467475078	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.42733332888	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.0602143721443	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.403713367024	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.144033614398	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.264258830784	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.390100396874	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.0592979447105	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.

0.0	0.072920561876	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.427182414747	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.396268844191	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.464889293182	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.0919924487118	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.

0.0	0.0430375956122	I understand.
0.0	0.128970301304	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.0443219021298	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.069738077887	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.333512676974	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.115366714034	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.153078532052	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.105189910247	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.0963847364975	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.5	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.141409391568	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.263309698899	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.112179489323	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.099161638274	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.481671661998	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.905960825741	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
1.0	0.99998599933	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.119882894137	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.156468812264	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.338372035755	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.468268656794	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.0613521424565	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.272550000153	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.136550520855	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.0289625445272	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.244921443657	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.0681639315778	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.273529169682	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.116100204364	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.21026309289	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.15305231926	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.208635285621	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.059449735889	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.19049566141	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.436295330944	I changed that.
0.0	0.30589258529	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.313324385863	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.408096806898	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.277522296224	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.684631768035	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.0584461736279	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.469343945774	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.437642380068	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.896054027744	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.587032597222	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.222682838072	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
1.0	0.970241664156	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.0270717261192	You know that.
0.0	0.0844599059423	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.202856491752	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.146686166228	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.0650122809656	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.52174109958	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.5	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.0711651558281	(inaudible).
0.0	0.542236917341	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.5	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.100594130581	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.0301122037378	Right.
0.0	0.911426305128	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.444575814272	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.181044758787	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.595342406427	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.290681768576	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.434005425641	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.378025588972	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.0102233098167	Think about that.
0.0	0.268946437081	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.286876475261	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.27938999883	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.283452790788	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.0147218709148	Thank you.
1.0	0.270945318773	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.29938339946	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.879523335106	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.118730579912	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.664371336289	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.185480805164	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.0886899412013	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.374879351745	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.626709523586	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.183574796633	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.220911732311	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.229478183732	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.28231044284	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.372820290224	We can make a stronger program.
1.0	0.779959813627	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.392225160633	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.16801842688	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.169721391163	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.161333809824	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.0606834851026	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.241301230811	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.836972735761	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.214064858651	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.0192631439722	That is important.
0.0	0.388426896567	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.184819300619	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.0292641930698	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.375982201934	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.379390054073	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.699171994615	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.212030102963	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.379273479489	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.22197633365	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.362533851238	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.108152680741	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.311005213384	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.61943497448	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.162480689636	Yes.
0.0	0.213601027497	Why?
0.0	0.112936972531	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.0928535189243	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.056881930226	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.189401445518	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.244215416603	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.0146718117709	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.186096790301	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.305099401878	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.245466251762	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.758453354319	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.129083278627	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.212412582081	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.22749781241	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.38442646659	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.58793168698	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.605293898445	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.163493597504	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.5	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.201847579187	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.209423808248	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.729332959135	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.586826473424	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.382706017118	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.0723445559831	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.123901285256	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.450763874068	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.0704528554803	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.690189165311	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.559682227075	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.365050323745	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.149337862804	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.519170624027	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.168758262936	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.303890026625	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
1.0	0.250595588532	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.149351215062	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.922674582898	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.0576307591246	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.226181154259	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.209484899594	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.283672550932	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
1.0	0.952490344276	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.154298115034	We need sound money.
0.0	0.211766235655	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.206484617096	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.320250853315	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.171366885411	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.0301122037378	Right.
0.0	0.191721053341	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.211953494489	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.313765748485	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.0331724912318	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.739713448409	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.522482529198	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.305835634217	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.0598840060156	I will not do that.
0.0	0.285615920703	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.0728318608386	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.165240340166	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.168458425464	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.206810917249	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.0682392733604	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.13749293739	I said no.
0.0	0.259803789464	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.094383828319	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.298331788336	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.302000055351	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.0720207735996	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.306935189241	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.5	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.191388581785	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.544139986844	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.446412425075	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.104202191147	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.123607220915	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.0862817359458	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.392404729814	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.847472788254	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.190586862738	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.0855338916293	That's was hard work.
1.0	0.277173034794	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.342285633213	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.0857865332798	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.174105188408	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.25124387467	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.0603529773972	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.201591527807	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.0508597067234	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.199508696729	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.186519774535	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.411044909365	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.316567133824	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.

0.0	0.360475727537	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.

0.0	0.11316020651	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.208243584888	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.197191788338	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.471876506838	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.0102233098167	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.368372947367	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.10754058797	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.

0.0	0.208254391671	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.437778430598	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.

0.0	0.2136426315	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.0123490282661	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.462264393503	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.775911050966	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.150082642891	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.193799161666	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.64778121706	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.364513386728	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.269490902783	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.569753675035	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.

0.0	0.246561085101	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.319460728119	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.12153259912	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.235346983208	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.203405230865	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.70062908148	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.35244676716	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.263097312221	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.362912494513	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.113545807994	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.100158611213	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.142585605322	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.239759682315	I've laid out...
0.0	0.87365480959	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.31086328202	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.0301122037378	That's not right.
0.0	0.46524134215	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.561228028701	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.341151056726	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.160957418574	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.167700809795	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.24274430242	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.0703793222386	Let me just -- let me respond.
1.0	0.398307293541	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.479522225027	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.710649667261	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.0301122037378	Right.
0.0	0.358982133341	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.222833574344	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.588863243747	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.634747596358	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.381753033473	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.173264681167	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.262671052681	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.0559152661705	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.382640223302	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.303535941386	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.0920592458382	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.560063603661	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.207283836255	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.171351888362	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.466820433875	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.0288294362759	And guess what?
0.0	0.448783023475	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.164504276604	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.284207571224	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.162480689636	Yes.
0.0	0.235029700727	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
1.0	0.993728740231	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.26196784639	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.259619838162	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.0728066594689	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.102737023658	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.358692730249	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.265802017597	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.920093379099	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.610151322322	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.637678698379	Illegal.
0.0	0.18897093355	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.0691547171564	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.340591313838	Check it out.
0.0	0.34949050397	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.291984920581	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.0872141731541	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.378648587295	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.138025192915	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.168760120315	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.180515317198	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.455283118088	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.54037551463	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.289811607631	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.0550974407479	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.253052525186	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.0552181087554	You're right.
1.0	0.628850041037	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.332470691865	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.505750210045	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.150984178987	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.304181154053	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.148269361031	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.241285569656	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.283768543231	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.0157298227014	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.125090272597	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.120320303449	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.185400364231	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.151612533645	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.114034464042	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.213601027497	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.2414046522	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.963336354696	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.0888805824513	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.403721954869	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.159089471607	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.467794050151	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.160639546593	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.0354874885064	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.253511411904	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.115144648486	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.254123393139	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.0367090208228	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.364922858165	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.354212096024	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.266101052709	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.376494629721	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.134932648666	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.466969231773	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.190968612338	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.297714164751	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.

0.0	0.51173599316	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.229514654903	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.246198008392	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.312425946562	They're a scam.
0.0	0.578177971107	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.298810586988	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.268538889054	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.142196541577	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.75963191925	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.00760282182978	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.217349150846	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.207581154002	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.337167918327	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.0710389840993	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.246871325562	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.0713427034141	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.16567229089	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.233677830366	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.268307491771	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.316276166837	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.529610955975	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.93504326256	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.144321396341	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.10123392894	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.208593029926	He was on the board.
0.0	0.199435173678	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.0308123774918	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.0301122037378	That's right.
0.0	0.5	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.823566012648	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.239090852596	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.060072223814	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.623390024546	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
1.0	0.983514218334	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.113923183804	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.0912489185429	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.356023174148	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.156734526211	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.0120961362057	OK.
0.0	0.0978235404117	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.305942251819	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.116518374567	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
1.0	0.814125714049	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.483216909421	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.152707871818	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.0224787112175	How great is that?
0.0	0.322230488249	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.31230180778	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.453165254384	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.427427296994	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.428527815335	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.221810316416	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.235352050739	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.213601027497	...
0.0	0.0542972679845	No vision at all.
0.0	0.200511739127	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.0687836741993	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.0743820241461	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.207644504288	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.302255113465	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.238313365814	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.0610652446125	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.550175993624	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.129049839355	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.0892238089783	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.242330788202	Actually a close friend.
1.0	0.997299033087	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.378671552447	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.124227111533	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.814117557644	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.42461628987	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.139407614861	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.469451472441	The number of women --
0.0	0.401444960682	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.474524431885	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.126742516104	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.222373102217	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.0147218709148	Thank you.
0.0	0.186618342315	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.248384485579	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.0785459805869	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.342537400398	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.25433532849	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.262573573481	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.187763629655	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.291301177352	That's fine.
0.0	0.0270717261192	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.0924310895857	And for good cause.
0.0	0.345962511625	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.12444106882	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.109624202117	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.850778694236	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.170250848529	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.44262073371	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.365677193547	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.387423281599	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.0820832795114	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.250898316754	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.202478473473	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.177728235513	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.136561994171	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
1.0	0.45517098005	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.218575401158	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.157191483504	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.165954346015	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.418140139199	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.176457434986	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.127570705584	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.392004777063	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.665633732901	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.327424667353	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.168454337349	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.357973917173	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.139523053391	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.155348699536	But I would add this.
0.0	0.895454892849	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.704013713468	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.491061364917	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.38171751732	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.340499019797	It goes away.
1.0	0.88158991591	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.112894631966	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.147231005142	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.148769972456	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.162202361823	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.714760810032	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.187054596322	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.373578875682	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.0918231372277	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.369870562661	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.395072280826	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.550055022871	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.0839384659997	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.213601027497	And why?
0.0	0.259025012	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.131624217957	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.485230201164	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.0359570935813	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.456874851096	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
1.0	0.906441142945	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.318214116913	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.0760281945803	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.0899106485873	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.195597522746	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.309220801163	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.188660588125	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.296277175894	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.0851589544757	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.11314808546	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.703512709468	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.0850207926816	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.148983447479	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.226456865648	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.177696344573	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
1.0	0.621940038953	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.290990367529	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
1.0	0.810915797825	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.481638220115	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.27167873168	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.688450670042	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.321370352041	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.507248760146	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.401947132275	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.156188415261	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.153749651785	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.0456299908452	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.134861719333	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.213601027497	No.
0.0	0.279107185486	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.0126361180845	Yeah.
0.0	0.400739783122	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.965862025104	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.457768736916	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.186428580844	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.426768662724	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
1.0	0.958473471001	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.514601574266	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.28092228881	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.398801402816	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.356345116865	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.714555345408	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.31268775567	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.45419547549	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.743539633232	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.13171056682	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.213027587046	I promise.
0.0	0.120452341102	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.303065802296	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.207146344711	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.0301122037378	That is not right.
0.0	0.157039723942	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.14448411799	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.163102294192	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.150828218544	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.

0.0	0.204521771542	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.297815208113	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.22646873815	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.210596017462	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.716426258091	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.29012977892	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.245196188541	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.176331565369	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.606442891598	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.0499275993886	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.108478757176	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.187907504996	It's true.
0.0	0.311406532959	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.424566918192	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.156208247181	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.131999428832	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.211302773226	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.185951075876	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.0128462860931	Maria...
0.0	0.157469624661	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.158468209042	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.386514657033	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.335695110295	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.0325825747832	That's the difference.
0.0	0.470865537574	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.209497769297	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.371435242606	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.804522069565	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.344190880597	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.845817930571	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.198289083536	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.561649006459	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.0607195851659	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.261816344128	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
1.0	0.434820587024	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.103104598632	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.770247708366	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.278486081633	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.31581615122	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.36932980306	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.191388581785	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.157285356598	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.257905800492	Both served.
0.0	0.0507240054217	We need security.
0.0	0.350155193671	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.58688340602	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
1.0	0.99744801126	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.318656937234	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.0661940521218	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.255934929107	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.754956487031	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.490907558365	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.363168494997	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.0951182007715	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.0364434708201	I can't do it.
0.0	0.195100266107	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.245196188541	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.249820641964	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.0779017227086	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.202076736039	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.161918673253	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.0413822272012	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.127816415786	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.312450521544	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.553291387081	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.320640063365	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.45409975701	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.165411735472	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.67342161638	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.0596228917607	It never happens.
0.0	0.0208712689083	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.368696893228	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.398382135571	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.0631886643206	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.706001802212	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.165199391157	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.848058627248	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.205513173446	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.242649060304	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.194106888638	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.296155543777	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.0843339646205	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.0598840060156	I will do that.
0.0	0.322115075392	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.126681480286	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.363951097148	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.255051213504	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.541839209874	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.180590619516	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.163217343501	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.0241167771661	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.493034577345	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.0147218709148	Thank you.
0.0	0.0691302046742	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.00926679977635	Wait for what?
0.0	0.0830911184627	We're friends.
0.0	0.116518977757	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.209819211325	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.538149790313	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.27915657236	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.18336108065	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.232704678317	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.232164066627	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.167318546333	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.18053322296	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.519570651355	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.389471703789	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.769897557345	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.749012275565	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.0551498304543	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.31850780469	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.240020278159	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.0186285577096	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.457716358089	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.241705932633	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.407561189406	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
1.0	0.992087320873	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.962862086975	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.294251346819	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.225488326455	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.0863319866376	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.190641301566	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.283629301959	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.196476345254	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.0154494053707	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.0230451193483	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.263413160003	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.232756233088	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.0508810671421	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.0448341485161	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.244924977627	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.287623664915	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.374565192331	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.13385063662	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.34477843917	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.145605886731	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.274045304522	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.248997952373	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.139687030997	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.193641264783	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.333945664375	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.0162623780692	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.0237074633437	We have no borders.
0.0	0.279465903202	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
1.0	0.999998648528	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.266637349288	We actually did it.
0.0	0.0270717261192	And you know what?
0.0	0.558997673235	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.229355457448	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.117668320287	I have no idea.
0.0	0.0748382336479	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.188172601144	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.142037622471	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.130637031368	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.122342260003	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.268508977384	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.206062492715	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.25720061076	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.134354967532	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.553899082762	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.475778050532	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.950396221739	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.139446551756	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.61115947997	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.306551385807	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.132595240836	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.292573832582	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.431474826335	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.159980856945	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.411173068812	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.440306023779	This country is changing.
0.0	0.17447757279	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.702289984919	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.161935168411	We're running.
0.0	0.466369799535	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.689005731277	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.198362551661	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.351640468537	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.707318552837	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.0798529093102	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.149166808854	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.123461580425	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.219381451128	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.298416553634	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.12406982169	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.167477843097	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.0761258769264	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.212671152724	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.415508604391	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.0771604961674	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.311748957555	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.156929370304	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.10244810033	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.185034303654	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.213601027497	This is 2016.
0.0	0.843405478336	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.026392538323	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.106602660567	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.0541828819109	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.231282240437	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.490501532875	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.265897581758	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.228029786067	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.273178698254	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.335018920128	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.66301761341	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.629524199358	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.376776673542	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.281403401014	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.32294430098	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.219842863155	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.358573937511	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.379307859164	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.217229283492	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.213601027497	How about this?
0.0	0.122886124482	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.213601027497	...
0.0	0.536236525623	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.0698988987055	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.313208796309	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.0547094553887	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.164845250779	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.154013558875	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.429259767971	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.483620385773	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.514138530117	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.182959758692	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.57877063796	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.113490024783	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.114646552661	I love this country.
0.0	0.186742565958	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.878857001003	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.106812342884	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.329039967724	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.102778156557	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.383951438708	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.281478620215	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.84507909125	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.334511722421	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.603072706656	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.179207145776	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.0820832795114	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.241938542802	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.0833217399822	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.138212781614	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.455762648919	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.0564103865961	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.477696144353	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.0147218709148	Thank you.
0.0	0.269521065002	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.250263774029	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.158339572254	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.241423894278	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.0732285546054	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.318372552405	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.303695378	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.0833231246153	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.388571155152	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.377458530748	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.703384878833	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.191465989702	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
1.0	0.996019111705	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.0365844555064	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.211743464023	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.442766149022	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.23357638211	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.238193399195	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.122419485274	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.329338244722	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.419723988079	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.23783656935	What have you got now?
0.0	0.289268685837	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.545434119822	And the reason -- and the reason...
1.0	0.928949057487	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.221223756844	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.131646314525	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.206005695355	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.231507956384	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.0126361180845	Yeah.
0.0	0.178938079751	Yes, it's very simple.
1.0	0.999987356945	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
1.0	0.993837620948	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.130988638863	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.127629497002	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.228098599133	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.161935168411	We're running.
0.0	0.337369112384	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.196292682689	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.674558314937	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.213601027497	...
0.0	0.285015758696	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.409411226022	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.375178514079	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.251486884691	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.228498517583	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.434682830063	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.525784292349	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.0486202739098	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.215867536194	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.370155075968	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.0921812396799	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.211262456618	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.217763639563	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.296044188704	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.297393267667	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.264983632485	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.53228345273	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.0304691712664	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.390994245685	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.184717535418	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.0652121695715	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.193976636086	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.150007987614	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.130344124151	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.0578578310978	You just want to...
0.0	0.0441049293516	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.123989480046	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.591718694005	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.330076011207	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.531433680624	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.283617638778	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.182700090194	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.320262069532	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.555584399812	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.881431390508	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.857312653067	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.0756373727598	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.556165387702	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.660170933182	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.196388660764	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.447792915289	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.64895440666	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.059449735889	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.226753345377	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.199342104623	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.423953999243	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.0774995489664	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.520678813321	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.178565864455	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.119396160823	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.0301122037378	She was right.
0.0	0.0129712886591	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.0390534418847	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.917881171014	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.242879375351	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.465226006256	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.19249205963	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.0716426883928	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.112836699472	Thank you for that question.
1.0	0.990236176518	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.613015998965	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.130293896536	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.0626005906881	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.904717859277	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.0924337994303	It is why we have to simplify.
1.0	0.876924396669	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.254852104249	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.240961225142	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.343701418078	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.340189375323	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.217876582925	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.308523192708	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.0818305496328	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.171087345809	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.30089519219	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.15004957558	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.364896920942	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.20487855615	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.233283112225	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.266608041895	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.368701147218	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.235634565272	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.145464579042	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.368980160297	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.234697911437	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.328018134256	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.10025498787	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.481048809459	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.317447308831	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.483979463296	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.209407895211	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.424822587268	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.917632358447	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.343236818175	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.476099005522	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.625150791987	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.338780500966	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.466862698454	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.903713186764	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.273975550426	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.754026618985	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.212978983771	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.53506976276	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.903084630797	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...

0.0	0.0146718117709	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.164649768942	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.226567609178	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.0806971923414	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.257967623178	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.191371819472	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.146964158075	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.46039204124	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.508315514199	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.371295154709	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.560928013215	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.214543473896	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.397341940731	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.5	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.191480085311	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.335586959318	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.0147218709148	Thank you.
0.0	0.297391486874	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.113391611945	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.327384447086	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.383094493458	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.640909642702	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.0753596384965	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.281401123569	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.532408956521	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.259829130986	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.211679751415	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.304612635197	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.336960366801	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.264278323661	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.117913618897	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.15589356505	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.584641014898	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.160047020436	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.445274216982	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.236921114248	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.293006666988	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.259837792075	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.298053475663	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.211319951363	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.236932650743	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.353819345614	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.187719905267	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.42018789558	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.0420661216659	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.472911202529	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.213601027497	And here's why.
0.0	0.387391222502	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.0693964707801	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.299427850527	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.15810114579	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.251203461923	The Europeans have moved on.
1.0	0.794648516625	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.0270717261192	How do I know this?
0.0	0.213437999729	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.137957140187	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
1.0	0.5	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.283772665176	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.191150889549	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
1.0	0.999982324796	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.0609814659144	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.24620075899	She said the truth.
0.0	0.114952493743	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.314206173673	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.386192771043	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.231621460123	I'm tested.
0.0	0.782348623086	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.299413389761	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.771017640488	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.0899390725971	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.159877228993	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.258792478888	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.25128883327	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.265282614293	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.0621980807445	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.547799260482	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.88255577156	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.341021498534	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.245699388983	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.163900147437	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.31014617095	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.982266310827	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.0960461057398	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.5	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.31224034532	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.27245922261	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.137339999468	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.408579948285	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.138952627947	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.0482252575809	We haven't.
0.0	0.311584500485	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.15353650469	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.354384750839	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.274978545775	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.178145467919	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.199991766515	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.428228099023	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.392805945064	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.112358982634	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.188993100673	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.384949536904	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.806208558973	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.478961670799	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.520394285561	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.520398590022	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.575706396979	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.463248535887	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.345171326937	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.928056269874	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.131312242527	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.0364434708201	We can't do it.
0.0	0.146119975411	My background is different.
1.0	0.999997352628	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.355548485624	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.788521562889	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.0917572024281	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.329951847911	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.352376536792	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.319141686398	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.0311070695545	They're off to China.
0.0	0.129630479692	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.315468399328	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.214739264773	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.341892688781	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.230383124487	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.20245137903	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.0901275725622	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.761949602411	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.314535327177	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.214950232204	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.102737023658	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.231032879855	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.618107900832	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.480614876629	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.256033514627	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.738340174003	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.204549728458	This will end.
0.0	0.343570302695	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.663279393165	Just for the record.
0.0	0.697439435838	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.288654022834	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.393056593063	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.297907534764	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.182291342347	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.355716002681	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.0120961362057	OK.
0.0	0.197020946256	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.

0.0	0.0483699775373	And God bless America.
0.0	0.483180467448	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.0330668928996	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.364861721261	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.311220725797	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.2422359975	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.260705818804	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.167585545183	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.234600663869	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.65689950244	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.400657694543	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.621957047762	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.576282544989	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.409417761098	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.213601027497	It is.

0.0	0.356543138404	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.0954339894329	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.189954089424	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.778863363483	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.154844392566	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.340642423882	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.212692770701	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.939972320613	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.0120961362057	OK?
1.0	0.999999980788	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.40613326445	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.421156411903	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.475236275558	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.

0.0	0.921513736101	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.152348430279	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
1.0	0.972306041284	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.198909465756	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.0770712900101	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.115073035379	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.107064106391	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.0270717261192	They know.
1.0	0.999999228937	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.3529047738	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.249901760348	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.524598848517	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.369718531794	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.40472780639	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.120196601815	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.309220801163	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.617648337674	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.351808173469	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.685212669895	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.739266126373	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.353710724017	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.371183103229	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.517269929087	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.164013411621	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.21313865046	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.0597229602946	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.195922230233	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.240338922957	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.607805018215	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.0551558190042	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.199616811782	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.170205978757	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.318707579631	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.0634314700402	On welfare.
0.0	0.032390431979	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.39279487532	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.148296787376	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.279010458125	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.942022547136	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.232480832524	That is our government today.
0.0	0.384336605548	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.338163707053	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.46087559411	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.20025938786	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.392955298995	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.170095231061	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.243310047099	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.219266358855	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.366242057639	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.863945557396	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.190451861708	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.0950695919478	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.31577195423	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.650815167901	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.258950414655	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.342702299804	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.0879360730891	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.113015047889	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.437736040529	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.720557649741	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.227913587811	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.100970432348	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.231933352754	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.330776684916	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.348485494027	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.385705384234	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.424096078947	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.122946705386	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.194485385843	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.138555837146	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.0568239811748	We were wrong.
0.0	0.0779017227086	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
1.0	0.999999972967	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.0818091540512	...before I go.
0.0	0.160550299768	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.213601027497	That has not been...
0.0	0.333890179542	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.165144528389	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
1.0	0.966090530362	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.162480689636	Yes.
0.0	0.148983447479	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.458267651945	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.266358794972	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.120126534052	I would change them.
0.0	0.388811403442	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.342822525934	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.116908120972	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.323244403273	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.0581110948994	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.18094534851	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.136257300949	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.403371016555	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.130091506142	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
1.0	0.961307695205	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
1.0	0.96736367499	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.145420575828	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.207199809623	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.340591313838	Check it out.
0.0	0.0500701739896	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.158123704718	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.827386817411	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.202489723344	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.191235514958	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.229611817909	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.253497073311	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.137934998706	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.124149478105	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.230303634665	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.261003390195	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.544215071008	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.0434433587625	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.619603274886	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.875049873806	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.4705954844	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.487900958002	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
1.0	0.993086645745	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.256440652802	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.510446954613	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.0147218709148	Thank you.
0.0	0.0584729792861	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.0721498532759	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.602873193527	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.0495882059685	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.029908909025	Well, sure.
0.0	0.30089519219	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.101262339604	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.119778877775	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
1.0	0.190043998292	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.399402639015	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.125516069301	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.130861969385	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.219261543612	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.0957607397864	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.154392718086	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.538801204993	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.274145662745	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.146558279324	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.329634552091	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.

0.0	0.255381588769	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.385416761766	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.0225063825714	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.388256417259	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.476532509812	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.294085025137	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.277810461493	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.7297058116	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.371943302294	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.0999496606012	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.191965052884	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...

0.0	0.0607467028888	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.133468513185	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.

0.0	0.0135786046793	Neil...

0.0	0.468788290212	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.

0.0	0.357041404556	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.

0.0	0.0692393457392	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.24164793869	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.086934875383	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.379433718875	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.430778387184	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.

0.0	0.0147218709148	Thank you.
0.0	0.0929432159382	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.586651238658	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.103427636342	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.0971483701383	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.0727662180405	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.0541056294717	So you might not.
0.0	0.0918805427607	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.316830111168	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.0677441602464	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.0270717261192	And you know what?
0.0	0.162501359014	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.354986362306	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.228066339188	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.147375259886	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.374644961761	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.16710181094	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.384898468638	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.105723002175	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.428415794399	But I was born here.
0.0	0.360131545937	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.213601027497	Again...
0.0	0.195708685428	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.229966000715	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.0475429989837	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.439589255555	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.483148191622	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.0599141929663	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.706830269464	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
1.0	0.0977617692582	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.0123160182077	Okay.
0.0	0.181843521666	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.261143546361	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.0816128951561	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.087896125975	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.308354013611	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.194932754484	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.5	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.0760205570431	I don't like that.
0.0	0.232209623386	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.379732651721	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.0102233098167	Think about it.
0.0	0.699306493547	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.40444235113	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.217590622475	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.232939774312	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.543785612477	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.388397991895	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.594831762561	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.429302556441	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.264465669618	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.229633009406	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.208477037324	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.131485727306	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.187091004802	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.0185455654691	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.344930987182	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.973866638349	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.530351481508	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.246328784075	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.151190579996	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.0229247146025	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.145600015828	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.167637669832	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.369895024457	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.257627384484	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.189348238399	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.314206173673	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.187907504996	No, it's true.
0.0	0.0224109770537	We are not France.
0.0	0.379273479489	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.624319520226	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.203525704371	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.0631680805944	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.0426491134394	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.5	He has never defended...
0.0	0.902782092957	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.166633859326	Our next president...
1.0	0.993151490029	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.308382744922	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.173053507853	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.806965669044	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.126397960235	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.701914625849	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.349262043146	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.168883629437	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.119836666111	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.11065514703	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.0106075227766	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.061284643385	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.336556965506	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.301736257252	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.130167149692	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.137007569211	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.191773901516	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.137492122663	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.0791097644608	Good at email.
0.0	0.26814222719	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.748252133617	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.0900777864173	I don't care.
0.0	0.821654690222	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.213601027497	So...
0.0	0.0714295250954	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.18422425068	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.255051213504	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.697119509359	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.159329410843	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.1743205023	I would just say that...
0.0	0.318703672882	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.457294561916	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.404063151625	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.336744687	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.305323025027	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.152202905682	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.230287487489	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.468827274639	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.287504154315	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.228769395698	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.0773530063039	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.213601027497	...
0.0	0.29726878061	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.284388396936	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.418459323642	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.256717985906	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.334623304588	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.133624342983	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.13299099513	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.119458802444	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.799130634003	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.206295974647	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.214759074475	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.181577906773	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.150389173397	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.614315767348	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.

0.0	0.0317010330811	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.165107546463	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.

0.0	0.0451082402141	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.511262524422	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.405145736894	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.285542449017	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.219423408603	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
1.0	0.987615441788	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.

0.0	0.0819697247322	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.153001575084	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.074327928615	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.

0.0	0.184624766767	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.0504702178096	It's not only a problem here.

0.0	0.213601027497	No.
0.0	0.527469361039	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.363557947428	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.

0.0	0.0902606492365	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.130423280686	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.175092331724	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.420620152696	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.0760205570431	They don't like that.
0.0	0.718510977094	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.213968426611	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.157392864473	I never said that.
0.0	0.171939887156	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.318373321391	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.166326855714	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.0217173205489	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.262089777592	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.

0.0	0.135759174158	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.210810983448	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.213601027497	Why is that?
1.0	0.999996856417	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.248299703349	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.338820137244	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.315083786507	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.131104789496	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.539419473118	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.

0.0	0.193064359526	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.0987650125339	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.289204143015	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.217227423769	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.516741845063	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.366433833252	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.555842745085	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.35607414022	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.236968845576	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.244856860771	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.152423157476	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.268398461664	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.162480689636	Yes.
0.0	0.051547297356	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.287999544457	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.189397317506	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.0277293454408	OK, good.
0.0	0.569232326007	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.33284270849	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.646419543416	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.300646738302	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.47594144925	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.125638728918	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.310414943014	White people?
0.0	0.173847872712	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.35462759631	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.121818626073	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.0307518989449	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.0977411243971	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.178408200744	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.0834829993474	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.164016084413	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.300722925662	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.110565402024	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.371108347735	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.272922264879	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.117973101042	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.398280239396	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.493738217368	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.283995971782	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.455461597978	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.152548951252	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.906892814477	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.838191436314	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.669979528336	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.227488242266	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.169645030122	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.250382202902	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.856899743461	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.392534365992	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.0646795918278	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.860391881007	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.298392968642	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.757947287758	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.470714081875	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.364127345718	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.228623142524	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.464896926318	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.0986612881849	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.972717152268	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.0482252575809	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.0229702653047	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.382183085545	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.0611683186199	You really can't.
0.0	0.474856145895	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.108286629091	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.226267919289	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.114866221067	...John...
0.0	0.33715625781	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.225165869096	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.36021277069	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.0863660426532	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.249289493	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.314653609336	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.0301122037378	Right.
0.0	0.188420360569	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.286855862515	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.129853696398	You know why three?
0.0	0.208015486617	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.678936432496	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.435239888367	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.81749731909	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.0146782908891	That's how you solve the problem.

0.0	0.234384910508	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.59538927992	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.

0.0	0.172132896234	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.

0.0	0.476250508641	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.751782284009	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.442163627389	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.234756748316	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.144282787974	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.

0.0	0.355672946125	...Rand is exactly right.
1.0	0.746583665013	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.290194576161	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.170312078555	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.441153418276	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.

0.0	0.463324012066	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.484214902024	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...

0.0	0.636877951069	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.

0.0	0.251658744172	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.200515795246	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.373625964445	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.550191128049	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.135192687931	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.101079775001	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.335240362978	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.

0.0	0.257168207594	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.

0.0	0.454137030378	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.33256816305	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.481056169299	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?

0.0	0.178833196223	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.303282903046	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.383637032994	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.275374742806	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.

0.0	0.0286014438699	We have to stand with them.
