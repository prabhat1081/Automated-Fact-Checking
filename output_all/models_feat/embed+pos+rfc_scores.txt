0.0	0.799683723248	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.377335289791	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.520698684701	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?

0.0	0.967618380375	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.22357911566	I'm totally open to a tariff.

0.0	0.485943042086	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.

0.0	0.269504087058	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.241384892066	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.366566491654	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.356900080986	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.153964318624	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.161263362748	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.220713125453	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.481201241274	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
1.0	0.648886189945	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.230690037754	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.429583091082	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.158307897146	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.218820021731	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.655895230857	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.266691611785	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.876430886737	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.0782437400733	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.613725872761	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.519558361845	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.

0.0	0.185812645891	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.131637399364	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.976636574098	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.573731781918	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.543648278491	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.

0.0	0.141784472797	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.323029081553	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.343091525187	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.279402536839	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.938506699921	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.592796711816	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.17585968755	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.808073383601	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.

0.0	0.116153644009	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
1.0	0.613810059742	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
1.0	0.941009476295	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.16920707639	OK.
0.0	0.217349981874	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.645354349077	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.230368932623	They were wrong.
0.0	0.337115693825	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.393716892881	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.274155185288	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.370322331033	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.

0.0	0.353120644807	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.201505617087	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.185676768756	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.571344711704	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.

0.0	0.217429096324	I didn't.

0.0	0.30516473464	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.232452969988	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.

0.0	0.273173572215	I was recruited to H.P.
1.0	0.5	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.

0.0	0.631252416715	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.413008154648	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.5	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.167892401453	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.550558914119	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.277871340217	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.150170610655	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.547376555413	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.

0.0	0.178057864226	Absolutely.
0.0	0.573005090715	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.182083930235	...before I go.
0.0	0.12921229938	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.783446014796	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
1.0	0.631584745431	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.563313034623	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.266541401806	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.622350292006	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.248245259656	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.585856922134	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.353369957048	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.221039094109	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.387220782189	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.438517820641	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.127930820329	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.295566282588	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.594168307632	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.548164120978	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.494925036765	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.971705760991	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.277253011782	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.410888377057	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.60020422651	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.745631597178	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.670633177265	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.945778095461	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.115519878291	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.459636307491	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.5	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.227686955905	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.3582930075	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.359325433069	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.889359834331	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.655631385542	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.547922400017	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.48991246409	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.164159716332	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.387815927172	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.5	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.172376249128	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.10594922863	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.409524754478	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.457220932179	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.358078616955	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.25941881742	It is.
0.0	0.148306564297	Neil...
0.0	0.368239844566	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.0791139068751	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.322940529381	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.581741664035	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.254072258942	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.523540690013	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.517756709626	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.409316186702	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.172491250196	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.348785706104	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.443457886607	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.235566156717	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.395247352883	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.379734855621	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.878157250057	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.26513846429	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
1.0	0.650023929466	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.

0.0	0.5	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.184142841978	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.280496195248	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.533546155882	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.223231429449	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.375095716971	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.660805647078	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.487813426576	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.544996071108	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.182935244847	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.564999298132	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.467778580122	There is no money in the Social Security account.

0.0	0.168640035408	That is not right.

0.0	0.321085235652	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.255151083889	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.

0.0	0.259447611106	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.687973643719	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.491755475604	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.175711720873	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.

0.0	0.141344905187	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.360085937675	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.244954340895	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
1.0	0.21331574158	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.244359186308	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.241482563854	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.

0.0	0.396134722611	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.662405464281	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.137993679109	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.223723634899	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.151761020686	It feels different.
0.0	0.298306709816	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.5	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.

0.0	0.834323125683	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.768026103543	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.23549483821	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.742611082212	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.21470615568	They're a scam.
0.0	0.20933909272	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.

0.0	0.0735452783265	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.328496865784	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.269875943614	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.

0.0	0.222377867574	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.234589651515	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.356009969201	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.193171110071	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.263516104896	White people?
0.0	0.208437176158	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.695573980329	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.250805431185	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.259964724547	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.229789945547	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.213304621495	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.341455834827	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.951305033607	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.165524421378	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.415060722193	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.253708953155	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.140671645854	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.230631553255	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
1.0	0.426238908776	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.294822493018	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.994662514274	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.94510887493	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.72849214747	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.387724172698	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.0778835143555	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.252465823184	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.158272702241	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.729027250361	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.403434642303	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.857804676768	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.108677850978	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.591194453012	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.429444076754	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.600440528685	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.718131709627	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.0589481868066	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.454146471809	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.298079027196	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.402595116287	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.584244944324	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.155906166545	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.139789624481	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.309332921514	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.182971796884	I agree with them.
0.0	0.717764519628	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.821765031253	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.362464601205	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.335553948016	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.522230084116	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.277616501868	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.876154402115	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
1.0	0.543616382152	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.766548161694	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.297439700547	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.532661213208	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.817026411351	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.719805044388	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.113367515846	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.131820023041	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.167930328491	That is absolutely inaccurate.
1.0	0.94562697073	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.342965290372	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.671253198398	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.443861387087	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.285868350857	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.0784041418232	...Thank you.
0.0	0.196879663772	Right.
0.0	0.284288835939	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.202385533472	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.252125430882	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.116534136322	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.23178960118	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.692781641946	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.240605418867	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.32000906843	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.204441593795	Ever.
0.0	0.351270026861	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.190044487048	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.586443933351	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.177935188462	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.26909941783	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.306278422124	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.665722280763	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.772143447266	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.872129326281	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.145545624519	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.111575024671	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.637441990494	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.227848379716	That is...
0.0	0.561220319283	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.411323259545	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
1.0	0.797302149901	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.48488804766	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.306910658861	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.645997187665	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.425158384929	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.256032242202	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.335982783035	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.276531399636	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
1.0	0.788416976263	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.535094294583	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.221247502967	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.209453374716	So you know what?
0.0	0.790769792553	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.637605416167	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.185493940703	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.136455224245	Check it out.
0.0	0.261560070997	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.656315314563	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.179840483536	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.490195588142	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.550186614026	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.201309480033	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.624419959972	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.172056889981	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.6867112476	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.47224408572	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.805404108815	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.138620503447	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.953935349828	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.247093445816	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.590122885404	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.349695722094	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.203597003159	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.196879663772	Right.
0.0	0.128845093327	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.383054747804	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.250726925816	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.246794189638	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.830108179387	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.334986107087	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.311257462029	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.287519361683	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.261000112541	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.686879209484	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.824559998352	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.373171877831	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.148782796273	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.823905604685	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.571864860047	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.115999021599	You don't have to say that.
1.0	0.919990330862	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.90382472953	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.401114804819	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.872957553665	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.196458444627	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.313360601435	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.202692688004	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.210724339323	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.168075409832	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.165200990183	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.287348331449	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.215350899213	So you might not.
0.0	0.492994948942	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
1.0	0.958047606092	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.823505541442	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
1.0	0.56382340827	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.150515341417	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.260712161386	Both served.
0.0	0.160403709236	They do whatever what they do, OK.
1.0	0.980329800051	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.433974899244	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.457298500544	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.458476077648	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.331714704996	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.372800281677	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.261772776203	I do.
0.0	0.292146558235	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.164526457729	I would just say that...
0.0	0.130469516062	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.476426700599	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.0607449596863	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.0934099443654	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.202329955161	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.229818943012	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.275817566869	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.0717828031215	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.443397855942	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.410198097015	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.181055492996	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.239314662944	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.209235068493	The answer is no.
0.0	0.104849316536	...Chris...
0.0	0.368525239476	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.453858729234	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.279190431087	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.688248092655	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.111323538709	And guess what?
0.0	0.187119783114	Yes.
0.0	0.602107237466	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.878873324618	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.744923375668	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.313710637544	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.295925839266	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.5	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.701226120383	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.255182579776	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.257144634746	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
1.0	0.939102200549	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.151811323065	That's good.

0.0	0.388169523404	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.602208624617	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.404579335646	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.

0.0	0.188900664091	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.206714592667	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.270436051891	The most mistreated people.

0.0	0.0918254279153	Thank you.
0.0	0.11903336497	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.210288325321	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.177417891932	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.406051646633	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.

0.0	0.930034448351	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.187948122789	That's my bill.
0.0	0.175971592394	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.141972426279	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.372281512795	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.182711805989	You're right.
0.0	0.378522503721	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.

0.0	0.424685620534	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.311770805397	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.349130085565	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.811594194873	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.0610204871698	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.666556638888	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.626548405827	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.714888404788	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.581894878278	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.187105943523	No accomplishment.

0.0	0.5	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.286815115729	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.524355036878	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.513315511955	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.464741836168	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.362718421218	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.72051151449	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.78429602301	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.682562366679	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.47119666084	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.56166889442	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.172559456014	Okay.
0.0	0.867115991167	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.159309357275	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.290153234881	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.0909271036857	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.37384797984	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.215713187097	Big difference.
0.0	0.434048767619	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
1.0	0.848463767551	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.356593396512	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.231337536912	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.821397257055	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.179812653035	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.144146915769	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.225850576251	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.398490509793	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.358939206103	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.160952502183	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
1.0	0.880548734838	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.801667735378	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.254852143164	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.36001722258	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.274048007463	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.588827861866	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.255871611013	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.100931241539	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.355262452251	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.10169543033	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.363765539485	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.603769912941	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.0945746051311	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.555818332521	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.612029933296	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.480097795227	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.135825961178	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.343010599993	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.0811035129081	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.229076050051	We're friends.
0.0	0.280984779062	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.139195725847	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.391408588616	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.833203000557	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.0918254279153	Thank you.
0.0	0.185444743274	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.22363641316	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.322675273178	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.328351799562	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.62157024944	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.176975626476	I love China.
0.0	0.763736091196	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.47955012637	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.203828322016	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.25053422209	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.21614062244	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.722246898612	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.136787330771	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.268436832701	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.155495525752	You bet they do.
0.0	0.235110761184	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.372286172071	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.626156214995	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.838081951241	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.247184611001	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.222425727865	That never works.
0.0	0.143216756275	He's wrong.
0.0	0.5	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.188013453549	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.666556638888	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.273634672922	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.620334545975	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.492555526608	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.262318037274	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.104558735125	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.222158016082	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.219511252791	And, we said no.
1.0	0.697291175935	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.966741834073	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.298108176309	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.315986026788	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.137367498595	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.865121692863	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.614868347488	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.218448295867	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.396534810378	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.775121977844	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.282964323988	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.173773308125	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.199569065124	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.233013454647	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.432723828379	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.222807732894	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.234388630092	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.163975316907	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.177898689009	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.200020610023	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.207670381522	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.168640035408	That's not right.
0.0	0.858295043273	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.207773591912	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.286266424011	No, no.
0.0	0.293223981998	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.514903897629	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.639055710112	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.37504464316	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.224597023321	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.26909687254	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.889873453524	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.663512419872	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.0745085551982	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.187936556795	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.312113242188	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.637956106831	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.823317735255	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.187119783114	Yes.
0.0	0.455562672954	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.144455751709	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.117281425966	Divide that out.
0.0	0.196528221217	I'm tested.
0.0	0.318307115018	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.43839764021	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.175650763674	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.290598722362	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.149788609729	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.213346519607	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.0671561015345	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.180738105716	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.777103536711	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.265722277744	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.547278594451	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.458125172211	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.393867035176	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.536251089219	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.41577314123	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.291990298054	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.652611841764	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.696701553071	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.618384077445	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.244561599069	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.210708781445	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.507081696215	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.176846308668	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.142139304441	I don't care.
0.0	0.183729007174	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.828022068168	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.297596771341	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.221203058086	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.0966956281678	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.17481953035	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.109600477118	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.402659960755	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.489929560698	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.320027685695	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.759602164865	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.102398952872	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.313933685576	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.444732891455	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.285025549702	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.258627485391	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.623368428719	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.23921965575	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.200956702382	That's fine.
0.0	0.162058453239	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.234735609233	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.245449987127	Again...
0.0	0.530153043923	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.11458878179	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.196879663772	Right.
0.0	0.129024543567	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.2962474711	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.399104044358	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.152143325234	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.479041315195	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.471094530371	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.677737767341	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.26499322735	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.956368270388	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.105855095266	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.32344643598	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.164683169865	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.0905743764543	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.735740146386	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.269595738757	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.595626615449	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.387606623542	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.289976990524	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.2605958705	That has not been...
0.0	0.311043261835	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.261772776203	We do.
0.0	0.243994839362	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.612099295686	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.556668720519	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.130924995606	I will not do that.
0.0	0.554737693718	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.415142669599	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.205761919224	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.276975582216	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.0828826468709	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.228155563155	No -- no...
0.0	0.246798129954	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.281646415825	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.136709461096	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.846742672163	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.403469325424	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.30684183716	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.483263529165	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.651449114919	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.173911344659	Well, sure.
0.0	0.28323026123	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.590858203302	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.427549591191	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.425259838877	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.367485046417	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.540011425864	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.369380536677	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.136592409442	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.545317723616	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.870714947046	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.356772777654	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.195771440372	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.586851686086	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
1.0	0.732588933587	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.465639924363	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.377184487275	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.858433560567	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.357295419166	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.14809429582	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.277383668979	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.154164926883	We have to do something.
0.0	0.665152819104	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.251853820105	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.699505195155	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.228600232875	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.202475040173	It's a hard problem.
1.0	0.837872319344	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.747580992551	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.195977595506	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.339998263991	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.963736918327	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
1.0	0.282212797674	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.296330827249	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.212794194598	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.5	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.968752411813	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.138493314698	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.381774467943	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.106003102647	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.0715606706603	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.236515549651	...
0.0	0.588606665178	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.253140013995	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.387904561113	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.100109329872	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.218467160732	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.698653185731	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.7206759455	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.517011313206	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.298993172247	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.291160122473	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.150271333749	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.115358161339	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.133894491483	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.144473930683	See?
0.0	0.0907009274613	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.655484039445	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.112640458152	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.517098296906	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.300642859803	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.0918254279153	Thank you.
0.0	0.160366428745	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.5	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.530291998826	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
1.0	0.949021807244	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
1.0	0.0619049684599	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.439357422592	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.231421366651	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.309463504071	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.407498217338	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.435543474175	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.

0.0	0.837316343675	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.

0.0	0.886342573982	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.

0.0	0.155046149793	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.296099159905	How about this?
0.0	0.286973081762	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.155020920782	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.224217281579	-- the governor's absolutely right.

0.0	0.0899793888756	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.933993849572	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.239507201474	I love this country.
0.0	0.136455224245	Check it out.
0.0	0.282705282441	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.322861317147	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.30967675566	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.303930434752	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.163041722111	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.296735431446	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.482095685695	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.295332116819	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.110353542048	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.377375037682	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.152853898087	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.433842237352	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.211315152876	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.22467098317	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.227293498252	...income tax...
0.0	0.914984621959	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.295782616282	No.
0.0	0.260825775352	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.457634061992	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.255613901951	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.137231836448	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.174023539586	Think about it.
0.0	0.164983790586	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.818387005827	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.228831749523	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
1.0	0.198673132722	They stole it.
0.0	0.37980915012	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.239661940314	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.142130977566	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.397446285651	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.292856662659	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.494942456924	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.243136070936	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.233417450726	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.251699819911	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.885169532962	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.147050566347	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.308771525831	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.183379819478	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.661255588197	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.352663824778	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.415689022315	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.183849526022	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.967991460163	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.114346749656	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.301843175921	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.156222353702	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.178742679284	Illegal.
0.0	0.190705922391	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.219940649062	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.611118694288	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.305659625063	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.13426547455	How do I know this?
0.0	0.755439978163	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.235496761526	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.485743282741	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.264798915639	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.6126473016	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.132513705411	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.367868782361	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
1.0	0.859940844644	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.213123304278	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.556547110921	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.0740946398055	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.551445429824	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.385332141903	I never said that.
0.0	0.188572067438	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.194581532719	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.21360569619	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.171436385196	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.730628441607	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.209666802377	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.757589208917	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
1.0	0.81651111655	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.524146219801	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.429216935291	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.232974503515	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.636983512354	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.247610824239	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.289135232667	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.240837662799	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.0918254279153	Thank you.
0.0	0.312765464553	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.238938404683	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.975322018897	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.148274426246	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.789119592655	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.298705473925	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.148209329918	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.445205385373	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
1.0	0.97058641965	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.768723676864	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.262499778711	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.517273238099	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
1.0	0.458265938474	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.271895381553	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.229663148738	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.163662987828	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.237678816128	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.772798437364	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.186379483039	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.343347968586	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.449424567924	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.138596597534	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.162561385328	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.165545972583	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.20822044445	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.191445225356	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.194593485823	It goes away.
0.0	0.159934857387	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.0899869179085	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.381851854446	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.265819340374	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.698480116464	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.175914339663	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.374812227711	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.486497782476	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.687045260952	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.360709362395	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.333744215008	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.349171912906	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.45409098827	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.745122033941	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.253221326915	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.209932302943	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.68243681225	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.

0.0	0.568526741104	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.619591485377	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.137811614129	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.420450420247	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.459546320228	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.127165731716	But they can't get along.

0.0	0.20403723111	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.219432890366	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.3539270705	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.601263469613	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.884982153115	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.301200575571	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.582443007811	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.315259485904	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.233387179993	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.54335608083	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.635399251425	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.277959467908	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.099718225841	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.175710236509	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.283828327798	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.231522516193	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.869174106312	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.291493807838	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.453787337651	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.27772262835	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.21629914081	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.338087103161	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.416212942499	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.295782616282	No.
0.0	0.150048306314	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.154709381631	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.5	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.237888772575	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.407627568285	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.457072824177	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.149858024692	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.136029575964	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.359261969621	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.0809509142651	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.214802932168	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.162096637675	Our next president...
0.0	0.297867052607	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.5	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.696961119981	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.12441901793	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.943722906618	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.234894859094	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.219808331606	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.365845969893	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.196037725371	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.254462498434	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.129247368333	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.226967010208	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.332243195597	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.267782640665	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.165532181234	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.105983065406	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.971690887359	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.415178558358	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.702626414783	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
1.0	0.624767386934	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.470291830301	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
1.0	0.869893387883	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.292216063626	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.428342878127	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.0974376384134	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.155936451103	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.403422286136	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.619781505241	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.349316453193	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.422311350308	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.423289362272	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.609932602749	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.132928571548	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.092368784202	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.3162965628	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.257271368393	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.229069613645	in particular.
0.0	0.187197271995	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.678312918042	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.218356511552	He is a good man.
0.0	0.137243563296	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.5	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.385916761413	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.633630471055	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.45849560026	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.336351604309	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.302034419059	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.196993379585	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.267754932768	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.232972952209	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.0955349403988	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.258657491604	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
1.0	0.238945176887	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.0666894063529	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.162817536358	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.696349137128	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.402229236357	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
1.0	0.651218317187	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.249872913804	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.190274642222	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.27878600252	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.221181402435	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.363860564966	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.387331390172	It was.
0.0	0.166845387013	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
1.0	0.971483872583	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.233187805756	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.204479268986	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.0877474181478	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.300049061008	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.403719354027	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.317078278734	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.520736964051	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.223647949768	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.1649038546	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.116750224815	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.181899719541	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.658812854453	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.220568648216	I like that.
0.0	0.945776216356	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.224774017107	And for good cause.
0.0	0.103122043368	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.20072948162	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.214900478167	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.0918254279153	Thank you.
0.0	0.213011452729	About Medicare?
0.0	0.115594109022	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.913580929979	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.796494482516	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.17517812359	I like it.
0.0	0.411866287437	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.23900914175	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.18996633435	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.188675014815	Alright.
0.0	0.551025402929	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.227131859662	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.531470882777	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.717633474121	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.15167265909	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.200654842695	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.184149674958	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.120902842117	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.165440038421	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.596390185985	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.79959795385	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.298548777306	That is our government today.
0.0	0.204395682303	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.36009208273	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.793786437788	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
1.0	0.873526419948	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.338943101716	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.19937552481	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.170293524549	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.255981206943	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.391264882292	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.217680688189	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.417055640866	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.428398480836	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.451766024584	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.234300780664	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.611506767806	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.789065827297	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.143377170581	That is important.
0.0	0.16658032954	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.259354804966	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.800219564272	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.0559988695518	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.52732421062	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.273214220169	Why?
0.0	0.288242877079	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.869185928107	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.566141117414	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.309174101563	Why is that?
0.0	0.265405904287	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.176056684439	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.127399943033	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.131242076171	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.249400679771	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.160117060651	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
1.0	0.776187631349	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.166625595083	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.272536112119	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.409712862913	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.20886446649	That's the difference.
0.0	0.387938846785	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.135712035183	And you know what?
0.0	0.62073275034	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.148141373262	We don't win.
0.0	0.132086387156	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.468424364269	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.224282244928	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.225476222574	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.666071722758	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.662994422083	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.523136855159	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.927739066703	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.162998232588	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.622023025383	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.235930273591	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.182375012047	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.593294933644	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.167159582295	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.311111978909	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.1601149808	You just want to...
0.0	0.354667957413	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.19591514342	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.24287476079	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.233284065087	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.234246877454	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.294828330054	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.382645485797	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.37010933689	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.354591967831	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.224436686023	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.563679912044	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.455972494189	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.327868368871	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.362610727006	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.608668719422	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.293336011796	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.774965646236	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.424881089778	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.80313632524	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.407777119933	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.868515008157	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.173190979735	You can't do that to the party.
1.0	0.72803958134	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.3162965628	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.744253823199	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.0632502596367	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.17527387681	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.157804126286	Yeah.
0.0	0.160811580483	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.257549474563	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.338699466668	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.868855847721	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.435052075225	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.21360569619	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.453362504814	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.261716946206	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.466809489343	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.195806644313	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.666893238145	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.296551854455	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
1.0	0.989719859981	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.258530914584	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.968421291207	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.200872045666	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.391917441661	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.531535976519	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.245449987127	So...
0.0	0.702388840287	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.156087365486	(inaudible).
0.0	0.38027717431	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.248846525905	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
1.0	0.434079964643	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.73664509223	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.645193916173	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.27005809585	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.386801266029	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.1633620305	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.63573683897	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.160679256815	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.650757004733	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.237120312122	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.356122436288	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.506519075787	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.399578255654	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.206819670086	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.225256886365	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.400194711149	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.291035267276	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.651414799207	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.269766592762	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.680461841163	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.247846567087	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.0881508533363	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.290517993375	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.195983797454	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.459299681928	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.106468678215	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.721155214128	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.32894111905	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.281889754342	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.18224746412	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.235530685663	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.48002984017	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.240519035741	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.437893381864	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.418590484453	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.210493129445	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.955737628514	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.364040820181	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.25039203211	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.474816389523	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.104849316536	...Chris...
0.0	0.655801283291	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.354207892207	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.13480390629	He undermines it.
0.0	0.396030416999	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.

0.0	0.134483138733	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.541465405971	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.201566190065	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.463017336487	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.395899963952	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.701464526904	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.839359502988	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.171793834552	We're running.
0.0	0.308806452906	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.415380007879	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.277939449113	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.246878189384	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.617965390066	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.204383499099	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.20444814139	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.845165124504	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.149004180434	They don't like that.
0.0	0.433193751832	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.256312399384	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.163464147161	John.
0.0	0.139265805082	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.1857281055	Think about that.
0.0	0.668201266796	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.716220296487	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.263211366162	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.257206816496	So we have a disagreement on this.
1.0	0.794160713651	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.228824551671	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.486052845494	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.268836578963	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.297158099811	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.492456848577	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.199321232114	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.308067553066	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.140835576443	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.0916407173458	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.464692679784	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.301696996889	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.694108429276	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.545148935085	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.135712035183	And you know what?
0.0	0.219694233851	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.120342516374	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.369714176799	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.37471648555	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.647648704729	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.408938337636	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.132605563328	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.289735381593	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.346141824276	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.691912115418	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.232641147295	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.461424198368	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.11816693563	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.209852072727	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.381505565109	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.465381602649	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.553326515641	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.154709381631	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.743667426381	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.27122957478	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.159018198276	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.687501353948	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.576425352817	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.123001725801	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.337779872609	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.251528452087	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.620529181264	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.485375281147	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.308000295302	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.188750967744	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.252256688681	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.675493506055	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.570955419864	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.396921405609	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.195753792913	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.248477835475	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.551829483499	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.316021775055	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.237310125211	I want security.
0.0	0.521936928345	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.174406698053	You really can't.
0.0	0.166840768309	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.529476934286	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.645122999505	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.151066348229	You're welcome.
0.0	0.318441898197	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.123556506592	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.833871415182	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.310065991488	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.386528771883	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.167804716203	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.254015586115	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.352008598303	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.459894235003	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.373649491909	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.723329308277	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.220130618065	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.354338238977	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.543615763756	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.919934658721	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.208186347582	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.173412409547	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.549895762205	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.141648716932	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.151308793971	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.917334609075	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.339918511761	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.682587028293	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.691713455957	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.453653633558	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.239549459114	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.262671856146	We cannot be the world's policeman.
1.0	0.944297538165	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.39004484069	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
1.0	0.692484109453	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.355758329141	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.390028154078	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.208446802919	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.574415440699	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.273705515661	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
1.0	0.130435366751	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
1.0	0.706545950711	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.154160814553	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.511316175554	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.446439323451	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.227661435426	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.428286806032	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.202228558328	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.798983561637	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.554509123712	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.44233799727	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.229221365157	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.221158778503	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.368142508806	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.278230685107	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.0918254279153	Thank you.
0.0	0.163464147161	John?
0.0	0.211662180613	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.43243854902	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.354189950159	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.157440638367	Wait for what?
0.0	0.289342729212	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.272114889304	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.387967355329	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.189828611912	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.14579524471	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.12713025341	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.38218489967	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.404517915609	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.222817451988	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.921017908264	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
1.0	0.51510882786	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.175477536711	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.284207708097	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.347600215421	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.198137422318	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.376086693722	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.133330471598	He does great.
0.0	0.175009005591	slot.
0.0	0.222569444585	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.135885701269	We haven't.
0.0	0.177654361939	Creativity.
0.0	0.161970811645	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.134126804661	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.801377284294	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.201217585746	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.6671207307	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.18207891273	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.579384847054	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.182656604901	My background is different.
0.0	0.677915243238	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.368968327741	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.

0.0	0.227148830724	And why?
0.0	0.272800770746	No their not.
0.0	0.318774009801	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
1.0	0.827807100947	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.23274304931	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.431652326756	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.0915121977885	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.419489546848	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.105075180637	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.338493465388	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.113864118027	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.17237705749	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.172990682684	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.683838574678	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
1.0	0.677898835846	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.158920666423	That's what we need.
0.0	0.103094258429	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.465560963614	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.437785380246	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.446324901907	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.151861932321	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.191778646081	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.129723159634	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.880834372002	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.381033893153	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.321048788378	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.901133721037	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.462657831991	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.0820767065911	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.237220660813	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.396577766064	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.114677057751	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.632940694548	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.604767283742	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.320265644098	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.900364634676	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.399476268926	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.489498550078	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.562183064014	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
1.0	0.903605219682	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.213205050884	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.184051518328	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
1.0	0.602639711625	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.275107420172	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.288072004491	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.113109705681	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.708090770142	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.411000112109	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
1.0	0.656180201274	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.166045491663	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.828176816214	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.31836915075	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.385332141903	I never said that.
0.0	0.121687321664	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.656444775618	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.4214887999	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.288612739457	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.231784900093	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.118211081829	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.154960588937	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.161555384647	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.622667043514	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.213029945712	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
1.0	0.969779483543	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.613380383767	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.236515549651	...
0.0	0.485288182173	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.608660975041	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.235476123773	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.277404341825	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.11590699964	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.585979554068	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.164764907563	And so do I.
1.0	0.780757121213	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.974903309176	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.620582644354	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.188128284924	He has never defended...
0.0	0.304160466076	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.

0.0	0.130008524246	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.873594223137	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.181082466008	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.

0.0	0.133692644922	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.275109681629	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.558714058355	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.190451531794	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.70626555766	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.350734674932	You know why three?

0.0	0.525579730445	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.272068677549	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.

0.0	0.514845919828	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.213197368677	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.64140009533	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.238581946619	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.412922579877	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.585632354111	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.162820082861	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.292710072546	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.223222503075	That's right.
0.0	0.53804950044	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.387263183897	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.245678133932	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.515645699962	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.216818197561	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.154204864525	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.757935504978	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.509498832648	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.144253061946	Can we stop?
0.0	0.274335294177	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.172230082183	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.580474817604	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.230319168276	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.327918434275	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.386218274331	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.236009020836	And here's why.
0.0	0.119917445122	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.725724895747	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.205621461303	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.155197581854	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.198481578783	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.357452045769	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.366431198681	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.306726810784	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.12510777584	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.123521873719	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.372677697421	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.0481061521368	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.111987986774	...No, sir...
0.0	0.27778524793	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.220287770807	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.145588260724	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.213862990283	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.5	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.365701365076	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.180436056134	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.241503296453	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.293098952145	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.771790496044	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.359545222341	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.70253842643	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.590796239596	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.295029087397	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.329160512867	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.376511360522	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.564216593957	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.192514417156	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.622937030391	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.413515801882	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.44227993037	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.0918254279153	Thank you.
0.0	0.168640035408	That's not right.
0.0	0.200941037163	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
1.0	0.758957223929	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.42406014663	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.307907431329	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.173360440002	They're off to China.
0.0	0.200592984665	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.625409998718	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.151755638242	But I know who the pessimist is.
1.0	0.923000357638	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.546437062341	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.537794063035	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.483004167007	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.209093469668	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.308123207951	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.49033007152	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.401290027749	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.887955219676	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.195206007897	But...
0.0	0.253881404533	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.322013609182	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.123002060353	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.5	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
1.0	0.39238334931	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.406146775753	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.587726534914	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.69185792278	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.0931083183419	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.517478788233	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.147665082798	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.313134679716	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.199910548494	That's a dictatorship.

0.0	0.62045378155	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.491951303029	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.295782616282	No.
0.0	0.567865311409	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.635118770617	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.321952684365	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.340808284842	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.848836681345	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.192988386541	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.847599767759	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.

0.0	0.736579498358	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.5	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.852616531002	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.

0.0	0.0918254279153	Thank you.
0.0	0.257031946172	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.

0.0	0.569336235074	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.709062562197	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.343519037933	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.

0.0	0.320125002583	You can't grow your way out of demographics.

0.0	0.135659546223	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.18277086152	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.258426023968	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.779425321811	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.412372422506	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.6721303472	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.135712035183	But you know what?
0.0	0.271720435247	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.0802756806521	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.358495077301	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.205956292443	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.478623683796	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
1.0	0.874041183779	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
1.0	0.828199941822	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.354829490504	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.283749020216	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.523366219708	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.160295482565	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.292051292646	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.624782638745	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.317328989205	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.106975767338	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.181433527524	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.0811509387238	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.748525670347	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.334583947082	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.817387796065	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.188553748253	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.308844627611	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.545995930931	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.105946042402	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.0826302322887	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.611341539628	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.236866655278	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.298730420902	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.285818144109	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.696961119981	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.123774663278	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.318684489688	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.207800594798	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.223233975192	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.533857091769	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.35132177289	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.76911700792	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.486908837127	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.333755351656	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.288940834534	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.475998123133	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.199750051495	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.102509481668	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.128594294288	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.16546786521	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.876043163941	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.316263275059	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.458404702646	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.138872978094	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.142362432984	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.276887172226	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.211094975769	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.515878600548	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.259359099048	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.610721733835	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.971098561236	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.189900036778	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.16920707639	OK?
0.0	0.299107684012	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.176027429985	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.185322836532	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.122401614013	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.242680182951	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.423814416209	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.305371842961	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.241719016212	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.723060446036	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.184305509249	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.414820756837	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.142948155234	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.823120830835	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.194761660924	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.812042079435	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.268348554064	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.251838654267	This country is changing.
0.0	0.646969191224	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.553348678461	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.437549429231	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.328989094957	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
1.0	0.355267599913	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.172587955218	I think he is right.
0.0	0.214048360167	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
1.0	0.860833105674	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.512242043185	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.34133917416	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.605479397429	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
1.0	0.464133019838	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.381254221496	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.820041734364	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.143761407377	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.0695992451109	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.111070956293	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.198096122007	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.45245988697	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.180888310992	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.290379556482	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.0954500906601	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.199458343651	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.31350219464	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.129736688629	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.117593574593	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.254279134723	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.857020711732	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.230077537238	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.323232629159	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.416651429783	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.5	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.251881188012	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.29216778238	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.698484698361	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.5	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.289120944471	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.395354710574	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.781470215058	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.199055716599	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.381893704644	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.245003099733	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.781468162305	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.769884013585	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.493015992962	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.760725446957	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.774774228368	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
1.0	0.573273671013	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.384979763172	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.597452902882	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.286808037334	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.385582737369	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.196879663772	Right.
0.0	0.128709896675	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.374666174587	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.295782616282	No.
0.0	0.614951740959	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.256961767641	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.132569203311	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.427739695493	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.378157980905	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.527703526777	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.511122194211	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.349799344905	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.451994801721	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.412806227935	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.185039699304	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.280518072557	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.541000323276	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.616494666113	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.347571394167	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.182432577167	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.131806006095	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.671215292014	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.549425697026	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.143216756275	He's wrong.
0.0	0.634992723726	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.432743689935	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.193108796193	It never happens.
0.0	0.0809509142651	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.915917202092	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.317559933584	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.376442919553	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.205441297981	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.125424315611	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.30952181335	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.16321011106	Say again?
0.0	0.605126955829	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.403362948878	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.228153145654	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.203547842946	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.300078208995	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.871071626736	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.424532347599	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.311539645201	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.371548737052	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.190010581984	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.5	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.682359248245	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.788962996433	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.979172050959	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.27760982891	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.218240972893	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.24723126297	These...
0.0	0.217644250029	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.331360939206	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.25534563253	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.390583748704	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.906673984211	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.25508477793	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.291528334386	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.17301254814	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.309168035799	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.387757769404	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.167723867575	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.396118178471	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.61329292523	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.5	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.53714922782	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.681097723496	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.108857929395	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.455920172508	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.311193483405	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.171013724447	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.214124558141	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.222494836167	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.681488028075	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.655370787675	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.199782431108	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.53222953948	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.114142350239	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.21470615568	They're a scam.
0.0	0.30606084749	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.591099961064	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.577641772606	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.103295897878	But I would add this.
0.0	0.31447915576	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.129851912718	You have to lead.
0.0	0.703698010121	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.779061078088	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.178523765903	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.620350290789	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.183900215978	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.343965006011	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.244896005544	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.243752333038	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.388001871642	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.150417796219	We don't need that.
0.0	0.285250333275	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.360198369255	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.260591596709	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.714586676322	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.419010952387	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.165176761004	I can.
0.0	0.55740955456	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.451145587174	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.318774026252	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.128748421525	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.191828395594	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.087921990459	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.592167730753	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.820797181842	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.263200288084	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.174063952015	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.426673513085	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.511851033735	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.270435019976	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.146749967451	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.739528603839	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.334296335214	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.161930616879	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.0877811278253	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.16997123706	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.253611705534	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.199266832302	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.314392265414	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.375659940591	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.195206007897	And...
0.0	0.80197088884	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.271939323054	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.157558905166	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.111896194214	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.328013720773	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.544010417754	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.155429389535	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.159056651067	I understand.
0.0	0.405017953927	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.357408441739	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.261772776203	You do.
0.0	0.152657030843	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.182711805989	You're right.
0.0	0.270675479114	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.476454019926	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.093189071414	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.195853773428	You looking at me?
0.0	0.405420441773	Never been done before, never been done since.
1.0	0.882057498032	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.136662840851	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.100500199985	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.265966764236	I was the architect.
0.0	0.187119783114	Yes.
0.0	0.268400743146	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.250499592495	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.342862018467	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.245569469268	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.657820270724	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.445019315067	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.247564622614	In all due respect...
0.0	0.297872816569	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.788743686956	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.146258254614	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.206042502589	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.0949063002251	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.454849093821	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.626059675725	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.476966075282	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.154004431434	I win.
0.0	0.310836669563	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.194287937846	That will change everything.
0.0	0.252256688681	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.230962169396	We need sound money.
0.0	0.307852534718	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.520930875684	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.523435069558	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.5	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
1.0	0.364765682745	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.376211997836	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.803874684583	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.521755176466	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.39958963122	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.449706364273	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.486611898497	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.177228797696	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.305741137676	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.299355210107	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.264790011887	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.47506912776	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.525919503457	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
1.0	0.89115619998	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.821474824131	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.409101868071	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.620075168915	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.215139998755	You know that.
0.0	0.303583630696	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.412296635154	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.14976761619	I'm ready.
0.0	0.375236763996	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.644780826392	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.15608257987	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.337236662511	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.338844578261	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.900630008434	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.269821857222	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.603960273071	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.129994683137	You find me...
0.0	0.106091337052	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.868855847721	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.148587635299	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.312198882679	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.156179284847	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.633588769943	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.270078471207	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.428285730223	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.434924301172	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.159056919528	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.157973757631	I promise.
0.0	0.284817058607	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.264329472951	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.270630289838	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.305039244749	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.336285284022	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
1.0	0.965628462711	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.288825142093	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.295338004965	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.472143283092	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.558088402801	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.176023918516	And God bless America.
0.0	0.802679863656	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.383732489044	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.300477986199	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.134487901372	I can do that.
0.0	0.151884863299	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.521099980251	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.246165916154	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.173325661334	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.185109774707	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.573993853543	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.556758810871	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.631556549023	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.221191912793	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.609718667261	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.597732088255	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.110452534217	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.728722122529	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.168551616515	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.283297545442	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.237619409384	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.180904889384	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.107693564842	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.456761198142	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.295782616282	No.
0.0	0.271202704321	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.254942215998	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.510899275506	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.721716508668	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.22193994823	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.361756428769	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.11962881841	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.225794438658	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.436315954119	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.408582984531	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
1.0	0.41443205589	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.299973779803	She voted for it.
0.0	0.414158737073	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.320035164207	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.208831869886	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.345682632862	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.232842009745	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.211644688146	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.160679944883	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.197133288573	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.470742063001	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.165215044078	You know why?
0.0	0.312783140018	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.895055713522	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.52246302968	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.567104990997	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.935790032258	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.516705398282	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.38048809267	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.175987297772	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.17235033903	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.352907750928	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.731711989574	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.543874109844	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.405436272711	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.216626987978	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.445748782702	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.0900166197537	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.5	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.186347469211	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.135496326084	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.372529051486	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.0769900170229	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.234024438057	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.492649282315	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
1.0	0.870222061387	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.24847323799	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.241009854687	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.352717756534	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.0918254279153	Thank you.
0.0	0.342154666736	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.174230004496	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.246089457803	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.16048099374	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.33501059969	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.355976994074	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.304307849609	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.176319871983	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.290805876689	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.117860268805	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.275694086831	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.441788824961	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.21866150176	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.193073091334	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.72887488242	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
1.0	0.647606732054	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.669419515888	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.248880942976	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.338596206083	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.194922176794	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.233628137614	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.188664611304	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.323424560698	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.065232996495	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.208137304191	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.215608588031	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.347462810499	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.519474249441	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.238996045419	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.982978489255	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.185677304921	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.177899601854	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.0698375787367	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.141129748723	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.192988386541	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.1013235751	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.580970992728	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.10409244977	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
1.0	0.657081273893	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.119197165242	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.192730011806	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.157345799351	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.161645240523	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.309730925615	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.242858733668	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.411464751087	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.538020233065	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.124238507582	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.313552825238	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.831724510847	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.0941572087355	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.130707316416	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.212045900278	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.928415854703	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.248405216184	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.262421143873	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.143916121894	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.36966786318	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.178057864226	Absolutely.
0.0	0.236441554497	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.655660958184	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.321242059154	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.24620387538	On welfare.
0.0	0.129383345487	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
1.0	0.923717690245	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.715449563674	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.248650464881	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.284815095459	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.491244707727	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.572006090227	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.168724924341	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.162147555361	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.308604750351	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.185128967247	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.147417398081	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.291319952399	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.193531288971	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.295950788052	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.632066321265	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.240122295569	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.124315876846	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.18493026695	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.165334809812	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.153203528318	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.210445227962	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.138798853361	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.372639784989	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.181953878781	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.279166242839	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.231549046149	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.309099084666	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.5	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.651910190555	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.234989833502	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.339660268825	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.868325793138	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.118850437754	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.124602739291	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.192425211896	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.308604750351	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
1.0	0.465516591796	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.461988399793	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.807715541988	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.135902137322	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.388796214566	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.233546352745	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.695573980329	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.225458244655	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.201660140608	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.20179265533	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.938174413754	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.0888409462336	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.197440320612	But I was born here.
0.0	0.124674352034	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.331357837288	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.664492112564	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.292558412136	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.56224861409	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.228544982245	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.553069476743	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.732949723096	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.286906632657	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.206861864316	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.836611002235	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.454604231737	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.168938291642	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.79385030098	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.303817124441	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.375920004979	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.12510777584	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.264273683698	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.173537580792	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.488440997146	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.426840195889	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.904489744719	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.599517924201	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.444095917911	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.81902555559	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.233230397703	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.277877335541	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.247934442543	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.241111718436	We need security.
0.0	0.821522695256	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.593959056763	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.318966942033	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.719729403112	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.464800332174	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.316428685671	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.727376801786	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.165900968949	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.116419107503	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.278826951996	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.701411458265	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.455992074253	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.876082990421	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.32257333535	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.738941340378	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.98835043923	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.255898328835	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.385332141903	I never said that.
0.0	0.644824667798	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.352966861641	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.397193194277	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.204774960492	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.378189343016	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.593264820838	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.230471414793	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.5	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.529006664154	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.53455569802	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.395463020127	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.164440822439	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.759467967858	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.16920707639	OK?
0.0	0.505939976489	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.5	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.22899410831	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.689767406309	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.125840130493	I think you're --
0.0	0.766062013359	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.100338863482	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.129444106751	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.849968251517	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.448135717369	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.273896958997	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.133961165994	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.186023168408	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.388652515852	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.174023539586	Think about it.
0.0	0.604767283742	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0673967971517	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.423339512521	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.727367403431	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.642473755167	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.525046260438	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.909196824588	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.411661827417	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.240813835937	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.851420179768	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.267619250186	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.359249505744	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.0460790512627	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.700225569563	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
1.0	0.976174373078	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.393419568709	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.588420001716	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.812222993821	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.14809429582	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.807083873895	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.592805286153	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.1385274872	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.375929478383	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.0918254279153	Thank you.
0.0	0.598202105238	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.390932787091	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.617108220708	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.291419659707	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.535764399064	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.709670455548	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.179774786322	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.135712035183	And you know what?
0.0	0.230962169396	We need sound money.
0.0	0.17237593658	They know.
0.0	0.183532360107	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.5	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.224950794675	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.239640171298	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.154161414951	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.692799652461	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.775343901153	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.300263273667	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.412632018051	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.176646175038	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.378218857154	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.221798210424	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.207479662378	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.407666818702	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.173234034357	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.310984494267	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.196176023374	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.125482964399	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.236951631183	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.317952053413	What have you got now?
0.0	0.674667577987	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.505525181455	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.24006811281	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.421386966627	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.30780907294	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.431240595449	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.321085235652	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.65239466721	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.60893683152	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.457151194747	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.727216758678	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.175818201797	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.365219890148	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.250364650203	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.295782616282	No.
0.0	0.346721715241	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.22950454853	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.459707476035	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.13543494659	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.816589802624	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.47540816083	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.682585228407	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.146856503831	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.645933095096	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.520404523309	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.301398067961	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.203597003159	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.480666945564	I was not at all.
0.0	0.5	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.698027100403	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.208215381659	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.176217647874	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.184966641883	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.379555830735	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.135712035183	And you know what?
