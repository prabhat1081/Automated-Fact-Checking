0.0	0.331994572703	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
0.0	0.447018768866	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.

0.0	0.291486214169	You have a bigger problem with China.
0.0	0.564182141801	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.

0.0	0.4410676865	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.557084622307	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.263297825626	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.0183224443913	OK.
0.0	0.234652585531	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.163630479255	No, I think they won't.
0.0	0.0384726996819	Creativity.
0.0	0.338943645611	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.393154267032	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.434908458204	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.459545945431	We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York.
0.0	0.119917138967	I agree completely.
0.0	0.305180063194	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.299822202967	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.463326363501	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.403696015854	I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism --
0.0	0.415502576652	They want American troops back in the Middle East.
0.0	0.522914971084	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.369225056588	When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.
0.0	0.364860592342	And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave.
0.0	0.556712627408	We also have to build a coalition at home.
0.0	0.904454749899	Do it.
0.0	0.21833784454	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.399818042084	So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.
0.0	0.353836525469	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.359474751473	Our country has tremendous potential.
0.0	0.112867958182	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.262539689862	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.439917296549	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.585431201064	I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.
0.0	0.472816471378	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
0.0	0.5	The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.
0.0	0.440023718643	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.564561914317	I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.
0.0	0.454657920224	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.137294798784	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.415845729736	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.322166633542	Secondly, we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.
0.0	0.631206275962	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.0527229480895	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.396913723563	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.34594509108	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.0144865637252	Chris...
0.0	0.184520474432	Good evening.
0.0	0.365136390886	So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there.
0.0	0.5	Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes.
0.0	0.200984220692	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.342783783575	Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging.
0.0	0.593326813346	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.591963294245	And so, look, the way that -- a stronger middle class is actually the source of economic growth.
0.0	0.14909580367	Look at my family.
0.0	0.14131576304	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.493541306304	We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground."
0.0	0.358326891717	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.441785937552	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.551626928414	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
0.0	0.250959077812	We have people that don't have it.
0.0	0.134095569102	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.126175512849	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.185636418039	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.638387280489	Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.
0.0	0.562222060056	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.49340329917	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
1.0	0.889798476273	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.311576147203	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.0636789862204	Here's what I believe.
0.0	0.243188210367	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.614768493145	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.187767496047	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.457642082395	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.353458102736	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.309314955097	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.367111300522	Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting...
0.0	0.25571978996	But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says.
0.0	0.289559371992	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.39655520279	We have a stock market that is so bloated.
0.0	0.0635456009822	That's what we believe in.
0.0	0.184158647276	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
0.0	0.344408528495	That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.
0.0	0.00838809744736	I was for legalization.
0.0	0.316374414971	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.
0.0	0.461894145664	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
0.0	0.372305779817	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
0.0	0.34568078801	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.244411947673	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.353541117611	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.440815254969	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.293811373163	I'd suggest people take a look at it.
0.0	0.163840662761	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.18542187193	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.442409435205	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.374176909428	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.138469455478	That's a drag on the economy.
0.0	0.194579045801	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.192877412311	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.342591778059	That's not even an issue.
1.0	0.455812744221	They were wrong.
1.0	0.622192169254	We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.568899320796	And that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity -- kill people who are unarmed who should not be killed, they must be held accountable.
0.0	0.58338435698	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.546108064813	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.5	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.41375483813	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.247340763964	We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?
0.0	0.243621561288	Our president doesn't have a clue.
0.0	0.0531509676626	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.354635993577	You can go to my website...
1.0	0.699144515467	In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.
0.0	0.444346651739	It's a divided country on guns.
0.0	0.5	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.438997779456	... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record.
0.0	0.245679024508	... issues they have to respond to.
0.0	0.5	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.280133106849	At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida.
0.0	0.386356122405	Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.
0.0	0.563274758762	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.304247300573	But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said.
0.0	0.432855780572	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.120580402016	Believe me, folks.
0.0	0.380588404909	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.296364483156	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.524019020997	But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.0919041779468	We have no borders.

0.0	0.00441573672568	Martha, thank you.

0.0	0.510255795402	I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.

0.0	0.138546424469	We have the opposite thinking.

0.0	0.138940135744	We are rebuilding China.
0.0	0.584683822549	My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt.

0.0	0.466405645625	We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America.
0.0	0.216594432409	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.

0.0	0.385796019318	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.376703962722	We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.
0.0	0.507977449799	I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.
0.0	0.413628970262	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.441553957942	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.431191775725	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
0.0	0.350143834626	I don't think a halt is necessary.

0.0	0.46342558825	When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war.
0.0	0.378259126639	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.0731548356075	And we have nothing.
0.0	0.337919162771	They say, " well, we don't really have control."

0.0	0.253884987401	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.0264989736223	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.323346153933	And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country.
0.0	0.251169748904	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
0.0	0.176352546211	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.536579124791	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.547830195908	... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.530278888325	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.100126979714	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
0.0	0.372709255329	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.178318174112	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.
0.0	0.0297125818697	Yes.
0.0	0.15211097883	The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans.
0.0	0.0733068122175	We have nothing.
0.0	0.0756889487142	She did it for convenience.
0.0	0.469820038562	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.332918137646	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.52303352027	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.275853734134	Well, I've got news for you, we can.
0.0	0.0144865637252	Chris?
0.0	0.25985354347	Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.
0.0	0.36801643876	Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
0.0	0.37413232732	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
0.0	0.395343809707	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.364206285116	Two points.
0.0	0.168339500253	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.185313579256	So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
0.0	0.486417587761	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.137047452779	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.07947741458	A step forward.
0.0	0.485833700449	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.
0.0	0.287307129598	He thinks low wages are a good idea.
0.0	0.507249376805	If we are not successful, if we continue the same old, same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big-money interests, nothing changes.
0.0	0.52243366044	And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.
0.0	0.440910729867	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.383525526307	Rebuild the country's infrastructure.
0.0	0.291845677693	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.573822193605	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.206903811024	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
1.0	0.355614129953	They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us.
0.0	0.292588324051	You can go to opensecrets.org and check that.
0.0	0.126607017114	All right.
0.0	0.434377892721	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.321548181704	Just for the record.
0.0	0.203044644849	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.349388636214	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.422561698778	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.

0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.422926137587	We will see what the American people are willing to support.
0.0	0.201485986532	Let me just say this...
0.0	0.281357095377	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
1.0	0.751015459938	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.470786811289	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.401157884092	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.267056357061	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
1.0	0.392289764888	We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.
0.0	0.53360753956	I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan.
0.0	0.379262676235	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.574308065966	And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.
0.0	0.588349460035	Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system.
0.0	0.275015738417	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.271559041368	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.0297125818697	Yes.
0.0	0.542152551438	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.299398328328	Just can't happen.
0.0	0.567533885524	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.373671382309	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.368702233295	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.35823151716	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.90367753751	How do we do it?"
0.0	0.30487160436	She is not qualified to be President of the United States.
0.0	0.309416320806	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
0.0	0.179583370779	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.429223477894	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.661773401423	And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.
0.0	0.404270940311	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.
0.0	0.125778038233	I am glad Donald is running.
0.0	0.284774368187	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.

0.0	0.230356987434	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.652904434955	Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military.
0.0	0.443553191673	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.259098081181	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.488787666014	Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple.
0.0	0.128354546411	I don't want it."
0.0	0.322616110353	And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.
0.0	0.126348418247	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.654561759645	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.163703235259	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.062782127949	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.216015405181	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.429161261725	I -- I believe that we should make community college free.
0.0	0.00195495673065	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.203037245136	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.331835081649	... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...
1.0	0.763800277124	I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians.
0.0	0.492527281648	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.0183224443913	OK...
0.0	0.505309751291	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.185934604598	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.587243922319	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.620651332661	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.191893421525	That means everything.
0.0	0.286974880167	We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
0.0	0.536281548622	If the United States does not lead, there is not another leader.
0.0	0.179692266424	But it's a lot safer.

0.0	0.465783340934	Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that's not good enough.
0.0	0.408209056725	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.

0.0	0.606111989064	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.0887209980837	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.262563239439	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.506428336326	And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to.
0.0	0.18672107519	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.548722897468	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.469249198506	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.0874245752015	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.424691867205	The biggest bank in the world is from China.
0.0	0.262804682915	What part is valid?
0.0	0.644944767497	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.279706960487	I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.43150126758	Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.
0.0	0.292667972347	And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?
0.0	0.43541449942	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.167101347202	I've faced it.
0.0	0.428402927085	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.365537773888	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.212571898977	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.126607017114	All right.
0.0	0.557144094972	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.235969805651	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.22469705553	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.350376679049	Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.
0.0	0.0351829090803	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.349725154609	It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.
0.0	0.47736801103	I spent a lot of time in the situation room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us.
0.0	0.55321547318	We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.
0.0	0.126458572473	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.494231803417	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
0.0	0.260687735678	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.339978519342	We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
0.0	0.0502147256846	That was a terrible mistake.
0.0	0.347251507241	They are not doing it now.
0.0	0.550354138807	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.131611311572	And I think this is an important question.
0.0	0.349174467541	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.367696512727	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.439524450074	So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.
0.0	0.471796438746	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.555864851452	Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.
0.0	0.477387892473	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.204110047619	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.563349633765	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.5	Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.
0.0	0.430816961767	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.652964477921	We're spending over $600 billion a year on the military and yet, significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism.
0.0	0.560242597498	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.548501743069	But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks.
0.0	0.271313024679	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.263785145959	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.0422836986661	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.5	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.219406183954	Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth.
0.0	0.192194092316	$24 trillion.
0.0	0.143775264016	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.493935674115	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.289146589415	in particular.
0.0	0.313132171291	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.272778221135	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.591603272634	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.340582523966	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.395486494496	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.389128451453	He'll say, "Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico."
0.0	0.54188808489	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
1.0	0.938366935704	The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation.
0.0	0.239519522569	Everybody's for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.0146467873994	How stupid are they?
0.0	0.0123521917369	Excuse me.
0.0	0.374072577798	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.374058523063	How are they going to beat ISIS?
0.0	0.133118194601	And I believe he is absolutely right.
0.0	0.646985314301	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
0.0	0.146416732949	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.568725434266	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.480881787253	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
0.0	0.380107412	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.490846019156	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.582350611801	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
0.0	0.279726209584	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.314692291437	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.17231238418	They had a plan that was good.
0.0	0.391638946694	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.598329283549	States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government.
1.0	0.867613027279	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.45448615617	We need to have stronger families.
1.0	0.896937274516	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.336449900189	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.558565155298	We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress, but it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us.
0.0	0.516923487151	You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
0.0	0.140765549554	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.536579124791	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.363691884973	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.18968121386	It feels different.
0.0	0.529037374361	We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
0.0	0.159859391485	He's not a leader.
0.0	0.518347863479	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.219163128018	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.
0.0	0.438411981192	It's not just Wall Street.
0.0	0.342191285443	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.383313445798	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.516072346812	Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks -- between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance.
0.0	0.0292752212839	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.512336209232	And then on top of that, we've got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are pouring huge sums of money into super PACS heavily influencing the political process.
0.0	0.381830604666	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.316786665917	I do not believe in unilateral American action.
0.0	0.255947572024	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.379609751322	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.524158032874	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.402169844062	One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together.
0.0	0.347473511274	You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911.
0.0	0.156746461293	I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.
0.0	0.33943142554	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.
0.0	0.335892368996	And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.
0.0	0.185513716134	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.420995434218	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.0423769941588	How do I know this?
0.0	0.609324973371	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.507674952751	Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.
0.0	0.182278938397	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.251109181449	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.281852160102	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.0297125818697	Yes.
0.0	0.37340803167	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.470108553299	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.181160316442	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.237934775974	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.39598081527	And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.
0.0	0.298807789136	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.133768418116	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.554042638286	There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan.
0.0	0.571006059723	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.61435412746	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.457479017828	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
1.0	0.74508117903	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.600453091295	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.362150142967	White people?
0.0	0.445883116575	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.5	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.397397930102	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.195091724599	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.586920708696	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.516579029118	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.222820719632	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.00780144494113	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.145488430748	I think we all support it.
0.0	0.33323380799	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.554650772105	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.018145649112	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.409436946241	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.270208995734	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.
0.0	0.237136420218	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.369706241234	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.487121559154	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.187933169331	They started in Iowa.
0.0	0.441836862936	I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
0.0	0.623641246853	If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.
0.0	0.5	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.
0.0	0.172793342003	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.00416177474559	David, thank you.

0.0	0.53395621698	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.

0.0	0.60405947863	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.

1.0	0.847167280051	But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.

0.0	0.359514009615	In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.523041939089	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.392552147367	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.31706074659	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.904648168982	No.
0.0	0.567202881192	You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?
0.0	0.26995911196	Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice.
0.0	0.335554100795	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.

0.0	0.580914148998	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.203520528238	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.36388793238	Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
0.0	0.526783434873	And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young, old, everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard.
0.0	0.316183949693	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.228761777077	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.252899360985	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.410419525409	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.108972102188	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.0108298714373	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.160662802331	All of you in Iowa, I need you to caucus for me.
0.0	0.307365616593	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.128872880336	But he wasn't a cheerleader.
0.0	0.148307978481	That's my view.
0.0	0.137909980886	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.370801873079	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.351019527856	We're rebuilding many countries.
0.0	0.554541850275	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.182560426924	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.0269240646061	But, here is the truth.

0.0	0.0825263693545	They have no choice.
0.0	0.419283616476	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.255147074895	And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you're a governor.
0.0	0.431163012702	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.189817100371	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.313348693308	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.152733157212	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.547157420705	That is our government today.
0.0	0.385543584425	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.624239181155	What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security, through the State Department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening.
0.0	0.5	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.198834993934	... Chris, keep it coming...
0.0	0.444966156529	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.404056366578	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.432803611486	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.522168509279	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.127060961897	But the poll numbers have.

0.0	0.204691445745	We don't win.
0.0	0.25403675901	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.529213086757	And I have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run.
0.0	0.193499047468	Look, the secretary is right.
0.0	0.580213503299	Some of the bravest people that I had the privilege of working with as secretary of state were our development professionals who went sometimes alone, sometimes with our military, into very dangerous places in Iraq, in Afghanistan, elsewhere.
0.0	0.377078627164	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.904648168982	Again...
0.0	0.36685063913	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.
0.0	0.396172033328	In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...
0.0	0.0922795734987	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.382527640606	Well, you know, governor, I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010.
0.0	0.563749582371	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.5	It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them.

0.0	0.438380103502	When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.904454749899	And why?
0.0	0.0813948996392	...income tax...
0.0	0.239464316963	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.465421835861	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.121703294914	But -- but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages.
1.0	0.927753377293	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.296305521749	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.58204495538	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.39100162894	Since, you know, the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody.
0.0	0.355957060467	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.430379704194	And all over New Hampshire, I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose.
0.0	0.222976790207	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.12021114622	I have formed them.
0.0	0.618691543774	Reinstating Glass- Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough.
0.0	0.403690412046	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.315945830672	Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.
0.0	0.565639031262	Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.
0.0	0.368249856087	We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate.
0.0	0.0519687067408	OK, good.
0.0	0.309497245551	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.281523689892	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.679099350283	In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.
0.0	0.62819875902	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.305641626284	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.556033991209	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.42684480054	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.58083859524	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.56400866765	It wasn't the bill that I wanted, but yet it turned out to be one of the more significant pieces of veterans' legislation passed in recent history.
0.0	0.419994959455	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.330977085879	And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.
0.0	0.346230118722	All the time.
0.0	0.431834285629	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.277994745566	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.569498431239	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.195666045872	Ever.
0.0	0.156679792825	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.522885830939	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.0761424026864	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.156388647148	My name was invoked.
0.0	0.134196426511	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.129738190273	Megyn, that's the problem.
0.0	0.251758638378	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.285875368846	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.493750303885	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.318457276324	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.300255161816	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.302341858598	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.57381264164	And, I would not that there's a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that's the EPA's blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline.
0.0	0.597294486873	We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001.
0.0	0.19103431477	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.555913035361	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.
0.0	0.170075225113	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.311608469954	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
1.0	0.791324709315	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.137605377964	It's not working.
0.0	0.307063113064	Can we stop?
0.0	0.170828699372	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.301152031796	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.333183950026	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.411024005561	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.28282291457	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.368990148224	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.270119194928	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.345036940056	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.
0.0	0.367827523977	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.29330867815	I would like to see it updated.
0.0	0.904648168982	No.
0.0	0.313966545481	My wife, Jane, has been -- way back when before I knew her, a foster parent.
0.0	0.255276018189	You know, we had this incident before, Secretary, with your famous e-mails.
0.0	0.409519031065	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.239555249308	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.0279811254806	It's not great again.
0.0	0.208807787249	And that's not what's happening now.
0.0	0.269717430894	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.568426786398	We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.
0.0	0.424794306756	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.
0.0	0.206383531308	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.223502373196	I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.
1.0	0.0473338333792	They're rapists.
0.0	0.195730376658	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.0337397073033	He was a great negotiator.
0.0	0.195994329071	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.148372468167	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.408510612317	I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.
0.0	0.267879799672	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.246691536574	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.57734425405	And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years.
0.0	0.550912954091	This nation is the most powerful military in the world.
0.0	0.404979372388	Many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed.
0.0	0.484783949836	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.176523698085	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.445390373663	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.365400245713	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.429250387787	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.160680375118	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.471467858226	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.445748399588	You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet...
0.0	0.107142052685	We can't.
0.0	0.0987587063947	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.0695339476919	And that is what we have done in Ohio.
0.0	0.195477167518	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.342740158345	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.0953990759784	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.215439922636	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.358206720749	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.605818107742	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.330247845336	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.0967592504421	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.328330932515	From top to bottom.
0.0	0.226277209384	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.534013179934	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
0.0	0.368583962217	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.486669636276	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.0898964328274	It's not about Donald Trump.
0.0	0.270257418067	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.190882778984	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.177834790401	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.43940969401	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.0942287759587	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.340229147088	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.268194213267	He said, "You know, I make great product."
0.0	0.383719627667	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.598833017884	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.15122894099	So I said, "That's OK." I'm proud of my net worth.
0.0	0.471096695516	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.371663071373	No interest," because I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.164199224769	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.238426777821	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
0.0	0.0241153557272	And it has been amazing to me.
0.0	0.383506582674	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.485637209272	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.522975126325	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
0.0	0.0385602926805	She was a great CEO.

0.0	0.171920239738	They all want me to support them.
0.0	0.169889055483	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
1.0	0.903646922214	We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.
0.0	0.488140281916	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.
0.0	0.5	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.631122644011	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.0942868111037	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.406397183398	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.246466178623	It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.
0.0	0.337036201042	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.364101662376	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.0588958275593	Don't do it."
0.0	0.363706201501	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.0518252438346	I'm ready.
0.0	0.00885701491861	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.166164739061	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.492310146447	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.441036608911	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.289458441573	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.402208426727	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.515097318959	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.118878146756	Let me say this.
0.0	0.316426122893	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.
0.0	0.521714297944	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.143117135223	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.0295303248421	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.5	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.553574566046	Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it.
0.0	0.291172587665	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.265830012821	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.180182596291	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.648109427864	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.366567069697	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.583177744569	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.37649426157	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.446955462808	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.419394637028	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.466775370624	The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress.
0.0	0.474925089985	So I've said, if the big banks don't play by the rules, I will break them up.
0.0	0.611571747114	Paul Volcker, one of the leading lights of trying to reign in the excesses, has also said he does not support reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.0183224443913	OK.
0.0	0.359402100482	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.203545093326	And it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer.
0.0	0.436886268839	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.677960124594	It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.
0.0	0.511422744948	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.904648168982	2,000?
0.0	0.5	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.276110907362	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.5	And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.
0.0	0.603287320754	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.475510912282	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.180376564723	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.286455140653	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.563335257479	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.396822923317	The Libyans turned out for one of the most successful, fairest elections that any Arab country has had.
0.0	0.468977649823	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.173201813849	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.289592242766	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.186838010275	Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.
0.0	0.111999968363	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.267947000449	Enough said.
0.0	0.494566619814	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.571241853445	First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster.
0.0	0.446501522598	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.235478912085	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.90484123543	...
0.0	0.535592557992	You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent.
0.0	0.337748453853	We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be -- and -- and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody.
0.0	0.45108284633	We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it.
0.0	0.507590692897	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.31606313885	We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression.
0.0	0.607919620225	And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.
0.0	0.307803104188	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.540116193653	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.205562516234	Obama is going to be out playing golf.
0.0	0.431214266603	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.33723314195	They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
0.0	0.35444750427	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.513425618286	We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.
0.0	0.386631183135	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.366601187047	The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.
0.0	0.375047660798	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.41668310435	Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region.
0.0	0.214190820867	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
1.0	0.471730294495	We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
0.0	0.29648917176	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.305184991284	I think it's important we put this in historic context.
0.0	0.441951266485	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.603132831281	But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.
0.0	0.339570518817	You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future.
0.0	0.371509043346	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.179345501059	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.330655692562	So there's more to my plan than just the cap.
0.0	0.377377569094	In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill, "Well I assume Hillary has told you about this."
0.0	0.0680558818556	Nobody.
0.0	0.573924600608	Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground.
0.0	0.0183224443913	OK?
0.0	0.467437456956	And the world, no doubt is a better place without him.
0.0	0.515657522509	I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.
0.0	0.383071381097	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
0.0	0.623729471363	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.0981883765248	But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up.
0.0	0.364912854011	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.370497353117	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.480790221815	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.283675810259	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.365132335596	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.395873412514	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.35365927057	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.243178495274	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.237219327636	Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk.
0.0	0.365217173966	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.404272794234	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.408259111253	It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
0.0	0.488081389935	All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee.
0.0	0.232921826048	Because we need money.
0.0	0.612302203082	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.0297125818697	Yes.
1.0	0.759113706978	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.297919705488	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.
0.0	0.388895215819	We have got to come forward with a consensus that in fact will work.
0.0	0.489667791802	They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.401224139066	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.0811369532595	I've done it.
0.0	0.385563481092	and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States.
0.0	0.376046216151	Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process.
0.0	0.0707310601	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.418905192947	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.547805041234	We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.
0.0	0.5	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.379547216771	ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.
0.0	0.90484123543	...
0.0	0.344342025683	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.363477246956	Well, I got it for two reasons.
0.0	0.420447642298	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.24100452783	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.396513722046	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.213608208189	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.32915421873	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.681848100248	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.238526559755	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.469717858085	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.0540770704679	I think any parent would be so proud of them.
0.0	0.697598557797	In fact, American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the National Institute of Health and that we then tested through the FDA.
0.0	0.397248713435	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.5	And now many of these candidates want to cut it.
0.0	0.245020623052	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.90484123543	...
0.0	0.163454080911	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.362278072776	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.227057484053	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.424650551771	They don't want to raise the minimum wage, they don't want to do anything to increase incomes.
0.0	0.439656565184	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.415156173524	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
0.0	0.396853178351	When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
0.0	0.473928545603	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.490624951505	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.530880578156	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.219235945594	I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible.
0.0	0.277926516725	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.429129644639	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.
0.0	0.619817486771	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.467591800897	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.302914305772	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.144399616121	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.572845562429	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.394756059064	But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.445495304714	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.
0.0	0.117175969036	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.345521287127	I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
0.0	0.166420463201	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.608736843175	$5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.485509466095	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.160318162131	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.14769637454	John, I would disagree with Secretary Clinton respectfully on this score.
0.0	0.486085466919	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.240007405488	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.355784071401	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.545020658083	And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.349165898655	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.405319443783	Find out what I said to Greenspan.
1.0	0.639735194418	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.148973028579	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.407388453095	So the fact is that we work for the people.
0.0	0.580820985243	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.163449040411	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.443608982638	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.
0.0	0.331741272688	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.492564230419	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.330263837426	I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart.
0.0	0.40102223808	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.5	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.291474187582	And look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that.
0.0	0.514454208889	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.545569053638	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.

0.0	0.0433711391379	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.535736229217	On two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago.
0.0	0.590983670801	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.

0.0	0.251787216128	Of course.

0.0	0.275817991912	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.43544489967	And here's the problem in this country right now.
0.0	0.263652654233	There are a lot of factors involved in that.
0.0	0.32821964323	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.491560950127	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.485051331597	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.

0.0	0.476043730454	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.5284907198	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.

0.0	0.147763980906	John, I think somewhere between...
0.0	0.010245715172	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.400720572643	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
1.0	0.859672376151	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.493930492915	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.560426772995	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.602768493546	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.195607028501	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.

0.0	0.0636789862204	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.308402676897	... (inaudible) opening statement.
0.0	0.461758003637	At the same time we're doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform.
0.0	0.102913598495	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.553447090548	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.567660606178	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.444543586164	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.30249675758	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.367609295727	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.0887672540284	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.505346891973	All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.

0.0	0.189481662584	They kill us.
0.0	0.465958283307	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.511213669525	So I believe that over the next few years, not tomorrow, but over the next few years, we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour.
1.0	0.557775159645	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.516935855836	The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.
0.0	0.444200205502	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.014454225091	...Chris...
0.0	0.541136584659	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.260969295017	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.373776656648	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.219886230052	... Well, no, no.
0.0	0.374202201299	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.0572268531094	We all understand that.
0.0	0.562477074743	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.318139485943	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
1.0	0.609344089619	$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work.
1.0	0.537963398506	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.186428731583	Those are all really positive developments.
0.0	0.348762525733	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.486169861023	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.313721313631	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.570860594276	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.375912230259	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.
0.0	0.632549381182	Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization called ISIS.
0.0	0.213824651234	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.211389077398	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.455955784861	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.00528671421851	Yeah.
1.0	0.5516944897	2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.
0.0	0.251538243487	I will not do that.
0.0	0.422255541242	So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.
1.0	0.911824088816	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.35008079399	I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s.
0.0	0.57076604117	I also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees.
0.0	0.133752286555	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.259366825118	Fact check me.
0.0	0.295836450449	A lot of the rights that have been won over years, from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights, will be at risk.
1.0	0.537515681805	In 1988, I lost an election because I said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of America.
0.0	0.261883608272	You just can't do it.
0.0	0.195815962177	I said, "how's it going?"
0.0	0.573564705463	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.322124354545	And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.
0.0	0.5	And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending.
0.0	0.318248388557	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.493789371267	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.280927616081	By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa.
0.0	0.0367838952859	slot.
0.0	0.301855987799	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.0550001861051	I win.
0.0	0.170130106652	Thank you, good night and may the force be with you.
0.0	0.486602129796	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.
0.0	0.375739495805	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.492147641929	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.293048835202	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.169756169058	I kind of miss Donald Trump.
0.0	0.0424704892701	And you know what?
1.0	0.481768878944	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.297195443919	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.478718598337	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.183759795888	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.449736822505	This will end.
0.0	0.259146558569	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.5	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
0.0	0.425686343516	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.29570883089	Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength.
1.0	0.921698370544	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.345077247368	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.472648763335	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.264586051904	And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?
0.0	0.43557285973	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.238700783258	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.357368883836	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.0297125818697	Yes.
0.0	0.5	Our staff found information on our computers from the Clinton campaign.
0.0	0.0943335319664	I don't have to brag.
0.0	0.522592677673	For over 200 years, America's light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again.
0.0	0.319335282636	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.318507009101	Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.
0.0	0.510910184515	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.
0.0	0.564298026668	When you ran in 2000, you said that we needed federal robust regulations.
0.0	0.238308494869	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.526942849453	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.307142607561	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.391000670072	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.31787663568	I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
0.0	0.366309397348	I'm running for president, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people.
0.0	0.904648168982	And...
0.0	0.415314588903	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.266891265119	Well, I'll tell you who is on my side.
0.0	0.254321947313	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.5	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.0360178793409	And that's what's happening.
0.0	0.596421113084	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.312060284425	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.327963995987	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
1.0	0.466732243991	Well, John, look, I think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis to leave by 2011, is that an Iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend Iraq.
0.0	0.40021195241	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.559401790304	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.0989465391071	Dynamically.
0.0	0.236135763651	He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments.
0.0	0.330241059833	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.228988667366	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.598437232163	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?

0.0	0.534702026728	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
0.0	0.404856182944	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.

0.0	0.19697162678	We have tremendous people.
0.0	0.573771310163	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.442820401892	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.
0.0	0.118433030971	So I don't think...

0.0	0.0183224443913	OK?
0.0	0.0603196819234	I have a wonderful family.
0.0	0.20643847544	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?
0.0	0.473493370204	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
1.0	0.429592587127	However, what Alan Krueger said in the piece you're referring to is that if we went to $15, there are no international comparisons.
0.0	0.231640045178	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.

0.0	0.347387916273	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?

0.0	0.36424900095	... and 85 percent of gun owners agree.
0.0	0.391716407833	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.350105062139	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.185922374247	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.391512233043	They will not bring us -- believe me -- to the promised land.
0.0	0.543313514758	I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war.
0.0	0.333951408106	That will change everything.
0.0	0.468808947952	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.579410530977	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.476686593004	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.12251749958	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.416445748295	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.526275609768	And so do I.
0.0	0.155435698671	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.191039238502	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.221413501186	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.253272898417	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.320076718661	We will be there soon.
0.0	0.0579554363055	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.451530476452	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.299820208497	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.0243855013102	Wow.
0.0	0.0774366639537	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.233354968356	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.
0.0	0.557452492066	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.212271344879	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.18463059501	Big difference.
0.0	0.556160780539	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.219257904901	I never said that.
0.0	0.126854840558	Right.
0.0	0.0537595462517	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.516161896118	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.345590459252	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.453751140634	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.
0.0	0.259042707339	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.170848259255	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.602454267691	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.426126994498	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.512704826191	And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
0.0	0.541725686648	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
0.0	0.34290104735	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.290605811818	Do the $12 and you would index it.
0.0	0.184021025084	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.181385398004	You are not our adversary, you are our partner.
0.0	0.399466079729	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.610512990141	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.107279506654	We've got to hate the Muslims."
0.0	0.557431207667	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.467311386069	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.193518222826	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.45612636964	They're not supporting our law enforcement officers, it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.259109752421	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.590991836284	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.240222530702	You have to lead.
0.0	0.0183224443913	OK.
0.0	0.430440338387	We reduced violent crime to 30-year lows.
0.0	0.529521641725	Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
0.0	0.238055398993	I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
0.0	0.284370113723	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
0.0	0.458616036058	I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
0.0	0.273805049403	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
0.0	0.492932548086	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.0748720264288	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.196675011745	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.208337634167	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.4748444829	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.341126157443	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.481821328841	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.5	But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible.
0.0	0.5422301781	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
0.0	0.531843476907	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.212398033392	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.454149191874	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.240058792211	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.105255925342	It's true.
0.0	0.221734302021	It's become more complicated.
0.0	0.105255925342	That's true.
0.0	0.473937721638	They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.
0.0	0.31241995064	There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better.
0.0	0.536892540921	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.145488430748	I think we all support that.
0.0	0.271195824398	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.328845659218	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.409195153406	But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.
0.0	0.393488808328	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.00528671421851	Yeah.
0.0	0.645918341993	Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs.
0.0	0.178937927524	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.0634124762181	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.493962396178	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
0.0	0.508261863161	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.409804592382	And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.
0.0	0.045293870076	Those are your enemies.
0.0	0.361319607106	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.399484836201	My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves.
0.0	0.45215368433	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.656231972328	Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.
0.0	0.477271029545	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.5	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
0.0	0.302200653539	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.450405198864	We now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act, and I don't think we should have to be defending it among Democrats.
0.0	0.0238222223224	I think what is...
0.0	0.904260977693	Why is that?
1.0	0.553246621548	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.592324891729	Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems.
0.0	0.295147281917	... of $50 billion...
1.0	0.943949727132	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.248792651289	Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.
0.0	0.53213208212	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.169132500833	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.552520055522	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.508077746688	And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion, this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us, and that we stand with them as they have stood with us.
0.0	0.0811441284949	Folks, you want to --

0.0	0.308963012685	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.470385666334	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.38235105008	There are a lot of things we've got to do in our country, reigning in Wall Street is certainly one of them.
0.0	0.165619700881	I was not the secretary of state...
0.0	0.281194406596	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.198969344513	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.392843169277	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.45320767255	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.477158906339	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
1.0	0.43310729285	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.37009211902	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.0588958275593	You don't have to.
0.0	0.215846839374	But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate.
0.0	0.343716185871	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.398560501718	I would like to start with a basic.
1.0	0.355329723983	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.684301012841	They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.
0.0	0.225986302149	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.559514584745	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.428610273188	But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance.
0.0	0.00570076009133	Thank you, Marco.
0.0	0.407475409874	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.

0.0	0.53389310492	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.

0.0	0.451040550534	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.483009283769	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.342507452238	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.241064409024	We don't have victories anymore.
0.0	0.385886753489	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.22711020415	And some, I assume, are good people.
0.0	0.130244690356	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.349413598129	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.574304712882	They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.

0.0	0.206583026377	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.522529502149	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
1.0	0.954234496203	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.

0.0	0.506503809687	Kathie, that is the kind of economy I believe, put money in the hands of working people, raise the minimum wage to 15 buck an hour.
0.0	0.31286354594	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.538710865313	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.692276995813	They built it in about one year, this massive military port.

0.0	0.381864151114	Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform.
0.0	0.384203657287	People have invested a lot of energy into that.
0.0	0.0179012862328	So was I, John.
0.0	0.47974053503	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.1082147517	But Obamacare kicks in in 2016.

0.0	0.217267577059	Sit down with people like John Mccain.
0.0	0.372706333506	The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.
0.0	0.245788112215	Bottom line.
0.0	0.417847275903	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.540648882305	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.588865320072	It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control.
0.0	0.144019549428	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.049741626195	You bet they do.
0.0	0.586687250612	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.
0.0	0.525737212605	But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
0.0	0.5	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.148873330954	Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.
0.0	0.0605890949723	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.

0.0	0.399468768086	I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil.
0.0	0.424979469146	And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.
0.0	0.185904449962	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.032642844078	Well, thank you, John.

0.0	0.0588958275593	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.088455944049	That is absolutely not right.

0.0	0.534720310994	In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.
0.0	0.129509326317	That is exactly...
0.0	0.5113310697	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.526028036596	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.532786294462	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.538048975923	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.
0.0	0.446448034526	In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston.

0.0	0.414390998725	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.328381597241	Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves.
0.0	0.153117962552	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.407851973473	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.141906189288	I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie.
0.0	0.276437050697	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.250433201127	All of these are very difficult issues.
0.0	0.360389678189	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.428684270346	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.381228037835	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.523352003672	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.344452206759	I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones.
0.0	0.466405047325	When was the last time you heard China is killing us?
0.0	0.61532885219	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.0161957177672	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.271985842841	The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.419929908829	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.0656003723667	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.287596954007	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.27939776415	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.444700018522	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.

0.0	0.369097188572	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.0978147399997	I'd consider it.

0.0	0.201497120232	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
1.0	0.184199158089	I was not at all critical of him.

0.0	0.331093362833	We've enacted it in our state.

0.0	0.511534670884	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
1.0	0.875344014496	They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.
0.0	0.598483549403	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.350969294131	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.560344299743	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.286834944459	I mean, let's talk about this arc of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about.
0.0	0.118199433021	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.182457851861	And I applaud his record in Maryland.
0.0	0.389073841042	And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.
0.0	0.25802752812	We got $18 trillion in debt.
1.0	0.592805522909	In fact, wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century, after my husband's administration.
0.0	0.207340371102	He couldn't answer the question.
0.0	0.225889620989	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.216113563069	I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary...
0.0	0.512077240082	Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage.
0.0	0.469939353687	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.393453212015	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.227707437011	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.5	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.319055346047	We need to define the enemy.
0.0	0.533999928215	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
0.0	0.566702729101	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.904454749899	You do.
0.0	0.328555090343	Because a lot of people said, "He'll never run.
0.0	0.472649667034	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.0482525394527	But they're not good.
0.0	0.0789547584754	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.407182943527	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.454523817843	I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.
0.0	0.292426655889	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.0105607038101	Yes, I apologize.
0.0	0.305894683592	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.320306093688	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.60110946966	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.217622405546	Ask Boeing.
0.0	0.042564184389	You know why?
0.0	0.348610616958	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.5	And that this world, with American leadership, can and must come together to destroy them.
0.0	0.228560249159	So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.
0.0	0.556986472983	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.0893029412984	That's calling it what it is.
0.0	0.261226263189	Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.
0.0	0.447468658664	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.471323738892	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.167976698784	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.377014679828	... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.361315778434	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.272273987603	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.53338553542	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.459095882975	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
1.0	0.710965291084	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.
0.0	0.343886506529	It was an investment bank.
0.0	0.41874074575	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.558395917017	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.0336648505507	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.351812679945	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.482224048605	Like we have a -- we have a lot of work to do and we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do.
0.0	0.459697809827	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
0.0	0.0708001657825	Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country.
0.0	0.110762236542	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.494296286506	And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.295639239572	If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune.
0.0	0.25658013865	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.564475417412	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.638688006006	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.294386442516	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.580892855428	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.243187696147	Nobody can do that like me.
0.0	0.321343817875	We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.
1.0	0.977929483849	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.243790563565	And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?
0.0	0.456125495716	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.429187069624	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.355062693334	So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.
0.0	0.455616408073	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.100101277766	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.273167164114	We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.
0.0	0.903872371984	No, I have not.
0.0	0.0460992113615	And I opposed it.
0.0	0.600861792472	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.369740383903	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.0929926689197	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.370982781388	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.37431397058	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.307095275981	We need sound money.
0.0	0.5	Of course the United States must lead.
1.0	0.868642856309	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.0839525685393	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.631960283761	Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.
0.0	0.161445561946	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.453121641557	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.612663388968	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.90484123543	...
0.0	0.256216828195	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.5	It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.
0.0	0.588678300458	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
0.0	0.017981393538	No, John.
0.0	0.377079028024	We have people that aren't smart.
0.0	0.234842008313	Let's get rid of Assad later.
0.0	0.02823105221	Great.
0.0	0.331251899197	I watched the video of Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.240592322839	I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.
0.0	0.638793725552	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.317056858024	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.464096388306	This country is changing.
0.0	0.567566662188	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.411941270807	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.259503298848	But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything -- everything, they got away with it again.
0.0	0.642471820453	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.359880376214	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.421382647399	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.
0.0	0.55056661713	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.252805102067	I will...
0.0	0.381033649412	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.281858855489	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
1.0	0.896861149207	This small country has welcomed in many refugees.
0.0	0.344207050211	My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.
0.0	0.279913278767	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.547129614154	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.396001426853	The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.
0.0	0.411280353371	We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it.
0.0	0.289678632489	Not only -- not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton -- and I hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- I want to apologize to my supporters.
0.0	0.418874746528	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.0163120751456	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.377050230701	Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?
0.0	0.467864184252	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.207416903686	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.26982596805	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.155514648069	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.415275042656	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.453662271428	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.0281058149264	He does great.
0.0	0.558672439574	Now that Russia has joined us in the Security Council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago, now I think we can have those conversations.
0.0	0.127370807382	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.410678950495	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.
0.0	0.374499236874	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.315454170168	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.0265299846207	He's very smooth.
0.0	0.166804395398	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.370350455818	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.343128951022	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.533417066877	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.199882811583	And I think has had a big impact.
0.0	0.122733855432	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.198952623287	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.319899278264	I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.455027615567	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.28280712307	They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there.
0.0	0.348540412977	If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.
0.0	0.552822054067	My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.
0.0	0.0811155979791	That's for sure.
0.0	0.195104507848	But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.40774101794	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.301153715339	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
0.0	0.130727370002	But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.
1.0	0.433397934645	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.181465951562	Now, here's what is going to happen.
0.0	0.315874267244	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.28129410847	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.359718297269	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.2217236745	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.162093786786	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.267153427442	And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't."
0.0	0.287813702662	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.288050190176	I've dealt with them all my life.
0.0	0.105485061315	I think the issue here is -- and I applaud Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.509866576101	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.488031543509	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.0838982391823	That's what really matters.
0.0	0.442355236372	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.21356488255	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.246968083651	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.0941774881157	I do not think it would come to that.
0.0	0.473416740027	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.345119177148	And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
0.0	0.41183302574	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.208795374762	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.107142052685	They can't.
0.0	0.524254981438	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.352073347537	Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
0.0	0.268352835419	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.43417044531	I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.
0.0	0.428148508298	But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go.
0.0	0.126359607749	She was right.
0.0	0.269876732617	It's great to be at Trump Tower.
0.0	0.319349009978	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.509397317259	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.384488509798	Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server.
0.0	0.455385532378	I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.
0.0	0.186489697865	She never lived to see that.
1.0	0.871817042555	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.474344109306	The young officer who was killed responding to the Planned Parenthood murders.
0.0	0.395424466183	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.35047053796	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.515161243241	But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it.
0.0	0.523438723964	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
0.0	0.146836295995	I introduced...
0.0	0.28374376046	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
1.0	0.196381606225	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.335370048918	Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint.
0.0	0.904066851883	What are we doing?
0.0	0.474992887826	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.381501125536	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.0461534484597	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.253732369091	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.166861794686	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.532600861897	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.346539627161	We bailed out Wall Street.
0.0	0.465833428457	But the United States is not the policeman of the world.
0.0	0.461465351728	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.0922795734987	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.177243006106	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.543248999765	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.396487094082	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.415252634747	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.469565000201	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.222959597346	I mean, that's a fact.
1.0	0.757699938933	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
1.0	0.130240784032	It was below zero.
0.0	0.328297685353	And I understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary.
0.0	0.449629555346	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.904648168982	No.
0.0	0.216466205439	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
0.0	0.600639334368	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.405734472	We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game.
0.0	0.339266333511	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.0624412253633	And before I say it, I have to say this.
0.0	0.305942466423	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.382349423141	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	2.04510140507e-05	...Thank you.
0.0	0.623502336633	But there is a broad consensus on sensible gun safety regulations that I, coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, will do my best to bring together.
0.0	0.459277967615	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.145093423979	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.0310522946322	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.591934186032	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.448065466145	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.11045162393	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.619637276613	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.188527439476	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.592946784713	It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act.
0.0	0.515101854715	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.3195383939	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.0690957986901	But get this.
0.0	0.61611780293	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.302044186735	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.342518694476	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.600836117784	The number of heroin deaths are growing very, very significantly.
0.0	0.396425682381	Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.
0.0	0.518736647064	And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
0.0	0.5	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.258081768216	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.436517778499	And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.
0.0	0.390232061267	I gotta build those big buildings.
0.0	0.271857076755	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.552636793415	They are anxious on a number of levels.
0.0	0.52677599955	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.
0.0	0.14288336561	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.284230796256	Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...
0.0	0.180137304522	And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.
0.0	0.336186067528	We expand Medicare to all people.
0.0	0.250980169299	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.517539834706	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.0825897382634	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.904648168982	So...
0.0	0.485723981134	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.570239666232	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.521965758487	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.335892658063	Can I -- can I -- I just...
0.0	0.126446503297	And, we said no.
0.0	0.337992065859	But this is what we also have to say.
0.0	0.350319444405	Close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole and...
0.0	0.520693589653	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.458196548987	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.143198209088	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.191645511612	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.435258324634	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.137612811938	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.402269761758	I do agree that in particular, Turkey and the Gulf nations have got to make up their minds.
0.0	0.131025225404	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.0771461304799	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.58125781289	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.5	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.
0.0	0.904648168982	These...
0.0	0.561559725776	Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons -- three out of four people in prison are black or brown.
0.0	0.616943442398	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.401986205287	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.246723797483	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.285374402186	Yes, we must protect our borders.
0.0	0.203241325957	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.368656466488	We got a U.N. Security council vote.
0.0	0.244203911281	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.141708386049	Let's keep going.
0.0	0.525339069285	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.19102530568	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.467709590255	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.41128710397	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
0.0	0.206699529406	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.116555236832	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.520354054502	We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally.
0.0	0.117733123616	I don't think it's gonna happen.
0.0	0.358012586624	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.229973256393	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.446763915642	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.34222405169	There must be some way.
0.0	0.297922563336	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.310039650618	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.105641115128	It's their money.
0.0	0.0256074569859	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.5	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.0182675756924	Absolutely.
1.0	0.527674422893	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.113246399177	And we're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.318829021172	I know every one.
0.0	0.109084243402	What are you going to do for my kids?
0.0	0.505019640984	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.292451459978	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.306081370427	So, yes, this has developed.
0.0	0.109013733888	I like it.
0.0	0.313833087902	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.589240664214	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.144496885693	There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.
0.0	0.343347501044	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.525371979023	But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
0.0	0.413876495125	Sit down with people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the house, and work on a bill.
0.0	0.118433030971	I don't think so.
0.0	0.172581268167	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.3091207962	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.681530935593	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.419333852718	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.126208550834	Does anyone know this?"
0.0	0.304862462507	Revolution never came.
0.0	0.302127969609	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.456706786128	Last point.
0.0	0.481097093798	As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country.
0.0	0.4839698729	You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.
0.0	0.391567605546	I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.
0.0	0.295836067776	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...
0.0	0.34078438577	And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that.
0.0	0.617938866095	I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground.
0.0	0.407732953717	And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.
0.0	0.429169531751	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.0102266104981	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.401041395297	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.408662705627	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
0.0	0.287917549106	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.344492378974	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.261483237145	And they wanted to make sure it got built.
0.0	0.431473605751	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.0236635558737	Kathie, I think -- Kathie the...
0.0	0.32909799124	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.417293315885	We were the first in the family.
0.0	0.477150827076	I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.488902439321	Against the Republican leadership, who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies.
0.0	0.384199140783	But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.
0.0	0.0807216738418	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.170809021943	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.415450222121	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.520458544834	If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences.
0.0	0.462990868295	You read about all the companies now that are doing business -- about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on.
0.0	0.146348813317	Those hedge funds.
0.0	0.293797018613	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.0300033862892	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.224795969299	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.518230639401	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.232734162346	Given the fact that she's a lot smarter than me, yes, she would.
0.0	0.372339760767	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.126607017114	All right.
0.0	0.475561233502	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.0599886429354	We're friends.
0.0	0.098053698743	You want me to answer that question?
1.0	0.832329109072	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.185005110085	It really is important that we go forward on this.
0.0	0.361487513956	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.579642451576	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.433032159076	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.535329287282	And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals -- the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
0.0	0.475426671967	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.175688151647	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.312562879309	She led that effort.
0.0	0.299881824839	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.220977116913	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.275771822687	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.433950268287	Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.
0.0	0.105045220991	It's not true.
0.0	0.0882046067083	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.467883964122	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.389692335771	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.0800519877457	And it's-- it's a worthy debate.
0.0	0.451424678657	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
0.0	0.300814471841	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.538395425394	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.291634973192	We actually did it.
0.0	0.634031914437	We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.
0.0	0.546338195622	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.481826222773	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
1.0	0.319073242443	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.305207185932	That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.354406725919	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.18725655348	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.0297125818697	Yes.
0.0	0.90484123543	...
0.0	0.5	Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors.
0.0	0.0499715213995	I (inaudible).
0.0	0.0883775534369	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.278902200188	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.0668179233661	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.566674562307	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.

0.0	0.424921566637	I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries.

0.0	0.0744425018782	Not bad.
0.0	0.483516445932	But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that.
0.0	0.22422593055	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.

0.0	0.904648168982	No.
0.0	0.650337668547	Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.
0.0	0.460699814281	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.599225508986	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
0.0	0.374460977389	And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent.
0.0	0.340482215649	Because you realize that people depending on you.

0.0	0.568258362219	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.372145109693	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.370663713534	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.480530094785	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.512816851097	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?

0.0	0.174456249781	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
1.0	0.24840485841	The Republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times.
0.0	0.347067065166	I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work.
0.0	0.249229959714	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.271329120939	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.538125837037	I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.640211226463	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.419749960855	First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino.

0.0	0.904260977693	No, no.
0.0	0.571274933837	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.512393319947	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.5	I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war.
0.0	0.153962182698	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.30408695749	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.163763528008	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.412589346053	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.214380084179	I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it.
0.0	0.419460902388	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.188285263718	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.0814500406133	Sure did.
0.0	0.228172708781	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.220402475685	Are you not running?
0.0	0.301366698627	We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
0.0	0.0636155505155	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?
0.0	0.342600068914	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.429157219117	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
0.0	0.532912590946	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.314765925279	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.448471387339	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.21506317442	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.377645344773	And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.470867083749	I've employed -- I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
0.0	0.528566813644	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.
0.0	0.348927829383	Well, I would just repeat that.
0.0	0.448788538966	I sell apartments for -- I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.
0.0	0.526745009186	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
0.0	0.0816177327721	Sure.
0.0	0.126942027181	I said no.
0.0	0.282547560936	There won't be any -- you can get it.
1.0	0.657539662695	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.0977291922115	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.342728517746	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.457582912975	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.313169477915	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.548218653464	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.469590541813	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.161529960854	It goes away.
0.0	0.293069255295	The troops on the ground should not be American troops.
0.0	0.236743967168	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.521250706034	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.463379373234	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.552178357533	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.527805298564	And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.
0.0	0.505779237534	And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation.
0.0	0.1463127458	I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.
0.0	0.218265383128	Then I looked at Rubio.
0.0	0.396071511451	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.581285127493	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.382327708033	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.477692398843	RADDATZ: OK. Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, right here at Saint Anselm college, Neil Levesque.
0.0	0.227297379654	The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court?
0.0	0.35507964786	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.450074428661	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.126854840558	Right.
0.0	0.90484123543	...
0.0	0.295136994795	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.342034750118	It all will be scrutinized.
0.0	0.109013733888	I like them.
0.0	0.607703256425	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.13119575642	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.428578120166	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.353221964302	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.397613765265	As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.
1.0	0.891288771085	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.465932810566	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...
0.0	0.445372438174	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
0.0	0.367673560063	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.427114439186	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.15014881021	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.0122970755202	Excuse me, no.
0.0	0.46821845829	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.0556748257225	I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail.
0.0	0.421973232698	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.318239697565	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
1.0	0.881364436718	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.276770565144	Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem.
0.0	0.471883447712	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.430073923708	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.492829920935	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.
0.0	0.192145519852	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.345184508089	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.424978760019	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.
0.0	0.538540787308	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.
0.0	0.406602156563	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.387322771842	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.58485576215	Many are in this building.
0.0	0.33898280979	And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage.
0.0	0.349624843804	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.423885821356	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.34648384036	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
1.0	0.927115194263	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.177681844463	Go ahead.
0.0	0.516419004082	You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.
0.0	0.904454749899	You did.
0.0	0.336015327487	We need -- we need somebody -- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.
0.0	0.260367602738	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.406115203621	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.415592637052	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.42966531651	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.257977854778	I said, "What's your problem?"
0.0	0.330707835806	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.642412816483	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.109013733888	I like that.
0.0	0.627303178526	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.201326415035	Get rid of the fraud.
0.0	0.0101999776732	Thank you very, very much.

0.0	0.505458223315	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.

0.0	0.904648168982	No.
1.0	0.945430021466	And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.
0.0	0.128984592382	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
0.0	0.109469654721	They should be Muslim troops.
0.0	0.428131209383	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.

0.0	0.440129449297	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.242831055826	If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen.
0.0	0.391086382631	I'll advertise my Web site as well.

0.0	0.5	I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
0.0	0.436976444919	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.250205068444	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.

0.0	0.0957586788366	That is the issue.
0.0	0.532010932311	Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.
1.0	0.849376117604	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.365354406739	We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love -- they're great -- all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.

0.0	0.201631730523	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.29996108154	Martha -- I would just repeat that --

0.0	0.211273636881	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.5889741734	I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal.
0.0	0.453134477441	And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.
0.0	0.242525216758	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
0.0	0.49386706591	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.38128961654	The nature of warfare has changed.
0.0	0.42714891035	Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military.
0.0	0.323245939825	So I said (ph), "No, that's the wrong number.

0.0	0.256840227282	We don't eliminate Medicare.
0.0	0.0720392829682	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.243515872156	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.171727095364	I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country.
0.0	0.260691201357	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.115461711595	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.529789795166	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.

0.0	0.478137752039	They are our first line of defense.
0.0	0.398255693399	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.111510238281	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.319577763693	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.550547840129	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.0122103369484	Whoa.
0.0	0.315587755965	I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.
0.0	0.368060716895	So ladies and gentlemen...I am officially running...... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.
0.0	0.308581865778	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.3853281362	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.311003225837	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.300225113191	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.5	It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.443644219569	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.225307423153	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.357885596199	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.243791531268	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.368194955344	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.2418667207	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.282818169319	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.4857311493	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.347405483816	And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.
0.0	0.38716628895	By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job.
0.0	0.0605387684414	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.427526445381	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.278854797005	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.529017992595	We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents.
0.0	0.553600973055	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.554239152196	When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish Glass-Stegall.
0.0	0.00969789532474	It's nice.
0.0	0.48271420584	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.594531736908	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.509949903252	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.217642358679	The formula is working.
0.0	0.267035062194	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.455355146659	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.254037001757	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.314172119597	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.30457011113	What is the best way to do it?
0.0	0.377246531572	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.272589407705	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.408022632024	But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.
0.0	0.488382302399	The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
0.0	0.387030900038	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.564653403237	this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.
0.0	0.221254158745	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.577729853787	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.527623811289	And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work.
0.0	0.172573550482	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.0874245752015	We're up 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.528315748821	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.0596076986011	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.0366472321625	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.374590313727	And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go.
0.0	0.368525509445	So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again.
0.0	0.551970091992	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.258081768216	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.49099620196	We are already de-conflicting air space.
0.0	0.372385839647	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.212333536029	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.548680440751	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.181928422811	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.459119627494	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.208843773975	We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
0.0	0.601938169177	This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.
0.0	0.111112483039	They thought something was wrong.
0.0	0.128605286797	I don't want it.
0.0	0.354648275377	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
0.0	0.108993788946	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.0418191624257	We get a traitor.
0.0	0.416951055134	First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, "they cannot have it all."
0.0	0.476277209856	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.117809865524	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.290367258786	In all due respect...
0.0	0.46526893325	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
1.0	0.527472585538	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.536649452715	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.107919190851	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.415703907101	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.5	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.242211488347	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.5	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.513157594374	We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.457768982389	They will be our early warning signal.
0.0	0.192216947944	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
0.0	0.438738697932	We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.
0.0	0.128345836769	I like China.
0.0	0.320366643879	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.
0.0	0.510189769136	I believe that our Federal Government needs to do more on pell grants.
0.0	0.36456448988	But he used to say, "Donald, don't go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.334204274179	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.327845244364	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.541873643147	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.0032145329362	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.241937361597	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.

0.0	0.559350867825	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.408159280829	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.0640017690343	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.235460498528	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
1.0	0.837599272626	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.424507443428	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.256648700026	And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people.
0.0	0.205395527507	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.0484207172566	Please go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.335566712995	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.369108116978	That's the secondary issue.
0.0	0.0477244621627	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.0648067540849	I promise.
0.0	0.467772759617	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.50899386864	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.214220720427	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.128400795743	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.111819549515	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.492266580484	John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL, and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening.
1.0	0.935694222442	Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?
0.0	0.331797989431	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.182836759013	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.463466482513	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
0.0	0.22272525917	What have you got now?
0.0	0.148816764016	They've advertised that.
0.0	0.5	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.
0.0	0.294505780919	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.29534707494	You don't serve us.
0.0	0.33367373913	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.412763528704	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.594346283971	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.126607017114	All right.
0.0	0.0323422355068	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.402472106272	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.37640838733	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.427154877465	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.409338339877	I will work my heart out.
0.0	0.39878653119	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.389750080526	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.
0.0	0.383854516464	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.182169460384	I would invite him, I actually would say.
0.0	0.549391117524	I've had had two town halls, one in Keene, one in Laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do.
0.0	0.46844191571	It's very important we operate on both at the same time.
0.0	0.0130789365228	Oh.
0.0	0.337692256417	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.363285955983	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.506039632353	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.609618135942	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
0.0	0.37347168282	But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."
0.0	0.52312525005	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.0375701319293	I really am.
0.0	0.126857118811	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.212822404884	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
0.0	0.0492518251076	It was terrible.
0.0	0.436525902564	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.449413641916	I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.
0.0	0.113471468079	We're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.213519793867	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.310880807866	I want security.
0.0	0.0874875933255	And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.426758311927	We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States.
0.0	0.393870517007	First of all...
0.0	0.550020061875	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.149490031361	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.412001561981	Well, there are so many, I don't know where to start.
0.0	0.358182148514	People were just being fined to death.
0.0	0.352159010863	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.126359607749	That's right.
0.0	0.46177260444	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.279451174219	I beat China all the time.
0.0	0.375809350099	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.418184967792	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.904260977693	Why is it...
0.0	0.344433583739	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
1.0	0.594233527999	And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent.
1.0	0.5	And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions.
0.0	0.306434233178	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.193008177532	If not, they can stay where they are.
0.0	0.253406164889	Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.
0.0	0.173204374914	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.307095275981	We need sound money.
0.0	0.539296280027	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.521367485254	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.595913046816	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.304626987638	If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say?
0.0	0.367112425891	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.222040166522	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.468286916239	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.576234196928	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.46578827988	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.308353268064	Might I respond?
0.0	0.0102228208945	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.167674827158	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.366438953592	I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that's what Iowans like to do.
0.0	0.648744733851	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.483501384249	But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired.
0.0	0.291634973192	But actually I am.
0.0	0.521730973719	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.361848496157	It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino.
0.0	0.552846393339	I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country.
0.0	0.11829311027	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.0453811813582	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.00379398555491	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.128611717873	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.358681324169	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.162644273094	They're killing us.
0.0	0.271780760041	They would never be hired again.
1.0	0.455812744221	That's wrong.
0.0	0.457112283818	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.300583355579	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.409224150257	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.23289642673	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.240306768379	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.272230748221	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
1.0	0.391592087554	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.619914750171	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.360143091007	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
0.0	0.380757236721	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.346058794497	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.536415842049	Here's my promise-- Wall Street representatives will not be in my cabinet.
0.0	0.401185913466	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.405069553311	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.317819430364	That never works.
0.0	0.173972350021	it won't happen.
0.0	0.323020834766	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
0.0	0.288540249216	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.472154900897	They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
0.0	0.360010928942	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.533215570621	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.240161861643	Go on to my website.
0.0	0.380159904593	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.333382614947	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.114252410781	I want a job."
0.0	0.515430103042	And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence.
0.0	0.180337650808	And, look, there are profound differences...
0.0	0.0937620991703	And they're wonderful people.
0.0	0.177769328955	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.290063199717	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.300178030495	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.180257689535	Don't believe it.
0.0	0.0958286065247	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
0.0	0.0940279246812	I am the son and grandson of immigrants.
0.0	0.240152123376	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.34086121177	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.331127089776	You cannot grant amnesty.
0.0	0.380125699988	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.522887914171	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.484739592472	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.409853777216	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.229540825995	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.592267916297	It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.
0.0	0.52709099789	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.126854840558	Right.
0.0	0.278606395115	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.221956649683	Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, "Sorry, fellas.
0.0	0.580983629015	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.192892675394	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.531268203418	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.360010377039	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.130752870712	No problem.
0.0	0.622862585401	John, the world is a very dangerous place, but the world is not too dangerous of a place for the United States of America, provided we act according to our principles, provided we act intelligently.
0.0	0.486866162322	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.319580175499	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.526834207755	I...
0.0	0.486679478097	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.441121112049	But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.
0.0	0.2951702679	Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.
0.0	0.422499530837	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.416311091408	We have people that have no incentive to work.
0.0	0.18877392274	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.436869346419	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.398023976444	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.353734794522	It -- it doesn't need to be that way.
0.0	0.435338797671	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.437103483498	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.5573950848	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.134806646947	They are ripping us.
0.0	0.581541630251	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.346149523382	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.283644373206	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.355248262739	I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons.
1.0	0.549993983741	But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works.
0.0	0.506158118982	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.146132588079	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
1.0	0.586966679764	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.231911384824	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.473302793705	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.44999469888	Good company.... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in -- and I wouldn't even use -- you know, I have -- I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
0.0	0.361718582587	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.904648168982	Why?
0.0	0.231338069228	They wouldn't be there except for us.
0.0	0.418657677014	We were the first to pass a minimum wage.
0.0	0.0426580799031	I know.
0.0	0.352186163244	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.201568025822	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.349535843759	I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security.
0.0	0.0527732024757	We got it.
0.0	0.460800516572	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.546737394836	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.19811103163	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.200270115778	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.151888993639	We don't know anything about that.
0.0	0.709651617677	Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.
0.0	0.449727838579	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.
0.0	0.372101347307	The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign.
0.0	0.221895402722	You want to know what carpet bombing is?
0.0	0.200886767938	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.599889896807	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.255006675288	So you might not.
0.0	0.010263307493	We are not France.
0.0	0.414410794111	But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it.
0.0	0.311924239486	May I respond to the critique on the ...
0.0	0.537145285856	I led the effort, unfortunately unsuccessfully, against deregulation because I knew when you merge large insurance companies and investment banks and commercial banks it was not going to be good.
1.0	0.557972542712	He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage, and what its effects are.
0.0	0.161143477088	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.299598940884	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.153962182698	I'm a free trader.

0.0	0.383360033979	And it's impossible for our people here to compete.

0.0	0.321063397826	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.625940281847	What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS.

0.0	0.347390779205	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
0.0	0.441054356956	And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
0.0	0.520091307063	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.

0.0	0.294363968332	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.
0.0	0.441261663035	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.122143940358	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.302576456393	Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.
0.0	0.465940611805	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.415580371723	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.

0.0	0.373546031271	If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
0.0	0.0149460035385	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.282590787054	Yes, and it was the same one that President Obama made.
0.0	0.224705915664	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.424327299661	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.

0.0	0.0574765736087	I understand.
0.0	0.415257932931	That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
0.0	0.396222283074	Well, I just want to quickly add...
0.0	0.277568829334	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.220655429791	Well, I did.
0.0	0.0736614055014	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.365789240597	Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values.
0.0	0.518813364442	End -- end Common Core.
0.0	0.309658863115	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.0983234933978	So it is difficult.
0.0	0.334524476406	You want to see a war on women?
1.0	0.919791891302	Today, we have 272.
0.0	0.434625084918	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.487662102652	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.655749356329	We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations.
0.0	0.388729982843	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.529058029114	I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone.
0.0	0.145878161571	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.560954448122	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.368127289436	Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.
0.0	0.266045158577	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.320676002493	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.451025283262	But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks."
0.0	0.080970161827	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.548210565329	The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.5	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.546311086523	One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines.
0.0	0.375220154885	I'm meeting with three of them in the next week.
0.0	0.0189689100614	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.10369192254	Very valuable.
0.0	0.189722833049	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.10418389352	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.439716165728	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.340535173746	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.308807608904	Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.
0.0	0.274913475385	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.512916439627	But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
0.0	0.307778668018	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.346185492575	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.410438198495	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.0509512914515	That's good.
0.0	0.436206757805	I want security for this country.
1.0	0.562658709601	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.298526015085	Their business model is greed and fraud.
0.0	0.590254330337	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
0.0	0.259109752421	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.376711745612	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
0.0	0.199706695751	We offered a lot more.
0.0	0.615068211104	The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.
1.0	0.955141737113	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.153905040723	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.288230888618	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.394509755491	But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
0.0	0.076477860263	Go on to martinomalley.com.
0.0	0.0139022652916	Alright.
0.0	0.485321404436	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.318739922177	So we need people -- I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.404517075785	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.
0.0	0.196804193394	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.456208499391	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.450310010751	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.378058109201	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.640667254025	I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.
0.0	0.47596811135	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.459114897875	Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.
0.0	0.0252036887605	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.0569881948841	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.371859049942	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.5	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.133991642076	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.444338586855	You know where their United States headquarters is located?
0.0	0.348901721635	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.347574222171	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.0879836777471	If I am elected president...
0.0	0.320878778716	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.438070243082	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.0318589109665	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.388084856183	Well, I think it's perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid.
0.0	0.0921023846656	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.273675057913	There are many lawyers.
1.0	0.361779624447	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.25259054065	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.469249198506	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.571591085809	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.904648168982	No.
0.0	0.304151632431	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.392434663521	And Abdullah said something recently, very important.
0.0	0.60098909609	But accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000.
0.0	0.215826102731	But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
0.0	0.355301255461	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.302012740566	These are very, very real issues.
0.0	0.314453196341	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.521278428001	I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.
0.0	0.560643778841	We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations.
0.0	0.137903065475	You get together.
0.0	0.43328194728	Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country.
0.0	0.629091791038	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.311240137911	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.351894636717	Our country is in crisis.
0.0	0.391654296343	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.358278026567	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.544990044448	So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.
0.0	0.246738138038	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.467554272154	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.
0.0	0.076002867593	For her convenience.
0.0	0.376277667239	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.0647166801829	He's a bad negotiator.
0.0	0.444583074744	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
1.0	0.506449774731	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.130885611726	We're running.
0.0	0.414267306641	They can't even answer simple questions.

0.0	0.181076579987	I don't think we're at war with Islam.
0.0	0.443009685511	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.193606102239	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.
0.0	0.90484123543	...
0.0	0.297745274684	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.514036073091	Now, this takes, David, 18 months to 24 months, two years.
0.0	0.404712451347	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.136973107375	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.320238939435	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.525526067245	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.422933726306	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
0.0	0.63642650998	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.506556268857	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.18892315579	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.492683830764	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.0936319134127	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.273977086521	I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.
0.0	0.281456694841	People were shocked, Trump got it.
0.0	0.181646754949	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.162862350645	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.43645187071	Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
0.0	0.397470566804	Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.
0.0	0.319901679119	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.515882294014	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.425260875888	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.522911179637	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.315828585836	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.368422314783	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.398865372432	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.334559393501	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.48131986138	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.413958174508	The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
0.0	0.21706817393	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.0721597576149	Good at email.
0.0	0.0605146187039	They're off to China.
0.0	0.469482094844	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.208362416177	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.543127113212	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.271064476329	And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China.
0.0	0.389118421864	That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities.
0.0	0.510201440801	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.233616638087	I like how you stand up.
0.0	0.485857600067	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.407785459082	And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.
0.0	0.121187472112	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.414705345244	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
1.0	0.86684283137	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.10518805319	You count on it.
0.0	0.0183224443913	OK?
0.0	0.0454493385121	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.101364885751	I hope you'll reconsider.
1.0	0.700507648472	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.413040624584	And now they are beating us economically.
0.0	0.636594580557	ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries.
0.0	0.0983660981191	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.391549847205	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.0615416210304	I am advocating...
0.0	0.0423769941588	We know about the Belgians.
0.0	0.281918008951	I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.
0.0	0.310952723353	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.271873723553	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.277132823988	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.368523159639	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.515991324663	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.532678124847	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.0505069574145	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.549325723486	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.201633383292	What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.
0.0	0.0622257096024	I love China.
0.0	0.403045497404	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.243439071057	They're terrified by the saber rattling.
0.0	0.0121016093294	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
0.0	0.508668085617	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.525837507389	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.0837773397394	I am telling the truth.
0.0	0.560152648532	But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.13063728139	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.541873771364	Major crisis and primary health care.
0.0	0.373122352044	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.389261878234	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.483163610708	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.109212552382	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.240853735772	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.242539584519	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.455280751801	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.303303420026	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.451194112666	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.433388482923	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.470489892706	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.306792673766	They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn.
0.0	0.533208853364	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.
0.0	0.484462748971	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
0.0	0.282749412872	Our next president...
0.0	0.390688865114	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.355189326217	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.54389939017	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.0266206578938	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.458546451956	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.0280434018678	How great is that?
0.0	0.309485778389	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.0887390460191	I think so, right.
0.0	0.0240977485528	Bill.
0.0	0.187848587265	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.421806271229	There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
0.0	0.360494812874	They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.
0.0	0.35874934371	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.523739480753	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.366757603764	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.
0.0	0.5	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.203129340255	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.563087774356	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.
0.0	0.164349912058	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.406717033596	If you want to make it into the middle class -- I'm not saying in all cases -- we need plumbers, and we need carpenters, and electricians, that's for sure, and they should get help as well.
0.0	0.141567736226	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.366882622954	... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street.
0.0	0.391459367272	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.309685975389	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.232415778923	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.566328339444	What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.425714326746	It will give hope to millions of young people.
0.0	0.331033537823	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.389402644057	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.304015055298	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
0.0	0.37485324877	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.0837382195531	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.148993521536	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.299696252873	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.126359607749	That's right.
0.0	0.360927779498	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.0372743588653	Wait for what?
0.0	0.436399835857	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.141631687645	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.366150737057	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.519223759361	That is some group of people.
0.0	0.5	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.52734281775	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
1.0	0.886694363873	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.5	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.5	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.248338623334	Everybody thought the deal was dead.
0.0	0.406407879026	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.202619574942	Really big league.
0.0	0.329475314469	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.658346271422	Number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own.
0.0	0.588097405342	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
1.0	0.856174474641	In 1988, just to set the record straight governor, I ran for the U.S. House.
0.0	0.384467664904	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.
0.0	0.358154283934	They have no plan now."
0.0	0.0218263082709	Maria...
0.0	0.406940370356	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.354684430583	And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen.
0.0	0.453152964262	They're building up their military to a point that is very scary.
0.0	0.20941810399	I'm not using the lobbyists.
0.0	0.277250306928	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.577186291335	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.260486959324	Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.
0.0	0.483470194951	Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.
0.0	0.295094322514	So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.
0.0	0.105193524671	And I'm confident we can do that.
0.0	0.257194662901	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.528413291156	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.0327546304166	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.294147566453	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.239081899682	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.444071595746	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.217087968894	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.275972152656	We're ready to start shooting."
0.0	0.436206757805	I want security for this country.
1.0	0.911851303767	The average middle-class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.561309549113	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.456756350106	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.225014250586	It's making...
0.0	0.410676594722	So, what we want to do is to say, look, we have 11 million people who have been here, many of them for decades.
0.0	0.241629297543	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.407493112359	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.
0.0	0.400260374564	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.623951721805	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.
0.0	0.592551634601	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.387371137294	So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.
0.0	0.312075743591	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.448208242678	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.364773309726	We actually passed a living wage.
0.0	0.134717637122	He didn't know.

0.0	0.550179931447	On January 20th, 2017, the next president of the United States will walk into the White House.
0.0	0.0663536607019	But not for us.
0.0	0.0713592900924	It sounds crass.
0.0	0.57118928931	Number one, there are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.559725487414	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
1.0	0.356623240766	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
1.0	0.608179205077	A $5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.411555122259	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.14838225855	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.292338166049	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.158475595972	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.382976469577	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?

0.0	0.563623025579	You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.

1.0	0.866388458763	And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money.
0.0	0.217608565873	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.258841081536	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
0.0	0.470681582811	I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.106714371459	I can't do it.
0.0	0.484705618552	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.586537282135	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.

0.0	0.39726423678	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.356154040224	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.379553743961	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.

0.0	0.576855532837	This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.
0.0	0.466214082392	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.0713486354488	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.0519376478197	So I have voiced criticisms.

0.0	0.209002171755	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.440789334505	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.255821188606	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.338488940018	That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them.
0.0	0.542788242888	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.527923092661	We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.
0.0	0.227550729058	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.461644075744	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.535688181351	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.218798184363	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.590471455988	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.
0.0	0.312844696491	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.
0.0	0.204057883453	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.244915135507	He can't have it both ways.
0.0	0.0300165288496	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.4422027928	This group needs to be confronted and defeated.
0.0	0.423316633499	So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income.
0.0	0.259602796316	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.521212089265	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.397173015129	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.489937328976	That's what I said to my own public health people.
0.0	0.178280885587	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.36991964861	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.165054728301	When did we beat Japan at anything?
0.0	0.126758685611	I've laid out...
0.0	0.904648168982	But...
0.0	0.213874632391	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
0.0	0.241499337806	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.218960968141	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.489493441207	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.378453966771	You learn that threats always change.
0.0	0.229344376484	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.379719183562	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.603054082432	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.391523160029	They went to the DNC quietly.
0.0	0.38789799914	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.0962790721446	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.30498383976	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.0854837538351	I feel like...
0.0	0.353987924755	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.232108997593	That is why we need to make...
0.0	0.510788745704	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.156806516504	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.173422127491	We should be supportive of that effort.
0.0	0.537481140732	So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion.
0.0	0.486822255566	And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.
0.0	0.405836056431	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.339071916013	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.234479863007	I mean, my dad went to college on a G.I.
0.0	0.169164075876	I want immigration reform to pass.
0.0	0.49209744105	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.418627562252	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.460496878762	I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.
0.0	0.300178030495	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.42512442447	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.584520007827	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.372356500286	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.21206801956	So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do.
0.0	0.558771480793	We increased education funding by 37 percent.
0.0	0.148931058361	I'm going to support you, and I think that is absolutely appropriate.
0.0	0.329582154995	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.312142335147	We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.
0.0	0.318001338611	That means education.
0.0	0.516781391024	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.337864521407	And I ended a federal entitlement.

0.0	0.321893263366	David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave.
0.0	0.193152087492	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.11634238142	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.
0.0	0.401885392129	But I said, "Don't hit Iraq," because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East.
1.0	0.82188618239	He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.
0.0	0.507027681559	How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years.
0.0	0.191426163388	The big banks--
0.0	0.5	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.115237877968	I would change them.
0.0	0.588070457521	And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.
0.0	0.405785836713	They would like to rip it up and start all over again, throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now.
0.0	0.310242422298	So protect the Second Amendment.
1.0	0.838004426776	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
0.0	0.399226020867	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.0498256388892	No vision at all.
0.0	0.34075805151	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
0.0	0.904260977693	How about this?
0.0	0.435220128903	Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.
0.0	0.395714137891	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
1.0	0.33464064801	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
1.0	0.819856167838	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.28386961771	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.00528671421851	Yeah.
0.0	0.305463960459	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.366532323421	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.341920365699	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.378219890511	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.209145559827	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.616261425174	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.
1.0	0.906233399291	So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education.
0.0	0.47883355845	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.437522057218	But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be looking for new sources of energy.
0.0	0.174171325172	In addition to that...
0.0	0.321421444293	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.480624461285	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.451431308749	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.26491463039	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.344308290853	And we need the right people.
0.0	0.376467522177	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.592878108497	You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56 percent, equivalent to 56 percent of the GDP In America.
0.0	0.253339349261	And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.
1.0	0.948544909104	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.574708655354	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
1.0	0.618095343395	I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.
0.0	0.436931478308	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.366016026908	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.389556237998	It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.
0.0	0.5	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.431896500783	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.213847392568	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.379624793863	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.0180618571737	John?
0.0	0.184676683183	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.187811534835	And for good cause.
0.0	0.232781300996	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.490981667916	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.100536840862	I'm tested.
0.0	0.394998600487	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.12429793526	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.405633033971	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.37140360199	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.260851050093	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.0735224413454	That's what should be done.
0.0	0.348730831824	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.0613151725556	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.519459638068	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.520189648224	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.
0.0	0.51318644997	Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.317626784106	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.259231255868	We need to stop that.
1.0	0.876655081491	Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.465241689698	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.366288256782	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
1.0	0.77537410006	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.5	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.611408920729	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.231419698389	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.280360477192	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.202066153003	We have -- I don't know that there's any disagreement here...
0.0	0.437350787665	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.5	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.567934266742	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.037128243345	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.487959648798	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.345394585366	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.595438660396	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.510077644593	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.
0.0	0.512855403166	I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.
0.0	0.292316030875	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.568438719583	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.273594604757	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.657043927479	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.431683313797	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.187321577901	He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, "No interest."
0.0	0.904454749899	It was.
0.0	0.174054953301	They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it."
0.0	0.553288950332	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.300190535475	Martha, we offered a lot more than they were willing to take.
0.0	0.420580284936	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.310571200703	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.377538084488	They're controlled fully -- they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
0.0	0.34953059893	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.614513368238	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.491929921807	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.371250426886	First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty.
0.0	0.447300640727	But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future.
0.0	0.463962518716	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.264272408813	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.0423100897737	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.181268741274	It didn't have the votes to pass.
0.0	0.276251736055	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.554675907712	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.586060218744	I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor, I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very, very powerful and most important of all jobs in the United States, the president, whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country.
0.0	0.360288409698	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.512333742641	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.904260977693	This is 2016.
0.0	0.2859982432	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.519957627082	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.245842385864	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.267795981182	You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well.
0.0	0.904066851883	Have to do it.
0.0	0.352161841599	And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.
0.0	0.419621810465	In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance.
0.0	0.391090009133	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.155740404886	There are thing that can be done.
0.0	0.48341059324	Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.
0.0	0.403215029301	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.0581854426209	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.153466093569	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.
0.0	0.424832449107	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.533890853737	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.494293415446	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.365346591275	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.331449112108	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.5	Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.355293014638	We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.441002984114	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.473636484205	But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.
0.0	0.306031421458	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.254771607699	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.177829233931	We have to find out what's going on.

0.0	0.538689504543	Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.
0.0	0.535439456776	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.370984042782	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.134062488157	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
1.0	0.919626608102	Today, we have about 4,000.
0.0	0.591376581502	And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.
0.0	0.49155822355	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.565497011077	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.0423279432822	And God bless America.
0.0	0.236461740931	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.374475955629	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.438179476033	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.477342808095	And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.
0.0	0.264916394823	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.297043007535	Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name.
0.0	0.243528838501	I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom.

0.0	0.385664287771	People have been paying it for years.
0.0	0.52442839877	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.0108298714373	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.36434958813	I said, "I don't need it.
0.0	0.462004154022	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.0797428222779	That's fine.
0.0	0.43868747762	Saudi Arabia without us is gone.
0.0	0.183189587686	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.377738923457	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.592098130021	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.474469734969	Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability.
0.0	0.119848115449	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.172187098473	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.512113905782	Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts.
0.0	0.357521964586	I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.
0.0	0.226347711639	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.478424081975	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.341667189038	Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate.
0.0	0.0659878408602	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.540931196988	Then, in 2008, you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying that we don't need those regulations on the federal level and now you're coming back around here.
0.0	0.336275591111	Do we still have standards?

0.0	0.567231211354	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.204286505727	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.315613067546	I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...
1.0	0.831230595779	And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.
0.0	0.338922427383	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.429986851274	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.
0.0	0.538692702331	But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.
0.0	0.450159577651	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.118409831202	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.553208528659	These are often very long- term kinds of investments that have to be made.

0.0	0.590515623216	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.310603561622	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.302016900571	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.0612785582841	I was the architect.

0.0	0.5	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.5	And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina, and many other Republican states, that because of their right wing political ideology, are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act.
1.0	0.661677103962	People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.

0.0	0.367601723271	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.0278667568372	That's really nice.

0.0	0.166475233453	Could we have your support?
0.0	0.20550009759	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.458724310426	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.

0.0	0.255676932797	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.245648525127	David, I am the very first...
0.0	0.443780324997	For example, it is outrageous that we don't have an opportunity for Medicare to negotiate for lower prices.
0.0	0.589363657639	But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.150042825325	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.

0.0	0.36528049692	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.0332592896233	That's crony capitalism.
0.0	0.468093478008	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.52201333508	I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures.
0.0	0.383777875912	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...

0.0	0.422390144837	So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.

0.0	0.36951649868	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.445807554828	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...

0.0	0.312621615487	First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.
0.0	0.515226012876	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.36748258102	And second of all...
0.0	0.5	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.492101840808	In the 1980s, it was in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Reagan's administration, and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel, and others were murdered.
0.0	0.487509619049	So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.
0.0	0.266898661192	Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.
0.0	0.102956720013	We're dying.

0.0	0.422498687525	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
0.0	0.346112277739	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.

0.0	0.460028828878	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.630665186084	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.174599240032	Now they're going militarily.
0.0	0.25382454379	I don't need the rhetoric.
0.0	0.11157408307	We listen to you and -- and then we act.
0.0	0.126446503297	That's what I said.

0.0	0.476560814653	I -- you know, know that Senator Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers.
0.0	0.293127821849	I would just...
0.0	0.244949340209	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.102501332485	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.600715979583	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.159839996181	Please think of our founding fathers as you listen.
0.0	0.476690008643	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.412323836156	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.102829454785	Came out great.
0.0	0.59100361053	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.307505125914	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.562434036685	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.0236280858324	It's not crass.
0.0	0.232216606794	You can have him.
0.0	0.0297125818697	Yes.
0.0	0.262443884387	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.101161089954	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.0328753662866	They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
0.0	0.172136989457	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
0.0	0.5	And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.
0.0	0.512274786462	When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it.
0.0	0.176918079727	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.156103727464	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.359400048833	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
0.0	0.5	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.528258146498	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.0242624702518	And guess what?
0.0	0.140148983912	We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
0.0	0.0984985701927	I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
0.0	0.361127855513	Yes, well, roughly.
1.0	0.925088359838	In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.
0.0	0.373513741842	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.468474955781	We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
0.0	0.563614576853	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.290201967294	But look, we didn't know what was happening next.
0.0	0.219257904901	I never said that.
0.0	0.144031067039	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.459831544515	And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.
0.0	0.904648168982	No.
0.0	0.434265291345	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.0304524211386	What would we do if this were ebola?
0.0	0.617316315332	But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.
0.0	0.658127670293	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.353733685005	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.211792440495	I would just say that...
0.0	0.0749051801988	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.5	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.380495216777	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.576568204508	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.47162392803	I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
0.0	0.38103508288	... and I encourage everybody watching this tonight to please, acknowledge that by going online at martinomalley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism.
0.0	0.339130931207	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.274507947539	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.279869600305	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
0.0	0.246028163436	I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here...
0.0	0.469525764047	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
0.0	0.105045220991	That's not true.
0.0	0.904066851883	What do we do?
0.0	0.328487005456	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.32966581064	And the answer is: Because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda.
0.0	0.556070691246	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.0788985090963	They all have jobs.
0.0	0.0690957986901	We get Bergdahl.
0.0	0.340734376757	No, what I would say is this is look, I was the first of the three of us to call for America to accept the 65,000 refugees we were asked to accept.
0.0	0.623514221851	It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.
1.0	0.403131369179	You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small.
0.0	0.233398409626	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.422365280044	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.316887370008	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.579125167888	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
1.0	0.869916149588	There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign.
0.0	0.340201559167	They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.
0.0	0.0424704892701	And you know what?
0.0	0.116575218925	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.535787197688	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
0.0	0.404500652472	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.162655741301	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.207766984093	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.461064418326	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.217682001178	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.171279912548	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.33575742531	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.446668973453	But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn't cut and run.
0.0	0.289300573475	Listen, we can solve immigration.
0.0	0.607182226282	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.381865783199	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.35083791746	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.581079013242	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.348255016384	I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.
0.0	0.358251611007	So what I had to do then is go back and start working on a bill that wasn't the bill that I wanted.
0.0	0.430281910819	The world has changed.
0.0	0.5	But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything.
0.0	0.904454749899	But what...
0.0	0.569736644285	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.344044119331	We must anticipate these threats before they happen.
0.0	0.0996985631543	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.481688775062	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.491214863525	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.0606749883698	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.0841111866191	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.544293485494	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.307586147731	I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...
0.0	0.258047186764	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.553553754795	But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America.
0.0	0.417237359497	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.388797448551	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.404080314771	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.331946470195	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.0188208088994	Ford.
0.0	0.217882430533	It ain't complicated.
0.0	0.22280024337	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.5	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.154643641809	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.30125058455	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.00406959926605	Thank you, John.
0.0	0.588421949047	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	0.544107711776	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.11658284503	We overcame the NRA's objections.
0.0	0.903872371984	I was not at all.
0.0	0.398486288626	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.100364495744	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.224727269073	And we should be a welcoming nation.
0.0	0.469893603709	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.357243431711	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.5	And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.
0.0	0.310782750236	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.480907738422	What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.
0.0	0.566595646532	And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.
0.0	0.51585821819	Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values.
0.0	0.154869765069	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.343189516974	May I respond?
0.0	0.277893447125	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.221098409179	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.386011864124	to save a company.
0.0	0.121892970886	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.42365196626	We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States.
0.0	0.406981700345	I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.
0.0	0.126112612044	That's not right.
0.0	0.157157005999	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.360814453717	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.202222284231	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.904066851883	What do we do?
0.0	0.336040976502	Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody.
0.0	0.249403541037	But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.
0.0	0.229856150648	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.433877390276	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.452337724684	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.45755898999	It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably -- probably -- from the Middle East.
0.0	0.207353636531	I'm using my own money.
0.0	0.442540167632	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.288085327122	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
0.0	0.228263622687	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.
0.0	0.440436102813	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.313752470697	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.376447418333	And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it.
0.0	0.0180215807172	...John...
0.0	0.476796498466	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.0742345644271	I want to thank the people of Iowa for being so welcoming to me.
0.0	0.291693045567	And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.
0.0	0.371125575823	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.249094572224	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.151909431341	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.111510238281	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.505213051511	We have three children, eight, five and one.
0.0	0.349413598129	I said temporarily.
1.0	0.434466829123	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.438009095399	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.126359607749	That's right.
0.0	0.571226471868	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.494469973678	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.249229959714	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.394660649693	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.263183182597	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
0.0	0.423817681046	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.249057868083	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.260361726147	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.469834629976	China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.191545258521	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.300736450066	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.355878456543	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.57308383523	And, unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage, I actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.106227527843	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.312077197903	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.477842784108	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.426538267473	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.456368337049	We need security.
0.0	0.512724224509	I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not.
0.0	0.435433025216	We need to end minimal sentencing.
0.0	0.0237163281134	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.0789458259796	But here's what's going to happen:
0.0	0.485751692722	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.373437237879	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.245445072243	My oldest daughter's a teacher.
0.0	0.589652117846	They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care.
0.0	0.605979681364	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.447778747174	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.34413198144	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.175371061205	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.527082402261	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.2069115056	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.640130572604	But here, a total net worth of -- net worth, not assets, not -- a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets -- Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York -- many other places all over the world.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.0829512158091	Reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.514087505829	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.0908134777779	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.394081931937	But I'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya, you would be looking at Syria.
0.0	0.518548232682	Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.
0.0	0.227857006263	I'll keep -- I'll keep heading in that direction, believe me.
0.0	0.352587052766	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.291453798685	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.477111437715	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.398860265388	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.331009479713	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.153744094065	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.0982658568706	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.607738883223	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.904648168982	How?
0.0	0.456521896154	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.470633750541	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.427144191398	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.413020394015	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.
0.0	0.213695211074	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.460140310819	As president, I would make the administrator of USAID an actual cabinet member.
0.0	0.487165656422	We only have one or two.
0.0	0.428547450329	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.0182675756924	Absolutely.
0.0	0.417881506374	I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader.
0.0	0.58093855423	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.241331380928	We don't need that.
0.0	0.36404967922	The list goes on because the differences are so stark.
0.0	0.589427082481	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.489093364583	Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take.
0.0	0.489670505963	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
0.0	0.411281011413	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.603824356298	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
1.0	0.91953529085	Very few children.
0.0	0.099295792152	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.38752068374	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.379811170017	We'll be filing it right on time.
0.0	0.25176890894	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.465741631022	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.
0.0	0.16880843577	It's Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.
0.0	0.515078578397	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.0364757899047	Neil?
0.0	0.2441948757	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.180280193319	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.655290242092	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.
0.0	0.40224723431	When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal?
0.0	0.366175040338	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.279884718672	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.13046295338	That is important.
0.0	0.232216606794	We can do that.
0.0	0.522553089646	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.141246097479	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.397752948313	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.904648168982	But...
1.0	0.391686964683	And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent.
0.0	0.382501593147	We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.
0.0	0.448743858557	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.452276639826	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.100691385784	He was vibrant.
0.0	0.139611426546	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.222438592148	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.

0.0	0.217953248814	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.429923686698	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.

0.0	0.213083742835	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.338499780484	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.

0.0	0.252776425397	All of us want equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.635683013307	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
0.0	0.283795846979	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.
0.0	0.407972391579	... First of all -- Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.

0.0	0.319235731452	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.
0.0	0.51518404366	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
0.0	0.482464409241	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.5	And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty.
0.0	0.545820401696	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.526165961979	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.617327580717	And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.
0.0	0.318844939828	Give people a chance.
0.0	0.258845392608	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.

0.0	0.438059013147	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.

0.0	0.544646098482	Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.

0.0	0.529798819782	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.510622188127	I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation.

0.0	0.455491327856	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.163492226592	Predominantly African-American and Hispanic.
0.0	0.0596078981064	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.535595359728	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.467566574796	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.405727194158	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
1.0	0.740560843561	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.585088012172	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.197061208833	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.193668841801	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.439780321002	I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.
0.0	0.130248646406	We ended up with 56 votes.
0.0	0.340955077102	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.480334984216	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.201827126393	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.464201015195	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.261765638917	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.443566312929	Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.
0.0	0.340211257964	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.184930868053	It's called the politics.
0.0	0.350132006306	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
0.0	0.522756763671	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.90484123543	...
0.0	0.0242771295086	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.356507338633	We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.
0.0	0.411876460756	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.225358213431	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.433229992752	I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
0.0	0.441050582906	Fifty-one percent of high school African-American graduates are unemployed or underemployed.
0.0	0.230277812603	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.351666868002	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.476491502411	Millions coming out of school as you indicated, deeply in debt.
0.0	0.321516906392	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.470495067175	And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it.
0.0	0.529507785099	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.246573796498	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.413980773343	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.212683762959	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.275266742459	He said, "Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."
0.0	0.188288566908	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.605780617552	It was the most highly sought after -- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
0.0	0.5	The number of women --
0.0	0.179194431207	I don't care.
0.0	0.0168331285323	): Secretary...
0.0	0.382865578061	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.423743032454	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.545896743161	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.418596407456	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.555014781211	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.533523720063	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.203157781821	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.398746627393	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.349189053401	He's the greatest show on earth.
0.0	0.556351960598	And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.583831072299	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.0937136119219	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.061912732069	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.537108837412	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.441040968815	We ought to send used equipment, right?
0.0	0.228256238093	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.466599146069	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.0877808930731	You looking at me?
0.0	0.0238753447898	Think about it.
0.0	0.143647786077	The bill would involve legalization.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.313708181677	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.365172416456	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
1.0	0.872046143767	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.454402213186	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.166253241977	I think we're missing the point here.
0.0	0.113050349923	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.4551581496	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.655501713897	Wall Street today has too much political power.
0.0	0.46894360533	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.420453821639	... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience.
0.0	0.216927702555	So, your original question is the right question.
0.0	0.366897504441	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.308716484588	Like, I'm standing here, I -- I watched the video of Senator Cruz.
0.0	0.296221946171	And we have to stop all the divisions.
0.0	0.235781853829	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.560112977126	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.904648168982	But...
0.0	0.658142252374	What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the Muslim nations in that region who are going to have to fight and defend their way of life.
0.0	0.546498225114	I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of State, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now.
0.0	0.164142822036	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.346220918171	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.
0.0	0.267941732748	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.565147265646	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.452440693327	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.111763206288	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.327947838026	We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels.
0.0	0.478709092418	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.581837445272	And for my part, I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has.
0.0	0.199425151569	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.428766233717	I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out.
1.0	0.515657480791	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.402899621576	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.191450491148	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.418986050948	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.380116879958	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.385274562419	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.308259936281	I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.
0.0	0.0424034417377	We were wrong.
0.0	0.190082587789	That's what the political revolution is about.
0.0	0.5	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.488757936307	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.190736475958	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.528964247637	They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.

0.0	0.494256479507	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
0.0	0.505582451627	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.

0.0	0.00528671421851	Yeah.
0.0	0.288724878753	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.350542934294	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.446473352096	Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.535534147967	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.400260374564	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.405353278838	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.5	I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.
0.0	0.423390467966	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.361500036111	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.475892148854	And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.
0.0	0.148342027063	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.466615112052	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.346344744229	But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
0.0	0.531598833887	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.566428790907	When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.
0.0	0.388772038588	We now finally are where we need to be.
0.0	0.254590481091	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.260398189544	David, let me give you a little bit of background here.
0.0	0.466456115029	He's actually a negative force.
0.0	0.344751029138	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.473689255476	And so people are still going to get health care, thankfully, in emergency rooms, in hospitals.
0.0	0.480462620635	You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down.
0.0	0.540311885686	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.391711882537	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
0.0	0.0278957548388	We have losers.
0.0	0.528656896095	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.0825263693545	They have no choice.
0.0	0.380292868135	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.391416880283	I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.183353124215	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.
0.0	0.379133982775	Well, we did have a plan, and I think it's fair to say that of all of the Arab leaders, Gaddafi probably had more blood on his hands of Americans than anybody else.
0.0	0.138518385774	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.5	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
0.0	0.472327242427	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.648040536922	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.159300988702	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.358256209002	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.361924958222	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.0608394343584	This is absolutely absurd.
0.0	0.481436011147	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.457768658309	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.465411160501	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.0364757899047	Neil...
0.0	0.409128821669	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.411869202955	You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.
0.0	0.309878076902	I want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, which they have not been doing.
0.0	0.523674496288	We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.
0.0	0.40499777807	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.417003294742	You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.
0.0	0.399778538874	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.469870883328	It has too much economic power.
1.0	0.79187329608	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
1.0	0.5	When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.543269621476	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.508992728298	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.291982074218	So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.
0.0	0.904454749899	It was...
0.0	0.510365032832	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.582585357435	And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.
0.0	0.143569501609	Well, they're glitches because...
0.0	0.312049837078	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.354771009427	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.521630857535	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.533894378052	We have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as General Dempsey said.
0.0	0.204159778738	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.345979039487	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.100842147303	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.330767254428	I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college.
0.0	0.295751232902	I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party's nominee.
0.0	0.357943095131	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.232927084897	Everybody got out -- and they kept our equipment.
0.0	0.258450899204	And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a -- that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.
0.0	0.54275465807	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.258535197712	I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria.
0.0	0.220763222064	Well, sure.
0.0	0.551068574389	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.5	So, in terms of refugees, I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe, with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that, of course, we reach out.
0.0	0.0179843377053	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.460251674581	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.613527956498	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.548104337148	Or a young woman who had been performing at President Obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member.
0.0	0.391962485162	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.52908094786	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.283352193108	But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting.
0.0	0.273745924492	We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.
0.0	0.377767220386	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
0.0	0.251624830399	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.401761993884	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.170380373455	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.0957588158583	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.0775251549399	That's the difference.
0.0	0.0601672962718	He's very upset.
0.0	0.33286694013	Secretary Clinton also said we -- it was not just the invasion of Iraq which Secretary Clinton voted for and has since said was a big mistake -- and, indeed, it was.
0.0	0.647003719387	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.287587261105	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.260433677856	You know, Ted didn't show up.
1.0	0.800889160968	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.522578244859	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.459872753649	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.284828271835	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.284118975671	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.
0.0	0.489995211987	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.435132014019	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.112940925522	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.273631470148	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.346072321974	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.302160702796	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.523292681035	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.200128132324	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.175046869492	Got to be on the floor of the Senate.
1.0	0.527427031104	But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.
0.0	0.115124826782	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.5	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.515560500631	Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top.
0.0	0.126854840558	Right.
0.0	0.346187843429	Support community banks and credit unions.
0.0	0.556343798526	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.
0.0	0.485785796444	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.90484123543	...
0.0	0.0972639262914	Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.
0.0	0.0162520026935	So we have a disagreement on this.
1.0	0.617554678624	According to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.554972677165	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.266069293035	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.362620575669	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.180222703131	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.126854840558	Right?
0.0	0.0345527904608	He's very charming.
0.0	0.316873734626	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.229264220053	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.5	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.00574055984678	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.21009466039	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.223068234489	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.
0.0	0.360372430113	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.509556512555	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.

0.0	0.305118724481	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.0598104348759	Divide that out.
0.0	0.579346734521	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.596158495841	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.423169883732	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.313560947331	A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.
0.0	0.205098491871	So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.
0.0	0.608159523831	I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.
0.0	0.341424921903	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.214947118188	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.51362714616	We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.
0.0	0.425252088783	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.439330039651	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.235771370601	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.351893783227	It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible.
0.0	0.42752274218	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.190570987383	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.374769808322	Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
0.0	0.372059395373	Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense.
1.0	0.493919102372	We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.277324529968	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.380965775963	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.418539408992	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.0790624370275	I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.374077882721	Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.
0.0	0.509874062467	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.245322405504	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.563519422757	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.414667485502	You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.
0.0	0.387369525099	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.0512791349584	It's what they call it.
0.0	0.108477324735	You get a lot of them that are overrated.
0.0	0.47434155944	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.591915248534	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.403843712772	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.600558134485	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.0919580325216	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.0102266104981	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.154469880253	If they want to accept our values and our laws.
0.0	0.614899478281	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.0768959402135	Check it out.
0.0	0.377233137394	... ground and air.
1.0	0.90371215143	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.237498898951	Folks, it's not too late.
0.0	0.538209161144	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.343412034324	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.465626580006	You have a problem with ISIS.
0.0	0.221874255634	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.147714126734	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.372824118669	Please become part of the political revolution.
0.0	0.377513983303	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.446548019725	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.0307419355601	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.405303155012	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.33794191716	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.0297125818697	Yes.
0.0	0.218892343724	We needed 60.
0.0	0.112605383288	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.455350928302	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.0424034417377	They were wrong.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.51274533991	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.362640940326	But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.
0.0	0.218024456456	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.332491391734	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
0.0	0.0803137476962	But Secretary Clinton is wrong.
0.0	0.209842582255	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.475954514773	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.362904159892	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.246086838522	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.5	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
0.0	0.157990919433	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.0957688587294	We've gotten off the Hillary's e-mails, good.
0.0	0.304823058644	Can I just say this...
0.0	0.452694604017	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.353555140578	I need your help.
0.0	0.522863670199	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.
0.0	0.0506206793269	They're a scam.
0.0	0.427485331518	This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.
0.0	0.347081610443	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.35289089506	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.371875358517	... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do.
0.0	0.369621925995	All of that together, we're going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.
0.0	0.472343625686	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.40159046744	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.518066220694	We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.
0.0	0.516474456831	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.491721877786	But it was also the cascading effects that followed that.
0.0	0.389681947181	The central question in this race is trust.
0.0	0.277414121424	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.26908511623	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.143558335605	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.198433052466	I think this is a very difficult issue.
0.0	0.5	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.433542928164	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.410745140743	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.49164062319	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.00189211836147	Okay, thank you.
0.0	0.351136084246	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.42412367538	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.3503028742	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.513084615177	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.549413742947	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.320442764327	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.57711993807	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.429894127581	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.
0.0	0.485482538322	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.0404374137005	DICKERSON: A question from Kathie Obradovich.
0.0	0.532308396348	When somebody is addicted and seeking help, they should not have to wait three, four months in order to get that help.
0.0	0.446358892705	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.377145736168	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.305894683592	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.479478282998	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.546847240133	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.189993261651	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.5	And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.
0.0	0.434315805977	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.522923463579	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.
1.0	0.538854371417	And some of them are like third world countries.
0.0	0.20601783914	Doctors are quitting.
0.0	0.613736661001	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.
0.0	0.466366021182	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.505283115578	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.470203766483	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.532428447639	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.5	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.240371115979	They wanted Boeing's secrets.
0.0	0.395682385553	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.218910563037	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.18934143404	He's weak on immigration.
0.0	0.591761039736	You can -- you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.
0.0	0.385206654317	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.24597928506	We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.
0.0	0.376750755123	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.532735775773	And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.
0.0	0.42412388864	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.0591524305225	I didn't.
0.0	0.5	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.0618557512711	... not everybody else.
0.0	0.337171304945	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.479599869811	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.199260854034	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.370138359871	So -- because we got to make the country rich.
0.0	0.516260834201	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.383408155731	And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.
0.0	0.327933727346	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.569194953548	It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.
0.0	0.423739731765	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.337200919594	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.47352293819	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.561942210805	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.203157781821	But let's be clear.
0.0	0.398328265867	Number two, we had a really good plan.
0.0	0.0735756370282	I'm really rich.
0.0	0.397800353972	We need, basically, to pledge that we're going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.
0.0	0.555839539754	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.546679226331	We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
0.0	0.0435625828642	The answer is no.
0.0	0.333415541191	I don't think anyone has a magical solution.
0.0	0.519968419038	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.566637016054	... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.
0.0	0.112969193333	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.377611459467	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.1378547318	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.172046596497	You don't hear it from anybody else.
0.0	0.362744659844	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.677862530332	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.490056144712	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.

0.0	0.315731871323	I'll give you another example.
0.0	0.5	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.183030012852	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
0.0	0.524362540563	For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check.
0.0	0.462980526742	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.473739540286	There's too much -- it's like -- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
0.0	0.199214921846	They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work.
0.0	0.560206252822	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.636539611918	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.354485353886	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.215729879759	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.269460114304	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.349379579727	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
0.0	0.2666625943	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
0.0	0.0385193263297	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.170740129512	We talked about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.514717301898	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.435727047555	So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has.
0.0	0.214685616285	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.51418801937	But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.
0.0	0.312931959884	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.540392586873	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.570835323008	They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.514422973274	So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.
1.0	0.853503254311	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.222026693598	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.361315778434	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.0458624351188	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.485705212569	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.00528671421851	Yeah.
0.0	0.347896312763	Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope.
0.0	0.5	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.35998369383	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.0180618571737	John.
0.0	0.275707155124	Now, it's very interesting.
0.0	0.454577464533	And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.
0.0	0.285970426041	See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together.
0.0	0.439135128889	Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
0.0	0.379047716452	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.522705832208	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.20531115412	This is a complicated issue.
0.0	0.463468779514	We must able to work collaboratively with others.
0.0	0.467571460818	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.0795915106035	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.587966169337	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.
0.0	0.423144132533	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
0.0	0.541251572622	I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks.
0.0	0.51775148464	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.460496532601	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.346167309764	Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.0741812773982	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.391699466412	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.293270989074	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.399879295821	I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.
0.0	0.904066851883	It was against Assad.
0.0	0.404715354373	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.0655939127074	Let me...
0.0	0.0309732133435	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.440215160849	Now, our country needs -- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
0.0	0.074128236986	See?
0.0	0.228007969069	And that's what I will do as your president.
0.0	0.356332617638	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
1.0	0.467588830357	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.0297125818697	Yes.
0.0	0.222555967337	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.403532035715	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.111425640981	My plan is there.
0.0	0.0189689100614	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.0617298943582	That's American citizenship.
0.0	0.50964736247	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.5	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.284632069876	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.201078512902	You want to know why things don't get done in Washington?
0.0	0.390220998553	That is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.
0.0	0.618635568741	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.33407327575	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.424915845813	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.511923881749	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.563004973141	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy.
0.0	0.220050922462	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.415917887905	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
0.0	0.277854807374	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.368713980399	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.441191031579	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.458015133735	The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...
0.0	0.516161501083	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.
0.0	0.276206042044	They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.
0.0	0.904454749899	I do.
0.0	0.0300776406036	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.217795026732	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.384939795472	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.109632019994	...the only reason is -- look...
0.0	0.328322271532	My daughters went to college on a mountain of bills.
0.0	0.173972350021	It won't happen.
0.0	0.0721678683887	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.354047679466	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.442007001099	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.5	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.616411264327	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.515752083365	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.550894296274	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
1.0	0.484408236397	And the overall message is that it doesn't result in job loss.
0.0	0.348172181442	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
1.0	0.799156107877	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.244544909276	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.0910903034419	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.261315812691	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.23396652277	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.25129170362	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.356840094857	And I'll tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign.
0.0	0.347109186249	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.516530420434	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.383638732387	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.468259411887	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.435782935296	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.472975006563	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.411457025875	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.396743839903	Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.370665227205	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.418936539502	And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.
0.0	0.689353670753	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.078051900172	She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship.
0.0	0.640590737449	We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...
0.0	0.210643066195	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.632230856396	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.647749900668	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.569311849713	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.594204028049	But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.
0.0	0.284588706907	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.310162083196	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.263547267645	I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.
1.0	0.912708553483	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.233620253279	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.248599036661	There's been no crowd like this.
0.0	0.280872120848	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.336502288705	As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
0.0	0.483104863939	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.478234664836	The United States has, unfortunately, been victimized by terrorism going back decades.
0.0	0.367156560864	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.57671488036	We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.
0.0	0.387880917337	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.904454749899	I have.
0.0	0.258006426145	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.470379132507	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.478880744504	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.548688166345	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.535412037944	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.489741917991	And, of course, I met the mothers of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, and Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and so many of them who have lost their children.
0.0	0.54467139595	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.526260938109	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.119002911228	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.252665050821	You know why three?
0.0	0.555137609918	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.126359607749	That's right.
0.0	0.286854441889	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.5	Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin.
1.0	0.846075482441	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.602599132645	If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.
0.0	0.5	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.555896845875	We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that's what's keeping him contained.
0.0	0.371026851107	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.230601741271	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.524812532477	We have to go after what is called the shadow banking industry.
0.0	0.203249164189	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.423432707786	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.458814854891	Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world.
0.0	0.580757763441	$2.5 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world.
0.0	0.536200483894	Seventeen more million more people have health care.
0.0	0.427532303507	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.530706228488	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.48986104769	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.297055616644	Martha, if I may...
0.0	0.545321170909	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.365747684646	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.
0.0	0.553906529593	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.453979600737	We have the U.N. Security Council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path.
0.0	0.623474415203	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.259539864227	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.485001680784	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.34752894998	Please go to hillaryclinton.com and be part of making this country what we know it can and should be.
0.0	0.382201234012	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.097504561213	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.590733403644	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.350471825671	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.275777276186	I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.
0.0	0.381980502626	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.105537723804	I gotta do it, Dad.
0.0	0.298218762073	I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?
0.0	0.457998973197	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.510897615507	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.081774008839	No, Martha, I would not.
0.0	0.455663868676	I think that is the number one requirement.
0.0	0.351505444398	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.351180294541	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.526977367	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.333141467682	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.274066624174	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.904648168982	No.
0.0	0.178186822928	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.903482347978	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.0183224443913	OK.
0.0	0.564496250014	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.143672264096	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.22169386499	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.610541649142	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.35732765352	The people don't work for us.
0.0	0.40153426435	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.37757843491	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.0780388216414	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.212881055104	People that know me, like me.
0.0	0.400446174112	And America's best days are in front of us if we move forward together.
0.0	0.201847909893	We need to know who our neighbors are.
1.0	0.531110061674	John -- John, this country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.545802633813	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.310491592738	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.219257904901	I never said that.
0.0	0.0557740784829	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.539148275066	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.442128465825	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.599963160558	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
0.0	0.240575575543	In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
0.0	0.0474573383725	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.218478899865	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.130209132355	So, so important.
0.0	0.0732077727588	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.125208219824	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.275528041209	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.486488331822	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.332527646588	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.0250048376432	They knew that.
0.0	0.010245715172	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.5	Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day.
0.0	0.161406504459	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.
0.0	0.43557285973	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.506213342494	My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.
1.0	0.875718068388	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.4352843241	And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.
0.0	0.10061869662	Look what they did in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.316679416381	He cut and run.
0.0	0.251324179667	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.595971683914	So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
0.0	0.307434397662	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.470856712445	And those countries who are opposed to Islam, they are going to have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today.
0.0	0.11487115327	I changed that.
0.0	0.157001777922	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.17569109519	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.131228604639	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.5	So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out.
0.0	0.088829267885	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.221427538809	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.0620213179315	That's not the America that I think we should be.
0.0	0.531222842308	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.292374239633	Now, I understand that this is very difficult.
0.0	0.20867821412	We got nothing but problems.
0.0	0.391010189645	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.344519901764	Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild.
0.0	0.217078278577	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.0925811384275	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.493847437468	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.586264504015	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.235483562587	We have made some good progress.
0.0	0.358286318646	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.0347305345659	That's who I'm indebted to.
0.0	0.478750025375	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.574287619029	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.0908937348762	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.107372938175	He'll say.
0.0	0.356009923114	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.517856619779	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
1.0	0.752385515761	What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons.
0.0	0.281698179545	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.487521640545	So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.
0.0	0.301500976118	All of us believe climate change is real.
0.0	0.236197969294	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.300353211316	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.0945384239347	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.308871750985	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.32001029408	If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship.
0.0	0.12571033019	And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.
0.0	0.470673110153	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
0.0	0.0954820555032	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.41757940579	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.35329205559	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.149056149097	I know the overrated ones.
0.0	0.567002944145	Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.410053205072	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.294485463075	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.
0.0	0.506560164814	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.390363795356	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.151790399524	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.444371697646	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
1.0	0.878878767322	Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world.
0.0	0.491765119072	What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people.
0.0	0.554426673438	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.313833217195	And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.
0.0	0.26741332548	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.587610876608	And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.
0.0	0.406072925866	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.
0.0	0.0408713668683	You do legislation.
0.0	0.298719724151	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.383826031929	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.100516011293	We know about the French.
0.0	0.44296288936	You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying.
0.0	0.356933988457	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.29261406362	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.205707657809	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.259446857665	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.618049304847	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.126019260624	Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.90484123543	...
0.0	0.237153508855	It is a tragedy all over this country.
0.0	0.201954713949	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.39749688049	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.478100973636	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.401350520199	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.427930130328	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.260772237248	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.0182675756924	Absolutely.
0.0	0.904066851883	And here's why.
0.0	0.301941057273	I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video.
0.0	0.461675255482	I am not the candidate of Wall Street...
0.0	0.338470226632	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.280555263213	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.274743358683	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.339457138746	I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis.
0.0	0.551258498844	The DNC has hired vendors.
0.0	0.340391830938	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.0233087801142	Everybody should.
0.0	0.606203816193	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.52874474919	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.223832948067	We saw what happened in Egypt.
0.0	0.465695962289	No, both the federal and a state approach.
0.0	0.46669662764	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
1.0	0.0122223280589	They stole it.
0.0	0.65630401212	It was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up.
1.0	0.273320525509	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.0887390460191	I think he is right.
0.0	0.00878597976931	And we are not England.
0.0	0.0492417245406	Oh, great.
0.0	0.300146506603	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.170516606707	And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth.
0.0	0.306923161652	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.318449602283	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.215989204865	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.219246966125	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.345649773629	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.477820273448	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.304829723211	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.313295896845	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.540074105957	Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us.
0.0	0.550547599185	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.583173884047	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.584964016177	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.434615391853	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.20864051179	That's just media stuff.
0.0	0.52813692618	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.0793658925525	Both served.
0.0	0.109013733888	I like them.
0.0	0.232216606794	You can do both.
0.0	0.0238753447898	Think of it.
0.0	0.250372214948	It was a different situation in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.246551869096	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.343189516974	May I respond?
0.0	0.268440623456	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.539339537748	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.0935504348866	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.541198634016	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.265677728071	Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.
0.0	0.367049255756	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.549300705947	The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.
0.0	0.226591896847	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.5	Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.369215082559	When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it.
0.0	0.150602882326	Yes, exactly, exactly.
1.0	0.381446975476	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.287867133401	We need to figure this out together.
0.0	0.217405526134	I have a problem with that, Martha.
0.0	0.182680841157	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.351652820541	And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce's great story.
0.0	0.59760620887	We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government.
0.0	0.520571724004	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.511455517515	And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring.
0.0	0.122898573325	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.0424704892701	But you know what?
0.0	0.456969611424	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.233716708447	That can be done.
0.0	0.310963105568	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.
0.0	0.479383837036	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.553882936179	As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.122389031018	I voted against the war.
0.0	0.198265744461	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.62197012112	Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico.
0.0	0.248855401821	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.220981928728	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.464074068846	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.0676399430366	You're right about that.
0.0	0.0424704892701	And you know what?
0.0	0.167581834363	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.548672387736	... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region.
0.0	0.103559523478	That's kind of a no-brainer.
0.0	0.423623326139	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.0142983605693	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.525519837549	And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
0.0	0.399778538874	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.024578596507	It's not a bestseller.
0.0	0.33664336284	And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.
0.0	0.565969930526	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.32998063041	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.0994716817957	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.33909254956	This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along.
0.0	0.409769363319	There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out.
0.0	0.139703051577	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.423857029428	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.
0.0	0.5	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.40260898631	That means medical.
0.0	0.250799484725	You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that.
0.0	0.904648168982	No.
0.0	0.904260977693	That's it.
0.0	0.398850584674	But I have another one, Ford.
0.0	0.178250745237	How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
0.0	0.373406776418	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.240363291302	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.293450898781	That's a hard road to walk.
0.0	0.211095039641	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.176280540303	They're going to build in Mexico.
0.0	0.484758794769	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.236145781654	It's real estate.
0.0	0.171727851967	But you don't hear that from anybody else.
0.0	0.357373632983	But it cannot be an American fight.
0.0	0.407486949497	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
0.0	0.412756000213	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.623127814955	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.376377099849	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.298914492587	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.393349472008	... first of all...
0.0	0.439401805143	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.589606184306	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.441093522667	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.
0.0	0.476214258835	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.248514325616	Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.
0.0	0.264454379941	Hillary doesn't want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her.
0.0	0.386331708985	We can build the fence.
0.0	0.321398994541	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.134717637122	Don't know that.
0.0	0.221563934293	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.466268659337	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.26525060462	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.380860116701	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.126854840558	Right.
0.0	0.258393571343	But people have to be alert.
0.0	0.323353070328	I saw Ted Cruz say, "we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill."
0.0	0.0182675756924	Absolutely.
0.0	0.487820992796	We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America.
0.0	0.515685326245	We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.
0.0	0.290365442713	Never support.
0.0	0.653245548141	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.34027945237	So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
0.0	0.0975026205492	Did she do a great job?
0.0	0.119153301942	It's affordable for everybody.
0.0	0.481338978012	And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world.
0.0	0.203937895249	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.367420789836	I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization.
0.0	0.188198064282	You really can't.
0.0	0.303455605092	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.209646295278	It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state.
0.0	0.067922931798	You're right.
0.0	0.562449743195	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.263435965022	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.229422948735	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.117728222012	We don't want to be Sweden.
0.0	0.063045520231	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.
0.0	0.484428881046	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.354001409737	The intelligence was by no means absolute.
0.0	0.607471516161	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.560923193416	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.235174610506	They have to be alert to problems.
0.0	0.103322504212	Please reconsider, I'll say no.
0.0	0.466516193621	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.904066851883	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.143923114924	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.156122120868	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.393036413604	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.332629745078	Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
0.0	0.0343201179216	Oh, yes there is.
0.0	0.271989700286	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.5	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.239232895103	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.418837220722	First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.103181969787	I've always listened to you, Megyn.
0.0	0.335168742839	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.512642743215	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.470653461479	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.572806579311	And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms.
0.0	0.450310010751	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.190046351028	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
0.0	0.428126924205	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
0.0	0.475499198673	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
0.0	0.451170583459	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.397867384345	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.0613291022183	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.524286953944	I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment.
0.0	0.491082441397	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.593552112807	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
1.0	0.878800995757	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
0.0	0.50796976234	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.014454225091	...Chris...
0.0	0.487411560618	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
0.0	0.411692420308	But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you.
0.0	0.511822183951	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.0208906866107	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.30808647479	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.517074104517	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.529717306161	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.537266034186	You learn to create a security cabinet.
0.0	0.155435698671	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.293350936704	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.398065322692	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.381471357347	A military island.
0.0	0.449878841375	I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.
0.0	0.0527732024757	I got that.
0.0	0.526283324704	And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues.
0.0	0.572714206395	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
1.0	0.577056636852	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.519269476557	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.
0.0	0.227660691008	My point is this.
0.0	0.314499071577	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.153118604298	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.0474148288416	Look--
0.0	0.391215592756	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.273642282645	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.378855100575	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.140426599848	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.234905839637	They don't know how to bring it about.
0.0	0.450377339958	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.
0.0	0.544776291218	So it was not against ISIS, it was against -- it was against Assad.
0.0	0.426523551932	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.358363374196	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.
0.0	0.402686797069	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.
0.0	0.175705709723	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.556864607892	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.24043611818	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.431482920615	Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer.
0.0	0.239115987263	I had to borrow money to go to school.
1.0	0.382045826292	The 500,000 who came home with PTSD, and traumatic brain injury.
0.0	0.385819227057	So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly.
0.0	0.449241033093	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
0.0	0.19263635688	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
1.0	0.823810552592	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
0.0	0.514285605527	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.56098029889	I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider.
0.0	0.453960606197	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.437365351015	But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that.
0.0	0.0270441057784	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.170198796455	Look, I served on...
1.0	0.797828968461	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.334800386784	The Turks are being threatened.
0.0	0.455669862136	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.0105934925872	I love the Saudis.
0.0	0.35831653461	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.492467811487	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.577908575444	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.525709217915	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.191076994238	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.31229539579	When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.
0.0	0.621578414001	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.25822174152	And I think that's a mistake, and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways.
0.0	0.42618912825	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.186481654049	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.443384711019	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.0320934714649	But I was born here.
0.0	0.366341937188	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.0912584074994	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.405921976526	And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.
0.0	0.557943429517	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.3174223717	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.0636296754798	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.525492779003	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.375737065142	It cannot solely be America's fight.
0.0	0.577499248003	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.0526635797796	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.441199947514	If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration.
0.0	0.539533287948	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
1.0	0.841923530712	They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
0.0	0.212388651968	He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing?
0.0	0.115098504817	Not assets."
0.0	0.538572317806	And also -- also, what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health care outcomes are not necessarily that good.
0.0	0.418646068797	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.421717876139	They can provide resources.
0.0	0.449146120667	The no-fly zone, I would hope, would be also shared by Russia.
0.0	0.508850822931	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.312288458401	Bret, we're just starting.
0.0	0.346751251573	I didn't say permanently.
1.0	0.41964084013	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.376238838429	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.
0.0	0.26523494504	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.139258863256	Break them up.
0.0	0.345470074097	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.273268606942	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.315530368455	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.349864922242	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.308332685805	That's the right of people.
0.0	0.0882365161797	Again, with all do respect to Secretary Clinton...
0.0	0.0873849073028	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.339391198786	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.0717481299209	I think they'd want to hear it.
0.0	0.413566387551	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.108372051665	That is an egregious act.
0.0	0.530672889568	You know, on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign, I was in Keene, and I was asked what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?
0.0	0.145569528764	It's hate action.
0.0	0.364430994487	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.134717637122	He didn't know.
0.0	0.0556263791818	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.377425554667	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.354306990611	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.0499715213995	Then (inaudible)...
0.0	0.252490601468	Because now he's going a little bit better.
1.0	0.742930734449	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.309799328221	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.519972144762	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.439549795248	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.0595833125647	He's a progressive economist.
0.0	0.514560386732	And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.365183442771	A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this.
0.0	0.167939530012	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.286946933339	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.0194850552385	It's a joke.
0.0	0.248589064935	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
1.0	0.370778815811	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.214323087285	I've prosecuted terrorists.
0.0	0.484188060468	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
1.0	0.828888115118	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
0.0	0.441713753915	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.283375495371	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
1.0	0.398412552739	And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph).
0.0	0.470280654244	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.467046659519	... saying, no middle class tax raises.
0.0	0.350759757875	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.904066851883	What do we do?
0.0	0.438881047696	But if you place good ones, you pocket it.
0.0	0.541481569638	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.6244549599	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.188523191977	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.620517540283	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.186882988519	I know, Bret.
0.0	0.36398571483	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.419495257347	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.341371061331	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.467078607949	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.5	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.0794026538401	And I hear their speeches.
0.0	0.566420923394	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.430951584428	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
1.0	0.375838526816	They built a hotel.
0.0	0.267434883823	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.356950011876	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.573686814415	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.254546038125	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.
0.0	0.309657190945	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.339463880027	... people all over this country -- not you, Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other.
0.0	0.233872540648	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
0.0	0.142319057379	Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.482375878725	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.548602691192	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.442759039869	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.179194431207	I don't care.
0.0	2.04968611508e-05	Thank you.
0.0	0.5	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.105255925342	That's true.
0.0	0.521090940399	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.596077621049	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.388933069744	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.416233831664	But states need to do more as well.
0.0	0.118643789016	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.394486264849	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.0771807847736	This is an emergency.
0.0	0.147069840329	It's coming from more than Mexico.
0.0	0.216251137629	So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.
0.0	0.375490757218	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.558053077011	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.295404809679	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.5	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.297081239994	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.0906903916807	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.374475955629	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.25219248327	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.278440342513	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.54817604888	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.537922527159	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.375914393657	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.267787025673	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.485011969388	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.0569222546153	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.105045220991	That's not true.
0.0	0.430506508589	You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super PAC and they're advertising against me in Iowa as we speak.
0.0	0.364283451507	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
0.0	0.454471052789	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.224645364318	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.280001612636	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.23933763268	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.456532545406	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.035667017569	I have to tell you.
0.0	0.316552836741	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.355975742895	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.122014281134	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.0505846138047	Now I'm not doing that...I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?
0.0	0.357035484346	Ted can change his mind.
0.0	0.302975159939	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.557971111585	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.358352484664	You can change your mind.
0.0	0.494982832758	No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.
0.0	0.359170363942	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.446727526683	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.423100290874	The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.
0.0	0.394025928859	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?
0.0	0.163723917571	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.372102884673	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.521451215368	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.465784848395	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.212241718358	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.656054801211	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.583349020697	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
1.0	0.313857270361	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.289915269955	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.26926823066	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.00865075370563	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.462374792355	And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, "if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed.
0.0	0.570116075509	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.590910530363	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.49075804369	Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers.
0.0	0.328186292071	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.244544909276	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.361155748249	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.484550824961	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.293466144875	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.604342585012	When those buildings came down, she was trapped in her building and I didn't hear from her over six hours.
0.0	0.353512369947	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.177681844463	Go ahead.
0.0	0.449317021829	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.322203465099	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.444977373867	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.315111656014	... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
0.0	0.563904717601	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.35607177542	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.195404159684	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.340495940719	Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.
0.0	0.250447942855	I said, "They send it back?"
0.0	0.492842339854	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.532577967118	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.172286524094	Did a couple of cataract surgeries over Christmas holidays.
0.0	0.20454549622	That's a wonderful business model.
0.0	0.547545106621	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.421765124298	When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.61549369219	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.158114829554	The worker's out of a job.
1.0	0.840583200161	In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship.
0.0	0.0238222223224	They think they are.
0.0	0.485586838189	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.314885008212	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.00389891625095	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.49151740144	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.50697480633	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.0634124762181	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.571845553046	ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.
0.0	0.195084131762	Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem.
0.0	0.249115656475	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.206678517666	We've been at this a couple of years.
0.0	0.067922931798	You're right.
0.0	0.130656759042	She said the truth.
0.0	0.276039873487	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.589852677511	And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.
0.0	0.386917500174	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.34741321337	There will be a process.
0.0	0.199493524802	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.563020996868	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.382215452684	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.201485903576	When do we beat Mexico at the border?
0.0	0.561727392059	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.273621334101	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.520334247435	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.256688923425	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.399940036483	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
0.0	0.284448269478	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.45207793869	So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.
0.0	0.230058971421	He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
0.0	0.28292282931	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.152445192705	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.684429092931	And, also, acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration, and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners.
0.0	0.0974299894445	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.476202600413	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
1.0	0.833285091483	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.545080202547	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.400995554554	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.417745865929	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.18248792209	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.196095478894	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
1.0	0.927667638895	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.00979096693496	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.331888239613	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.209974500606	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.29121871499	Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy.
0.0	0.449258770902	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.421788708145	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.41829268872	But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.
0.0	0.439410370818	The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.
0.0	0.279676210557	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.

1.0	0.585033083164	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
0.0	0.468643623524	I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out.

0.0	0.61056987465	We didn't win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America.
0.0	0.333120022802	And we also need a cheerleader.
0.0	0.190975450875	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.432630832041	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.38844987263	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.407322036709	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.

0.0	0.418398898215	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.126854840558	Right.
0.0	0.477416975147	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.

0.0	0.549749854257	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.4501388449	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.0236145909155	So be very, very careful.
0.0	0.365901907706	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.442836133116	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.

0.0	0.394894760996	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.205395527507	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.513941152562	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.278508559225	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.

0.0	0.618085891193	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.426401790594	And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
0.0	0.267212295545	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.487425610404	And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.0433689026483	I happen to think...

0.0	0.3460980896	When you come back to me, I'll share that story.
0.0	0.440442482722	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.

0.0	0.148858048366	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.56372354421	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
1.0	0.489947758324	I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer.
0.0	0.421996008159	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
0.0	0.366922265579	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.245510617	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.

0.0	0.188112725504	Chris, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.265982289853	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.443533925746	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.0387216160413	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.332837151379	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.556679185922	And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.
0.0	0.161754291113	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.

0.0	0.597330927229	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.394485542593	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.118766242161	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.412829530025	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.

0.0	0.517296144699	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.210382469067	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.538793244784	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.517481225219	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.297361265177	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.439515092183	Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions?
0.0	0.428569454073	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.609658185339	Furthermore, in a competitive global economy, it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world.
0.0	0.384666679846	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.358000254025	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.175702989236	We want to build on it and fix it.
0.0	0.139940870956	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.154355107781	I say, "That's a terrible story.

0.0	0.270373071648	They've become rich.
0.0	0.214115448954	Well, I think it's pretty clear that they know that I will.
0.0	0.346725293526	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.430552225285	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.264371208594	Now, you'd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me?
0.0	0.175622765453	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.

0.0	0.410949763554	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.291901090788	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.223103349175	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
0.0	0.242729079622	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.376470098639	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.442903809759	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.430864336838	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.

0.0	0.440133709293	We can have debt-free college in the United States.
0.0	0.304128865191	We need much more than that.
0.0	0.0527362940268	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.126854840558	Right.
0.0	0.343973363787	Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble.
0.0	0.5	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.410592411676	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.426715335455	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
0.0	0.380690239133	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.237573902372	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.578207185712	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.323563969312	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.22274569766	Sadly, the American dream is dead.
0.0	0.491221288319	We have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information.
1.0	0.526120326223	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.363611991235	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.36618826013	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.609257907803	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.293035760531	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.265297325654	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.462825055893	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
0.0	0.318356060438	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.361290696534	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.5	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.

0.0	0.0433209316933	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.457365829208	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.583951054049	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.
0.0	0.471412685625	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.121904035161	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.358433167194	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.436572242007	And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.
0.0	0.0510331884885	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.0826186658202	And Martha...
0.0	0.387745985796	Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable?
0.0	0.237587643666	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.414947324869	And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem.
0.0	0.111852967899	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.265375795885	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
1.0	0.50591025114	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.

0.0	0.25052374823	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.524118479032	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.

0.0	0.493181006552	What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy, and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need.
0.0	0.331867266539	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.607200255197	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.

0.0	0.21007935665	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.479453974145	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.292323519038	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.423293844119	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.57225225439	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
0.0	0.207876190758	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.461878461539	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.246017931664	Now, what does that mean?
0.0	0.287204379675	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.149562274538	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.57559703584	We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital.

0.0	0.395529877594	Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS.
1.0	0.618843054208	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.281720180282	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.

0.0	0.243160575021	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.445079095069	They make a billion dollars a day.
0.0	0.416001519649	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
0.0	0.0982621789059	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
0.0	0.131243494755	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.0888185585751	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.62956689007	And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.357674881182	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.

0.0	0.321937841546	Meanwhile, the rich get richer.
0.0	0.487882363512	And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.
0.0	0.531701979461	We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.
0.0	0.526163641964	I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support.
1.0	0.531348492099	Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof.
0.0	0.0977840473697	I do respect Rand.
0.0	0.0182675756924	Absolutely.
0.0	0.571451625029	Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
0.0	0.19089107193	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.359775159196	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
1.0	0.237059977505	They're bringing crime.
0.0	0.1924663783	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
1.0	0.967693648735	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
0.0	0.0265187841139	On welfare.
0.0	0.578399560865	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.251365590832	Of course not.
0.0	0.255140860281	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.251960060922	But it will be...
0.0	0.452703938338	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.362852770587	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
0.0	0.114277891288	Looking forward to it.
0.0	0.0373265012688	I have no idea.

0.0	0.525520685243	The business model of Wall Street is fraud.
0.0	0.332347572118	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.403247408342	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.419233827946	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.289596791663	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.611652904083	We have one House member from Vermont, three candidates in the race.
0.0	0.229437188299	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.

0.0	0.289892201803	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.241228402714	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.0506206793269	They're a scam.
1.0	0.611614612016	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.358160450368	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.578186174712	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.904066851883	What should we do?
0.0	0.0289989176075	It's not responsible.

0.0	0.153371675763	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.229507126262	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.508297924248	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.251008822573	It is going to be amazingly destructive.
0.0	0.558240246713	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.191659829999	Their family is waiting for them.

0.0	0.180944106955	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.387257812741	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.628787136948	The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.
0.0	0.478460198724	Why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want?
0.0	0.352969961443	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.269204808445	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
0.0	0.255151667116	Give Bernie Sanders credit.

0.0	0.0610264054973	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.127692769146	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.249529968799	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.21038383423	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.520846647311	We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground.
0.0	0.0813953776923	Again, Americans murdered.
0.0	0.255444236824	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.468312524316	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.358038545818	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.106714371459	We can't do it.
0.0	0.344310056535	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.0424704892701	And you know what?
0.0	0.549565508021	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.440852728163	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.434081006867	Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.
0.0	0.580646994285	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.0183224443913	OK?
0.0	0.0215525215688	And I apologize to nobody for that.
0.0	0.492367844557	In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America.
0.0	0.469326261281	In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, "what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"
0.0	0.5	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
0.0	0.446495899307	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.290589686537	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.540452279897	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.357231060681	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.219518220875	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.516925831362	So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act.
0.0	0.332866247866	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.35785959119	Our country doesn't win anymore.
1.0	0.935241842932	I lost that election by three percentage points.
0.0	0.568229079129	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.207340371102	He couldn't answer the question.
0.0	0.565841190993	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.347403721601	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.0278957548388	We have losers.
0.0	0.307582119107	KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.
0.0	0.358131793326	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.273774716115	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.253039903929	She's the senator from New York.
0.0	0.0452742191928	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.440264131002	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.144334307214	So they put together this.
0.0	0.450175509841	I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.
0.0	0.310753658231	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.445081533494	There has never been a jihadist group like this.
0.0	0.46958952199	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.305260409231	Because I've seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime.
0.0	0.0924479483948	... Chris, your questions that you...
0.0	0.388338182637	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.271240365331	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.241882169341	Mark my words.
0.0	0.303424846332	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.566884419081	It's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement.
0.0	0.0665924488656	If I was president, I'd say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.252429863044	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.483329388541	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.563391543943	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.076477860263	...before I go.
0.0	0.269605108404	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.489838153428	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.344407142241	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.309550166093	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.414287598408	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.576790610105	The United States must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.385828714979	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.553625022188	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.559150176391	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.395895990229	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.267095503143	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.57042184537	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.491938812657	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.206182709058	They would have to pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.219969046721	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.46730575017	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.203454364926	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.0958505967162	Jared (ph), Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family.
0.0	0.411899091774	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.0424704892701	And you know what?
0.0	0.330748039388	You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.
0.0	0.354164006716	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.481579444562	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.336025156375	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.152867191673	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.410044776482	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.346736507483	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.353872839444	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.323360724089	I don't think the term is what's important.
0.0	0.538730493594	I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.
0.0	0.534294187536	By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started.
0.0	0.5	There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction.
0.0	0.236068002323	And he asked me to support that.
0.0	0.55770921652	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.485785796444	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.555159096174	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.429485349338	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.462612008244	We're spending $80 billion locking people up, disproportionately Latino and African American.
0.0	0.0424249808496	And there's a lot.
0.0	0.551073271329	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.400466812806	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.423606479003	... family leave for a very long time...
0.0	0.424529918599	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.207416724608	Let me just...
0.0	0.251960060922	I will do that.
0.0	0.364119437663	Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.
0.0	0.331109627194	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.564246386946	That is why I support a $12 national federal minimum wage.
0.0	0.0668127292915	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.56369453143	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
0.0	0.438042543857	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.568596809879	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.581299081949	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.265646754844	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.
0.0	0.509019948198	And the U.S. chamber of commerce, which hardly ever says nice things about Democratic governors anywhere, named our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship.
0.0	0.53329440878	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.434499900736	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.0424704892701	And you know what?
0.0	0.490198994851	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.507367417327	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.487895736553	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.12752911595	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.45789249345	This is what's made our nation so special.
0.0	0.535811318244	Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978.
0.0	0.165501545637	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.11769986158	And I watch the speeches.
0.0	0.561309549113	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.591699297431	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.

0.0	0.532357022247	My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, which sparked my interest in the need for immigration reform because I know what it's like to be the son of an immigrant.
0.0	0.392629117158	If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.

1.0	0.387665113016	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.449804722911	Well, we're going to have to redo the way the prescription drug industry does business.
0.0	0.476226949246	You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?

1.0	0.648885111912	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.141664686633	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.249166159677	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.

0.0	0.349535061612	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.526260938109	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.152442105294	And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president.
0.0	0.560008157745	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.

0.0	0.458532047908	May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care?
1.0	0.827830821758	Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.

0.0	0.48593849978	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.155685546567	How the hell can you vote for this guy?
0.0	0.296000642809	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.490857697702	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.383055545256	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.533076131211	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.506759542515	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.621465216806	And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.
0.0	0.0503239803291	I'm the only person...

0.0	0.156433457768	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.15403215245	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.297180761739	That will be my mission as president.

0.0	0.0101317532154	So, I thank you very much for that.
0.0	0.0332592896233	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.50984628623	It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.

0.0	0.188952636949	Let me give you the bad news.
0.0	0.356906167129	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.180572129744	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.246506374359	I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.
0.0	0.436071810706	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.5	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.376512591313	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.411232017753	I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history.
0.0	0.576204091768	And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
0.0	0.435337597437	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.290077264429	But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college.
0.0	0.453630864047	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.
0.0	0.396716366589	I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.
0.0	0.0965626898873	... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.
1.0	0.875315065716	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.383564635909	And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.322081190084	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.473227964843	So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating, but the highest median income in America.
0.0	0.0907007724475	The Obama administration.
0.0	0.55424747515	Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country.
0.0	0.213287199115	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.
0.0	0.506750623714	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.330160169192	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.448192671775	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.118200394046	It is enormously complicated.
0.0	0.13825138454	That's what we need.
0.0	0.245981476454	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.0603978203242	Yes, I'm getting...
0.0	0.566404397982	He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration.
0.0	0.527451582791	We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president.
0.0	0.5	And when he moved on his own people, threatening a massacre, genocide, the Europeans and the Arabs, our allies and partners, did ask for American help and we provided it.
0.0	0.0821292727344	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
0.0	0.5	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.253243477965	I will be ready.
0.0	0.44089799947	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.138203983003	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.370506409784	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.
0.0	0.525987830453	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
1.0	0.161075462905	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.126359607749	That's right.
0.0	0.310882410138	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.231288298392	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.492119975004	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.272583809304	Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done.
0.0	0.359266054986	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.308675541979	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.126112612044	That's not right.
0.0	0.382229784688	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.248639605375	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.358298612756	My background is different.
0.0	0.0424034417377	He's wrong.
0.0	0.406598150935	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.209698794527	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.43398449641	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.347144344491	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.273102264154	Kathie, this was not merely theory in Maryland.
0.0	0.404327422885	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.557260892889	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.36528049692	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.371904840412	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
1.0	0.941052394517	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
0.0	0.467148820017	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.333250806528	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.391660257113	But at the end of the day, no doubt, the Affordable Care Act is a step forward.
0.0	0.424960254685	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.61009796874	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.178635516911	Washington is broken.
0.0	0.0488045667908	That's all I'm saying.

0.0	0.017721480818	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.525145621293	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.161891862002	They don't have a clue.
0.0	0.535160862424	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.537492168472	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.167396276347	And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.
0.0	0.0177396587326	I agree with that.
0.0	0.13204887382	But you know what we did in Maryland?
0.0	0.402173243871	I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena.
0.0	0.0500811301563	(inaudible).

0.0	0.223373435986	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.355783917436	And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives.
0.0	0.0424704892701	So you know what?
0.0	0.643710118894	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
0.0	0.399792986395	I released 34 years of tax returns...
0.0	0.474219908608	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
0.0	0.23086424749	Media notwithstanding.
0.0	0.123270351675	We're laughed at all over the world.
