0.0	0.334427749058	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.0639607855408	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.0789078574264	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.279793176346	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.0565213998558	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.143385215136	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
1.0	0.311333213454	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.164189561154	I think we all support it.
0.0	0.432771977142	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.229188471128	I do.
0.0	0.129900835512	There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out.
0.0	0.195435598022	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.
0.0	0.402375430863	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.116506547691	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.460473123267	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.226495285939	We've got to build a coalition abroad.
0.0	0.357165992046	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
0.0	0.256242181559	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.156472282344	He was on the board.
0.0	0.20693700818	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.0635649148471	DICKERSON: A question from Kathie Obradovich.
0.0	0.171582049517	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.140707164935	... against Islam -- radical Islam -- if you're not for border security.
0.0	0.118550623772	We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation.
0.0	0.590431158189	The simple fact is, we all have a record.
0.0	0.282934157395	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.
0.0	0.214578283945	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.
0.0	0.0629861404088	I know how hard it is to build coalitions.
0.0	0.187471471767	Here's my promise-- Wall Street representatives will not be in my cabinet.
0.0	0.237064625899	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.466733578024	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.0221769073467	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.480477102962	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
1.0	0.967445076477	They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
0.0	0.157347380694	We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels.
0.0	0.283879661869	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.0712391800433	Marco can change his mind.
1.0	0.960112766057	Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.
0.0	0.0311845793799	That's not right.
0.0	0.062030766288	But Obamacare kicks in in 2016.
0.0	0.695486305137	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.0085134913555	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.440942158406	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.0666710914706	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.042583588754	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.177861376734	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.18553646365	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.310880921207	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.287460492492	They would never be hired again.
0.0	0.440049295082	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.792471825689	And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to.
0.0	0.0249708569	You're certainly not very good.
0.0	0.568929864135	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.100342831517	And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous.
0.0	0.394940918597	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.585281694595	And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.
0.0	0.342343934694	And let me, by the way, take this moment to congratulate Hillary Clinton, who I thought not only did an outstanding job as our first lady, but redefined what that role could be.
0.0	0.0977539509118	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.437331452494	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.214896895229	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.0984879187467	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.26331558542	Let's do more -- let's do more than reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.399819937281	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.151601798616	I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
0.0	0.13629286063	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
0.0	0.125915427414	If I was president, I'd say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.352132855098	Given the fact that she's a lot smarter than me, yes, she would.
0.0	0.056240497133	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.0470629032052	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.0985885769432	That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
0.0	0.240554395087	You've got to be on top of it.
0.0	0.380061109601	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.0652358577058	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.191011320916	Ever.
0.0	0.185210681178	Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.
0.0	0.184022053767	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.403026796472	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.158494680238	Yes, exactly, exactly.
0.0	0.349149614806	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.201043026353	So ladies and gentlemen...I am officially running...... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.
0.0	0.0849227010989	Excuse me.
0.0	0.278625856924	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.153864125193	It's not about Donald Trump.
0.0	0.450988542746	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.0626419125484	Jared (ph), Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family.
0.0	0.113459072237	The Turks are being threatened.
0.0	0.151997578257	You do the arithmetic.
1.0	0.12349831799	They're bringing crime.
0.0	0.160582200087	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.416399746003	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
0.0	0.215101930587	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.0398717928423	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.0567365261248	Here's what I believe.
0.0	0.210498928456	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.0787345036655	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.0114534634084	He does great.
0.0	0.187843460387	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
0.0	0.914340797619	It costs me $3.
0.0	0.508267596488	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.776696018356	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.473424933427	And together we make it possible for a new generation of young people to refinance their debt and not come out with debt in the future.
0.0	0.29820478803	When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war.
0.0	0.158457324392	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.395431993601	Clearly the best piece of veterans' legislation brought forth in decades.
0.0	0.377509035839	They're not supporting our law enforcement officers, it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.317985149915	As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.
0.0	0.0897851933106	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.019263191174	I really am.
0.0	0.229188471128	Why?
0.0	0.3946456617	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.128415000464	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.221713521215	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.353579898843	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.428067340433	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.46283011829	This is what's made our nation so special.
0.0	0.135898790267	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.590163492905	He's actually a negative force.
0.0	0.365933404844	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.612808170285	We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001.
0.0	0.540754535979	But, bottom line is this is the year 2015.
0.0	0.0690414653122	It's not a bestseller.
0.0	0.322823108982	Check it out.
0.0	0.718130844003	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
0.0	0.0465785760239	I have formed them.
0.0	0.312527624142	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.268281813022	So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.
0.0	0.13585529674	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.209002230468	Because we need money.
0.0	0.0663848756495	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.139151384753	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.024794273851	We're dying.
0.0	0.162737846928	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.181081705342	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
1.0	0.69989274549	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.264950093493	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.293183541105	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.355908652485	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.148830487689	The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.
1.0	0.27074172476	When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.346680504537	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.406029287521	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
1.0	0.984827150628	And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.
0.0	0.23946668678	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.0202301202917	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.105937263946	But I'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya, you would be looking at Syria.
0.0	0.352117499011	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.608546490229	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.157988272358	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.18086611387	We need sound money.
0.0	0.107425874625	You have a bigger problem with China.

0.0	0.291087878801	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
0.0	0.302798836302	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.354839875156	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.5	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.110982156914	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.648488381001	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
0.0	0.046755423875	I will work my heart out.
0.0	0.108084750356	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.444929847784	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.0362778388274	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.259299461807	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.0964572125684	You have a problem with ISIS.
0.0	0.330429748781	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.27373642717	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.121216803631	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.0391442005694	Let's have a Democratic Syria.
0.0	0.038802466363	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.362335250171	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
1.0	0.742012660513	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.880987018552	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.102740876396	You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well.
0.0	0.0526840101195	I think any parent would be so proud of them.
0.0	0.13072937153	They are not our friend, believe me.
0.0	0.40712792947	Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.
1.0	0.579546743923	And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
0.0	0.0160156509856	We're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.262827581454	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.401971127811	I was for legalization.
0.0	0.0883623329023	That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.
0.0	0.187524145018	And here's the problem in this country right now.
0.0	0.0954763339563	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.0584481467507	Now, this is getting to be fun.
0.0	0.046579908582	You just want to...
0.0	0.0873187676906	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.
0.0	0.10159607254	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.393076919832	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.11954075938	They were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.337670038712	And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.
0.0	0.164189561154	I think we all support that.
0.0	0.599699547236	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.122303503754	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.

0.0	0.351944557915	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.391759592722	Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone.
0.0	0.249145031297	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.
0.0	0.373279747104	I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.

0.0	0.146294666914	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.222421003524	We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.
0.0	0.200212447146	Yes.

0.0	0.119930487122	It's not just Wall Street.
0.0	0.298263933395	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.355237547563	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
1.0	0.999999999361	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.

0.0	0.120407704477	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.355553032041	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.462793067165	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.0358979730863	That's what should be done.

0.0	0.246634167079	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.697987427275	Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.
0.0	0.0932202851159	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.163466060043	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.0515932729125	I do not think it would come to that.
0.0	0.543936987966	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.

0.0	0.478485393793	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.363831611337	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.289716583425	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.384949899951	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
0.0	0.147737256901	Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home.
0.0	0.0790411197816	But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up.
0.0	0.102114609503	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.

0.0	0.424512292626	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.841616433273	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.118191208673	If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country.

0.0	0.0263219499566	I don't care.
0.0	0.485855931053	I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here.
0.0	0.369064185079	The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans.

0.0	0.185459523653	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.204488952875	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.399318180369	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.229188471128	How do we do it?"
0.0	0.438825826168	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.562858980472	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.0181409828795	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.575258980789	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.

0.0	0.074241916513	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.323300937686	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.299385234348	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.

0.0	0.206881763609	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.230658847324	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.

0.0	0.135692671957	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.301110186488	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.

0.0	0.312938775463	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.629394903735	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.209375176916	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.188797354924	But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says.
1.0	0.891669693418	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.452465992404	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.413935940966	I am on the committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.253251500767	It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.
0.0	0.492898003852	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.12579696946	She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship.
0.0	0.0592174271725	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.189831424564	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.906931068612	We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally.
0.0	0.363166137637	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.5	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.0831339587894	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.131241589289	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.355174899486	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.29381813354	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.133528576824	Everybody thought the deal was dead.
0.0	0.235437421433	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.163971041068	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.270864892285	And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
0.0	0.345277773797	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.392176330091	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.426237159141	It's a divided country on guns.
0.0	0.821138365015	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.786328288207	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.408016153485	The Libyans turned out for one of the most successful, fairest elections that any Arab country has had.
0.0	0.400095057874	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.203755190532	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.0243239216826	I don't want it."
0.0	0.0436268724632	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.159560089025	Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.018187097536	He's very smooth.
0.0	0.259318345122	That is abundantly clear.
0.0	0.456907117529	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.18863283348	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.152388120661	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.135295779233	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.406261980863	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.398144053999	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.276270210799	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.371952458871	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.968017592603	We defended the highest median income in the country.
0.0	0.63470609574	And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.
0.0	0.226637681796	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.170559343278	Martha -- I would just repeat that --
0.0	0.115032734727	We need new leadership.
0.0	0.283010189936	I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to -- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.
0.0	0.239941829544	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.0339301200336	It is a step forward.
0.0	0.229188471128	No their not.
0.0	0.172478356058	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.152346443583	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.247353240302	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.248694039096	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.150544761192	Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day.
0.0	0.358660900527	Every (inaudible) Democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rosa DeLauro, got ears (ph) to legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave.
0.0	0.357151106357	He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter.
0.0	0.313849142109	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.149024560728	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.453530971348	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.306065629395	There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.
0.0	0.471092811272	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.361521188615	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.

0.0	0.105804795689	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.0236597241434	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.175370508146	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.304400654981	The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...
0.0	0.543101323167	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.290936160134	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.208793701659	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.105710161037	I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.
1.0	0.874443157995	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.

0.0	0.34106010366	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.183488799926	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.221548419573	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.517104960537	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.

0.0	0.0876873348024	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.
0.0	0.0813334999717	And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
0.0	0.532447417401	As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country.
0.0	0.195209809528	Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond...
0.0	0.171926270549	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.0904045394585	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.131460079738	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.379462457917	But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it.
0.0	0.337047482263	Chris I was mentioned in that question.

0.0	0.225959594656	Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting...
0.0	0.284866626661	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.202580719732	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.

0.0	0.156881693617	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.260088012501	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.

0.0	0.348144093721	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.13923687328	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.15758725829	Oh, yes there is.
0.0	0.856383809195	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.198395801858	Planned Parenthood will be defunded.
0.0	0.293112375221	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.295606570619	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.0922025181379	We were wrong.
0.0	0.780992038236	I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.160122761995	Yes, they control them.
0.0	0.955085841167	You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent.
0.0	0.289261920837	And when he moved on his own people, threatening a massacre, genocide, the Europeans and the Arabs, our allies and partners, did ask for American help and we provided it.
0.0	0.489085635829	More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows.
0.0	0.171926027817	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.308629900724	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.714706510319	They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?
0.0	0.0825075132872	Let me...
0.0	0.213776714687	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.211228524907	This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.288784340048	In all due respect...
0.0	0.736351691406	But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
0.0	0.229595731492	But actually I am.
0.0	0.0575830412321	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
1.0	0.943053542842	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.03375943402	Divide that out.
0.0	0.541749001698	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.177875563015	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.885647127003	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.714142543261	The bill would involve legalization.
0.0	0.237745983335	Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.
0.0	0.0905261164832	So it was not against ISIS, it was against -- it was against Assad.
0.0	0.848792359288	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.10718627136	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.283407073031	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.486294837766	They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.
0.0	0.570748899242	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.348361905726	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.0486332877507	So I don't think...
0.0	0.305015861251	First priority, destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.245435548935	I'll advertise my Web site as well.
0.0	0.348726226907	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.166199205946	Please become part of the political revolution.
0.0	0.237269382032	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.818678974716	So it's unfair to say in total...
0.0	0.0311135380541	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.0276118484273	And I hear their speeches.
0.0	0.203542550196	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.0655021455559	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.0732519793647	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.284848558175	You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?
0.0	0.0311845793799	That's right.
0.0	0.363626438365	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.154366873312	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.301264981476	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.144350096448	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.372771332356	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.255945340137	... and I think -- you know, Governor -- Jeb, you -- the attack that -- the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS.
0.0	0.0947219218214	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
0.0	0.604989838797	Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.
0.0	0.418274733897	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.132335668692	Great state, great people.
0.0	0.431307283659	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.154553131542	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.284652586764	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.138867596666	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.202849710841	You learn to create a security cabinet.
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.106015916248	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.556713953012	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.186329478325	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.
0.0	0.6000264412	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.919658519314	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.0261349175572	He was a great negotiator.
0.0	0.738940044198	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.102117015114	Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.
0.0	0.144134493043	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.185945814158	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.337695823461	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.464389234994	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.0149192105141	OK?
0.0	0.357228941756	Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come...
0.0	0.617671498734	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.064310632734	We have no borders.
0.0	0.51014858963	We should make women third-class citizens, that we should allow children to be sexually assaulted, that they are a danger to modern society.
0.0	0.131290081122	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.162276876856	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.0734457163961	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.294636108088	Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid.
0.0	0.066213688475	We need a collaborative approach.
0.0	0.109822923738	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
0.0	0.439444980549	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.354042528363	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.932189856048	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.596766651165	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.53499496486	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
0.0	0.196757562806	You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.
0.0	0.105363846203	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.
0.0	0.111665789875	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.0618546526783	I'm going to tell you -- thank you.
0.0	0.422332243927	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.563133326305	That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.205288524004	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.449886343397	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.0920843272204	He believes everything he stands for.
0.0	0.342965853062	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.107985774488	They wouldn't be there except for us.
0.0	0.340327572366	Our vets have been abandoned.
0.0	0.22298762004	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.0740863894134	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.0906219421442	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.201123063041	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.127174566861	Somebody said, "Oh, that's crass."
0.0	0.714934187474	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.454780659794	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.186816390846	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.111006082384	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.140576462033	I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.
0.0	0.156447695171	In this building, in Trump Tower.
0.0	0.115060797051	We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States.
0.0	0.20698434134	Making fun of disabled people...
0.0	0.0167534638447	Yeah.
0.0	0.494301874013	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.231885815472	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.0984868998513	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.618044118852	We haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.
0.0	0.168227644068	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.116956577869	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.145711093652	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.
0.0	0.0166151580156	Everybody should.
0.0	0.169604820091	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.615764153962	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.110468049527	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.434235657723	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.193739471712	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.340227374071	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.17454983882	It was terrible.
0.0	0.697546481774	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.124272355437	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.0195618499679	I think that is...
0.0	0.160400875801	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.0818346031737	We know about the Brits.
0.0	0.0787080133726	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.206967118319	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.149377911378	I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.174299438419	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.229188471128	We do.
0.0	0.236592624711	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.142010516753	But people have to be alert.
0.0	0.401695589307	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.232763790301	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.0637294198069	That's off the table...
0.0	0.816335589995	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.392605435431	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.399147315274	White people?
0.0	0.131056032641	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.947577951999	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.10248213848	Here's what I'd do.
0.0	0.479045202151	We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.223060757977	We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.
0.0	0.189549510081	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.110182854999	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.0354177819979	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.317115910009	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.098298440299	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.425914611848	There's no nation on earth that comes close to that number.
0.0	0.320712133934	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.138724982351	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.307582106237	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.240539367539	The Iranians getting more of a presence in Syria, linking with Hezbollah, their proxy in Lebanon, would threaten Israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with Assad's future.
0.0	0.0944364144399	That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.
0.0	0.18979950805	You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.
0.0	0.100902634389	Find out what I said to Greenspan.
0.0	0.320152422815	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.427980466235	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.118410211049	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.177375918054	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.188647385525	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.117532168965	That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities.
0.0	0.229188471128	I have.
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.134196714667	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.35382758019	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.244503289167	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.0686314427172	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.129970602774	And as our party's nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.841379442017	Thousands.
0.0	0.445688086513	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
1.0	0.896649281234	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.0472188038911	I need your help.
0.0	0.559284855471	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.047140111514	Let's keep going.
0.0	0.454427966761	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.205165447142	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.223310242965	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.0683527652975	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.0195618499679	Think of it.
0.0	0.352117499011	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.455208330759	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.0145851627513	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.60577686553	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.737587014036	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.519230321199	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.0538100595704	I know the good ones.
0.0	0.0876515459995	Hillary doesn't want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her.
0.0	0.278511343432	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.220658136041	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.147824554194	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.0226023670033	And here's what's going to happen.
0.0	0.0360682482994	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.223875725132	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.206900588287	That's the difference, and that's the kind of leader we need in the White House.
0.0	0.388311787235	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.343362594106	Quite likely, for that reason.
0.0	0.100455947532	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.229188471128	It was against Assad.
0.0	0.105341490528	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
0.0	0.0186310841917	We can do that.
0.0	0.308320667958	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.0889408994174	You have to lead.
0.0	0.76418571275	Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally.
0.0	0.635811284877	I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.
0.0	0.514011556184	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
0.0	0.330007446077	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.300090413484	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.023812142297	You're right about that.
0.0	0.375136046158	Number two, we had a really good plan.
0.0	0.55632478078	And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.
0.0	0.300409723255	But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.
0.0	0.353175293176	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.152342372728	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.704014251117	I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons.
0.0	0.225573084727	You're seeing cities like San Francisco, cities like Los Angeles doing it, and they are doing it well and workers are able to have more disposable income.
0.0	0.0222217582041	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.118709503398	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.17211435809	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.639306971701	Of course.
0.0	0.284930273477	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.651460185744	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.283172045717	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.165891509691	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.
0.0	0.206088715899	That's true.
0.0	0.157627540729	That's fine.
0.0	0.387916114427	But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn't cut and run.
0.0	0.130847524645	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.925892604297	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.175734083387	... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street.
0.0	0.207356328732	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.201970877295	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.19705801687	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.247021055591	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.417996676204	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.19328923759	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.602670123476	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.461768542919	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.200212447146	Yes.
0.0	0.191242552082	I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.
0.0	0.177923582144	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.
0.0	0.277181936953	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.0947498644362	But not for us.
0.0	0.292235068568	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.199743726235	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.55987686207	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.429151076932	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
0.0	0.426974447482	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.08646237247	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.216402163307	Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.
0.0	0.221771462613	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.183465912806	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.174672561294	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.0432608768802	So you might not.
0.0	0.861235837516	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
1.0	0.999985443761	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.31515728803	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.118576193065	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.126182207766	Wall Street today has too much political power.
0.0	0.374588138918	But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.
0.0	0.405200574052	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.285521795057	This group needs to be confronted and defeated.
0.0	0.302071639132	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.114011995562	We have losers.
0.0	0.36758944122	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.123989847718	And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave.
0.0	0.280924302999	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.169868033831	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.188401411813	But it's a lot safer.
0.0	0.0543478266345	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.743011365681	And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.
0.0	0.342299349008	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.238537644366	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.288452521037	I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures.
0.0	0.516400869159	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.34138467638	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...
0.0	0.255455071669	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.0311845793799	All right.
0.0	0.25720983362	... do I go -- let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.680397703107	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
1.0	0.786618987605	Nancy, the blueprint in Maryland that we followed was yes, we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment.
0.0	0.173729627538	You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.
0.0	0.55196954197	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
1.0	0.866140486368	$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work.
0.0	0.0576946888501	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.270142497557	What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS.
0.0	0.51229232578	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.281023465578	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.327410860671	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.3205237459	Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.
0.0	0.24036895619	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.113979280843	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.340702625565	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.124677779489	And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition, including Russia, to help us destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.216087258394	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.0456180439016	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.830018977317	And universities.
1.0	0.661596080081	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.559780081597	In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, "what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"
0.0	0.219658035207	Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.
0.0	0.0410125125709	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.431534442147	First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, "they cannot have it all."
0.0	0.396210190615	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.323234032768	Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe.
0.0	0.0513960103825	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
1.0	0.959084792879	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.389717482164	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.0173172743647	No vision at all.
0.0	0.0226979830811	I won't be doing that.
0.0	0.0754115950603	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.608610232862	When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
0.0	0.161337250529	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.
0.0	0.537785881271	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.408560771891	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.30480587276	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.0107425062355	No, I love them.
0.0	0.336338098277	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.10868151304	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.10457473475	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.689915549408	To tell Qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep.
0.0	0.664586956047	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.
0.0	0.106344034384	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.465737139046	It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested.
0.0	0.176655958457	What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger.
0.0	0.160674452164	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.311760842147	Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.
0.0	0.00856646305773	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.169432691935	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.247162272606	And I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well.
0.0	0.625239121838	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.361681771951	And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.220972831744	So the reporter said to me the other day, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person.
0.0	0.423285507344	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.060485530336	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.403219210319	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.049980903614	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.55902336661	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.183599014934	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.0348878922125	That's good.
0.0	0.148486231927	And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.
0.0	0.494571406311	We can end welfare for those here illegally.
0.0	0.113781194418	I don't think we're at war with all Muslims.
0.0	0.314225420823	Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
0.0	0.0725623684116	I have no idea.
0.0	0.274092194239	I am advocating...
0.0	0.352177860106	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.271498873547	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.133398896404	Just get me a job.
0.0	0.179170464343	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
0.0	0.229188471128	I was not at all.
0.0	0.594837434277	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.17364748846	And there is a lot we can do in college affordability.
0.0	0.163882461002	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
1.0	0.92074628494	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.0177685055495	That's what we need.
0.0	0.117981507419	But I would say this to you, Bret.
0.0	0.530067222413	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
0.0	0.13999146708	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.322970512737	(APPLAUSE) They're trying to prevent people from registering to vote.
0.0	0.408265682826	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.104419991852	I waited and I got the scars to show for it.
0.0	0.137244661971	She did it for convenience.
0.0	0.161814540636	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.178078521805	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.229188471128	What do we do?
0.0	0.065176427248	And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.
0.0	0.233901057177	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.0556923250334	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.252274830378	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.193679383073	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.697037119479	The number of women --
0.0	0.537588999966	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.467488703932	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.271763998123	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.227892558617	We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it.
0.0	0.0618374770975	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.0431779012075	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.203905631307	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.0887099866086	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.316226936024	That is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.
0.0	0.379876053313	Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them.
0.0	0.138644626913	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.
0.0	0.774073965104	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.335231587067	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.977676172847	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.597256818123	Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers.
0.0	0.146744386506	We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
0.0	0.454402092935	The United States must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.119324025898	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.479981967427	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.483243553085	In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.
0.0	0.424141431352	I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.
0.0	0.362915232022	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.713600463602	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.00300288174206	But look...
0.0	0.134438547709	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.23775280108	We have a lot of work to do, to better prepare our nation and to better lead this world into this new century.
0.0	0.0851572729386	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.0868422607109	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.731732509385	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.284150477349	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
1.0	0.80757051721	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.227592627347	You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
0.0	0.339277300231	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.165812323205	And that's what we have= representing us.
0.0	0.181389115344	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.406719339253	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.313327092177	There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan.

0.0	0.0743116177095	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.320998764525	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.152119834309	All the time.
0.0	0.853651375528	Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.
0.0	0.119679669579	Now the Libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge ISIS from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.
0.0	0.287192792088	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
1.0	0.983717725356	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.420497128448	And, yes, we are at war with those people.
0.0	0.177034985779	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.524790658724	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.610475068829	We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York.
0.0	0.210570056531	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.255456601133	It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.
0.0	0.346975125416	Make ourselves stronger at home, but also our role in the world, yes, is also to confront evil when it rises.
0.0	0.262541105981	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.112317895223	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.639306971701	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.166036199353	Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face.
0.0	0.19943989066	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.
0.0	0.116258428094	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.074371209354	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.258361094496	There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
0.0	0.210369253468	And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.
0.0	0.297894244385	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.0524735792205	Thank you Chris...
0.0	0.033150461352	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.449804479201	But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.
0.0	0.639024661764	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.525003393933	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.295031498219	The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.
0.0	0.168201823715	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.631000001647	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.306615134297	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.473522991821	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.212148153554	I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.
0.0	0.0423506461202	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.271957442867	We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...
0.0	0.283180040997	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
0.0	0.138168393748	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.310598071518	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy.
1.0	0.995905608081	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.390783737917	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.1331107518	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.0311845793799	That's not right.
0.0	0.0163036193656	We're friends.
0.0	0.318595743648	And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young, old, everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard.
0.0	0.136751532172	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
1.0	0.978706965027	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
0.0	0.0192736759828	You know, I like Marco.
0.0	0.156753331023	The Obama administration.
0.0	0.201508548	As president, I would make the administrator of USAID an actual cabinet member.
0.0	0.37893090708	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.611430329999	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.168488827242	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.291183346102	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.
0.0	0.280099023876	We have people that aren't working.
0.0	0.322271383911	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.470210957593	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.11250389229	I would prioritize them.
0.0	0.0656297285725	I have a problem with that, Martha.
0.0	0.0939414788769	And Teddy Roosevelt is right.
0.0	0.532268185323	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.156394885497	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
1.0	0.415956897396	Well, we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists.
0.0	0.443889716374	The young officer who was killed responding to the Planned Parenthood murders.
1.0	0.594409764659	I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer.
0.0	0.103700529435	Becky --
0.0	0.0930436995294	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.0520601719171	And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.
0.0	0.253216022539	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.
0.0	0.9206508773	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.186054037152	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
0.0	0.127502677227	We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.
0.0	0.167322309894	And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world.
0.0	0.873719481109	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.283110359881	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.36970048783	And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go.
0.0	0.273382078603	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.140200944047	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.635373942289	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.229188471128	...
0.0	0.207725743295	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.29990396506	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.463890228395	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.305172229713	He's weak on immigration.
0.0	0.315599258467	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.409620884475	You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon.
0.0	0.0917698829356	They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.
0.0	0.170926391378	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.290428103018	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.260191941808	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.0195843957733	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.659533705586	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.584725949337	We have three children, eight, five and one.
0.0	0.514231047391	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.323523040833	We now have that.
0.0	0.529904642676	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.328310668504	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.116804662147	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.104432481661	They will never make America great again.
0.0	0.0926097349871	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.
0.0	0.206070061653	I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?
0.0	0.160841045934	Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months.
0.0	0.193528295216	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.221189099287	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.425857890432	Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
0.0	0.639306971701	Of course, you would.
0.0	0.0684571819649	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.0880848606353	Judgment matters as well.
1.0	0.991090086978	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.19803532044	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
0.0	0.109754249857	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.0980455401601	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.0975643750967	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.321003469218	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.0167534638447	Yeah.
0.0	0.192863273063	They're a scam.
0.0	0.27537142167	All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee.
0.0	0.115183100919	Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire.
0.0	0.0612526636815	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.357055397182	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.624653482557	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.275099217429	And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent.
0.0	0.44748693923	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.229188471128	These...
0.0	0.400957793799	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.451150797036	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.0977488247621	There's been no crowd like this.
0.0	0.0324079776204	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.0151496663691	Okay.
0.0	0.0891976931365	Really big league.
0.0	0.0149192105141	OK?
0.0	0.147207873398	That's not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.
0.0	0.156561881863	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.450234076707	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.151154720642	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.422284511954	Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
0.0	0.410344871952	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.322823108982	Check it out.
0.0	0.0354828578608	We will do very, very well, very, very well.
0.0	0.056498495352	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.240080291385	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.46651020287	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.304633086735	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.143251234958	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.00768719491491	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.306599726022	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.845958566483	But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.
0.0	0.21670948232	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.0910547599386	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.128287833239	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.212277412852	If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.
0.0	0.100378620328	I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary...
0.0	0.0783238200974	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.327858436123	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.265706137153	ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.
0.0	0.0486332877507	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.0746663910564	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.17315697304	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.160647984214	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.285665738756	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
1.0	0.991822439839	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.187636887041	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.572189939654	But the United States is not the policeman of the world.
0.0	0.344691504506	I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out.
0.0	0.419967481508	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.167171042417	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
0.0	0.258559164875	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.0318950004691	I think he'd be a great spirit."
0.0	0.289203595022	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.00300288174206	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.218973814802	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.16155358316	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.0282990771451	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.139512648211	And, you know, I do think it's important to do exactly what Senator Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about, and that they talk to each of us about.
0.0	0.458072219253	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.0367989149884	And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.
0.0	0.303958453778	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.0699569868784	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.214813183897	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.060208437328	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.83475403026	Number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own.
0.0	0.200981804668	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.252004235321	But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.
0.0	0.549167129136	Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS.
0.0	0.470835564835	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.0218380430184	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.294567175988	But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.133215466681	I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.
0.0	0.0561864448384	We say "we're gonna protect."
0.0	0.229188471128	Both.
0.0	0.122615727227	I'm meeting with three of them in the next week.
0.0	0.381477957183	But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
0.0	0.0551393251477	When did we beat Japan at anything?
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.310729138519	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
1.0	0.540672427279	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.218178699096	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.130154457029	Now, our country needs -- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
0.0	0.136233437211	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
0.0	0.156291273704	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.432540349403	How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years.
0.0	0.184674904281	I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.
0.0	0.0763216027403	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.476908170128	You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks.
0.0	0.182279083049	You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.
0.0	0.13536946937	We've got to hate the Muslims."
0.0	0.19815908028	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.0534364171546	I love this country.
0.0	0.108326070667	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.227156278695	Two points.
0.0	0.434960747183	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.167191726637	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.181513059643	And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work.
0.0	0.0845819080578	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.0380718210831	They'll all come back.
0.0	0.748364692931	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.225282691425	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.114984572015	I was in Burlington, Iowa.
0.0	0.0487081799318	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.458281065679	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
1.0	0.698908021897	And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent.
0.0	0.273688625917	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.0348878922125	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.113616334236	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.151389173556	... Chris, your questions that you...
0.0	0.199085503762	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.160338364353	Not bad.
0.0	0.0203366177655	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.0457269470209	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.505057118475	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.0394265540644	Neil...
0.0	0.0707461721031	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.0109733418572	What sense is that?
0.0	0.256990523283	You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911.
0.0	0.0743828183927	Well, I'll tell you who is on my side.
0.0	0.371647335065	I've spent my entire life, since I started as a young lawyer for the Children's Defense Fund, trying to figure out how we can even the odds for so many people in America, this great country of ours, who are behind, who don't have a chance.
0.0	0.0823516798757	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.162772471969	And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.
0.0	0.0506958244345	But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.
0.0	0.045848565562	But get this.
0.0	0.288600242824	He said, "Yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.155868189716	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.
0.0	0.0186310841917	I can.
0.0	0.846101859014	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.640805435112	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.0659226036535	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.028384803448	Chris...
0.0	0.0243239216826	I don't want it.
0.0	0.0587881051874	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.24338860149	We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
0.0	0.761272596888	We've enacted it in our state.
0.0	0.171654690726	We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.
0.0	0.245175393411	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.0189089769161	They knew that.
0.0	0.480173471914	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.0909062180729	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.302637623341	Our country is in serious trouble.
0.0	0.358658731424	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.386609758133	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	0.0126539350718	You don't have to.
1.0	0.846650059511	In fact, wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century, after my husband's administration.
0.0	0.805735292343	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.250552309985	Number one, we're going to keep ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.641467710105	Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.
0.0	0.301789647333	You read about all the companies now that are doing business -- about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on.
0.0	0.130024367058	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.233975040946	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.43223610909	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.0594983133219	Our next president...
0.0	0.377638022184	And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.
0.0	0.198910018974	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.212523780977	We now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act, and I don't think we should have to be defending it among Democrats.
0.0	0.422390302758	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.115870977056	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.294058390304	Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people.
0.0	0.172192654033	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
0.0	0.200212447146	Yes.
0.0	0.415092498425	We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.
0.0	0.0221887472636	We have problems with Russia.
0.0	0.120438775467	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
1.0	0.933182717609	And I have assets -- big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected -- 9 billion 240 million dollars.
0.0	0.833690475314	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.355819191392	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.236088366839	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.483277298121	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.238427517187	And one of his little boys said to him, "Dad, what happens if Donald Trump wins and we have to move out of our homes?"
0.0	0.124332326942	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.0493311515526	He didn't know.
0.0	0.309071622894	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.152166646096	Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.
0.0	0.185907973448	You know why three?
0.0	0.0678718894765	He's not arming the Kurds.
0.0	0.138681342688	But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college.
0.0	0.0893619761025	But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting.
0.0	0.515840868778	And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.
0.0	0.247939944966	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.247401712668	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.
1.0	0.999981180088	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.230502986575	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.177008175802	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.192921597526	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.330157768266	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.428571080526	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.104134195843	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.615671989419	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
0.0	0.124518298593	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.172978306317	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.147819717682	One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together.
0.0	0.0596748454452	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.342993029143	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.243975405853	We're up 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.432408820682	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.272680337503	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.546538446186	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.533660527852	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.261116514172	I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.
0.0	0.507120033265	You do legislation.
0.0	0.136628371161	But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate.
0.0	0.288131239202	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.295690223825	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.620570412602	Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.
0.0	0.239740792005	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.123866388839	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.0983587924468	They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America.
0.0	0.0908193563071	I think I am a nice person.
0.0	0.14627410569	But I was born here.
0.0	0.264008803419	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.
0.0	0.154787861817	And Abdullah said something recently, very important.
0.0	0.126545405424	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.520158101123	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.229188471128	...
0.0	0.94951030092	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.221098300498	Everybody's for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.45906302116	I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
0.0	0.237563274378	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.393026239712	The big banks--
0.0	0.5	No, both the federal and a state approach.
1.0	0.999999061909	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.343221733451	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.60817389487	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.0610310928625	I think there is a consensus.
0.0	0.246446962223	How does that help us?  TRUMP R 15 94 1 N Where is that good?
0.0	0.790800720255	By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started.
0.0	0.116842897841	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.0273345820887	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.346951953558	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.0787358346122	I tell you that.
0.0	0.303970845474	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.0575180983958	It really is important that we go forward on this.
0.0	0.526369472566	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.0967636904833	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.19468130918	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.0245449256015	Everybody knows that.
1.0	0.889638664208	They were wrong.
0.0	0.205394836376	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
0.0	0.142456686081	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.0186310841917	You can do both.
0.0	0.0238053980763	This is the election...
0.0	0.0907239458968	I know the overrated ones.
0.0	0.403480244985	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.405949760529	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.0317566975123	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.213444804334	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.211569167887	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.133547828988	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.390129374146	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.0772561225559	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
1.0	0.964438496832	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.0541588390826	Well, thank you.
0.0	0.272909844032	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.316400788149	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.12474514883	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
0.0	0.251148844187	We will -- when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice.
0.0	0.302385952675	Because you realize that people depending on you.
0.0	0.919691219388	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.591948617605	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.631907404445	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.105807623759	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.0851641152988	What a brilliant idea that would be.
0.0	0.0507498088005	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
0.0	0.332286891427	There's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.
0.0	0.206088715899	That's not true.
0.0	0.0723310567278	That will change everything.
0.0	0.0786518223314	We've got nothing.
0.0	0.0219031351309	They can't.
0.0	0.104556088663	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.101759347656	I promise.
0.0	0.421710493465	And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.
0.0	0.26589170563	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.253439827134	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.838584510878	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.0422546349024	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.174541047837	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.171666916842	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
0.0	0.258708867864	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.408980168673	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.131531813601	So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.
0.0	0.13429317337	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.313650309651	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.992449905291	...income tax...
0.0	0.032542388198	So, so important.
0.0	0.494810650683	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.50701327331	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.017759844346	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.621854286264	I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.
0.0	0.187918914466	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.430358328284	They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.
0.0	0.14267633134	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.21937203905	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.0847839706638	That's the job.
0.0	0.206499185595	Al Qaida was based in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.274325523787	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
1.0	0.999992381091	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.0884869259899	... Chris, keep it coming...
0.0	0.0207017269436	And we are not England.
0.0	0.198913324029	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.0881250215339	I've gotta do it."
0.0	0.141081795654	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.248754964173	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.217278067474	I'm asking you for your vote.
1.0	0.182263662453	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.102057701508	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.154261040577	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.1043440895	I'd like to offer a...
0.0	0.279602946387	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.221077307576	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.220148547091	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
1.0	0.947195892611	He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.
0.0	0.233343849151	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.486378113757	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.715479724927	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.264933885671	I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses.
0.0	0.16837797915	You learn to create feedback mechanisms.
0.0	0.165994536253	No, John.
0.0	0.395456241687	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
0.0	0.645350064632	But at the end of the day, what you have right now are millions of Americans working two or three jobs because their wages that they are earning are just too low.
0.0	0.190325574024	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.148932379368	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.198219076445	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.183673738504	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.685487856316	It's their money.
0.0	0.149595781045	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
1.0	0.990880380639	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.402541346337	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.0369308330606	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.420957647336	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.0167534638447	Yeah.
0.0	0.136835751935	And a lot of people are doing that.
0.0	0.123224078246	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.0487607532808	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.229654802442	What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria, when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family you'd better get out now.
0.0	0.232580251101	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.110769335897	Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.
0.0	0.582281014907	Who denies that it is crazy...
1.0	0.996589445301	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.0346122254151	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.0436178459302	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.190807963902	And I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate.
0.0	0.350993304829	Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint.
0.0	0.412927719608	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.144788327225	If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're (inaudible).
0.0	0.229188471128	2,000?
0.0	0.983253212711	Could we loan you $4 billion"?
0.0	0.33069803234	John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL, and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening.
0.0	0.0263219499566	I don't care.
0.0	0.132377862876	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
1.0	0.356386504397	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.157884071365	But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be looking for new sources of energy.
0.0	0.349031916221	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.661105291164	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.122543342956	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.0860120774496	You want one?
0.0	0.403112131352	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.0487384165043	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.55389890401	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.58309907977	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.149681170984	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.309902615744	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.165467690933	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.368523319249	The business model of Wall Street is fraud.
0.0	0.229370550526	But you know what we did in Maryland?
0.0	0.319063636916	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.363854645225	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.174783290656	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.0664963978175	Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done.
0.0	0.0488821286438	They're going to build in Mexico.
0.0	0.270693735822	I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video.
0.0	0.082854644907	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.129805089318	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.194359791311	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.0210236422386	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.102484254023	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.483471444671	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.16829412543	I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third.
0.0	0.809030298675	They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care.
0.0	0.0172109304597	It's nice.
0.0	0.0382374170947	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.0905594091064	They thought something was wrong.
0.0	0.164318441396	I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.
0.0	0.110571813251	How are they going to beat ISIS?
0.0	0.383934603767	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.0860099143728	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.629344524885	So as a nation we need to increase what we invest in Pell grants.
0.0	0.280963425563	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.0352996343933	Chris, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.0678803645116	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.0275224140541	Oh.
1.0	0.99333570656	It didn't say a word about legalization.
0.0	0.520270814207	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.0747111904318	Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.
0.0	0.204593477188	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
0.0	0.270364022014	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.381370553755	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.362392540384	I guess the one I -- I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after Bin Laden.
0.0	0.893230310215	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.35441909149	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.544612023658	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.184008690104	Border security has always been a part of that debate.
0.0	0.0775133275313	I totally get that.
0.0	0.293333535295	Wall Street is a threat to the economy.
0.0	0.18727640089	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.318840797336	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
0.0	0.265905877478	And I will go back and say again, AIG was not a big bank.
0.0	0.210265461804	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.319095648878	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.
0.0	0.1730917678	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.0260139170888	We know about the Belgians.
0.0	0.0598923818022	Might I respond?
0.0	0.284014678039	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
0.0	0.131451146632	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.405892758875	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.283102127032	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.200808145485	Secondly, we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.
1.0	0.5	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.121757512208	So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
0.0	0.636137419158	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.403681103914	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.267877693658	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.0715970951412	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.0196661737233	I like China.
0.0	0.531159952292	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.572455151008	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.374476223969	Go on to my website.
0.0	0.0498233043714	You know, I've always had a great deal of respect.
0.0	0.0137038039099	He's very charming.
0.0	0.476693982916	You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
0.0	0.285801349676	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.0592810700155	Sorry.
0.0	0.33780376063	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.394011228209	So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years -- you know, we're at $8 trillion now.

1.0	0.983425859922	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
0.0	0.276609253284	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.249504340005	Let's put the gun makers and sellers on notice that they're not going to get away with it.
0.0	0.0909070225726	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.366534060246	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.482472585556	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.

0.0	0.246525146667	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
1.0	0.426836285685	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.171957319938	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.016376945495	There is a vacuum.
0.0	0.397902263715	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.281535068751	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.248712657689	We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States.
0.0	0.297276336286	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.346350491502	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.0961279163396	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.0637311882574	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.178546186236	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
0.0	0.0661839541866	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.121523889708	I win.
0.0	0.434996690178	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.357262159738	They've become rich.
0.0	0.197592569204	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.
0.0	0.148674014792	I don't think anyone has a magical solution.
0.0	0.163493010377	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.0429263647247	It is a disaster.
0.0	0.229188471128	That's what he is.
0.0	0.264461717219	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.696335071112	Ford.
0.0	0.267296209869	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.701014158014	Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.
0.0	0.0280820499171	Does my family like me?
1.0	0.988833788439	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
0.0	0.136392982837	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.238068873028	I -- I believe that we should make community college free.
0.0	0.201449709355	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.161703388428	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.0585513812756	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.787139520557	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.

0.0	0.447737669888	Fact check me.
0.0	0.182428725685	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.00532412656033	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.153869811268	Well, this whole issue concerns me.
0.0	0.46050347046	That's a hard road to walk.
0.0	0.248592209105	The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.
0.0	0.132770109503	And they wanted to make sure it got built.
0.0	0.465034459347	And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.
0.0	0.136461316675	But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand.
0.0	0.269948322744	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.200081065577	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.21053815862	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.190080368199	First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.281151904688	She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.0909336301558	So nice, thank you very much.
0.0	0.160626092188	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.125053851704	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.0585150469266	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.399544883925	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.
0.0	0.138040799209	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.246830174932	So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.
0.0	0.185294725725	And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people.
0.0	0.282388722395	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.0147893719756	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.164960391638	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.128375004441	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.188093253976	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.480431972828	The biggest bank in the world is from China.
0.0	0.145562360475	So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
0.0	0.112730257511	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.178551078706	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.15189491072	It's real estate.
0.0	0.602365617085	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.5	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.133766563871	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.39412804408	No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.
0.0	0.225483426251	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.0880122802232	That's not fair.
0.0	0.788182102907	I want this bill to be voted down.
0.0	0.508767500896	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.5	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.
0.0	0.245971895294	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.919605381233	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.416434269962	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.214582959051	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.118460810585	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.123840641251	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.435713967279	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.128546062613	Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid.
0.0	0.584523688336	And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty.
0.0	0.378383279726	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.119713799242	And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.
0.0	0.188896283573	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.216511024786	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.286199997516	Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country.
0.0	0.179990493488	Come on now.
0.0	0.333859493731	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
0.0	0.066426013341	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.12242865054	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.605255484003	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
0.0	0.253487792744	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.199297231545	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.726589793465	Why is it that we are spending per capita far, far more than Canada, which is 100 miles away from my door, that guarantees health care to all people?
0.0	0.0474921570506	No, I think they won't.
0.0	0.176625312355	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.141676406456	I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.
1.0	0.05430984876	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.194754984707	I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible.
0.0	0.272875635499	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.198091012642	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.619203193421	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.209650876503	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.302137670195	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.352206348088	A few days ago a similar incident happened.
0.0	0.264405478776	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.412354101608	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.351667243492	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
1.0	0.98171356854	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.138264482433	Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
0.0	0.0269065017361	(inaudible).
0.0	0.578572832062	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.119135588548	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.0915891941636	But he wasn't a cheerleader.
0.0	0.768127956138	Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.
0.0	0.280900233781	But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.
0.0	0.289645490761	Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks -- between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance.
0.0	0.17431613817	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.137701875359	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.743027369018	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.13688283275	And I -- I thought, if I didn't jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this.
0.0	0.0126539350718	No, you weren't.
0.0	0.166893054357	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.0620387612258	And for good cause.
0.0	0.552018149764	In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America.
0.0	0.391970097077	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.531926993037	And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.115392957122	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.0866226709697	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.886830248092	That is why I support a $12 national federal minimum wage.
0.0	0.111072349708	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.0222744277551	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.0766374664932	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.18179226499	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.179779906943	You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country.
0.0	0.727290179385	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.270734849159	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.159895290854	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.36864548213	And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans.
0.0	0.531201396652	And that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity -- kill people who are unarmed who should not be killed, they must be held accountable.
0.0	0.00877403015949	I will not do that.
0.0	0.0594199126314	... And start taking advice...
0.0	0.428659378439	... people all over this country -- not you, Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other.
0.0	0.212793335855	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.190663883006	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.447537052192	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.039934837581	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.379433512019	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.178351136833	I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.
0.0	0.379245463629	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.0313991637486	And Martha...
0.0	0.0506143595245	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.228072790685	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.48656920362	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.0879182770944	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.471212310431	These are often very long- term kinds of investments that have to be made.
0.0	0.938771385029	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.353379364449	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.219577841133	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.0884466185454	It's a joke.
1.0	0.736818836764	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.204466460964	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.0398690779723	They don't know what they're doing.
1.0	0.213591424354	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.0484064008798	And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.
0.0	0.440942158406	My plan is there.
0.0	0.184246812742	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.12789939385	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.292223781227	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.0797505967092	I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.517273246282	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.176410366637	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.0974018452749	I think we're at war with jihadists who have --
0.0	0.980442846366	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
1.0	0.665031112157	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.970101413834	She voted for it.
0.0	0.427327438152	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.0882952991776	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.229595731492	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.0567365261248	That's what we believe in.
0.0	0.403521956153	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.442627855366	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.0752803895735	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.803898927385	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.568374353231	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.299605068496	You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster.
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.310221011863	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.330539558516	RADDATZ: OK. Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, right here at Saint Anselm college, Neil Levesque.
0.0	0.257805154741	There are many lawyers.

0.0	0.423069152868	I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.

0.0	0.0995153347379	I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.420571223401	And I was determined to do everything that I could to make VA health care the best in the world, to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending.

0.0	0.245331948355	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.

0.0	0.0311845793799	That's right.
0.0	0.388611314144	And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.

0.0	0.200212447146	Yes.
0.0	0.0830928630307	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.129895873516	I said, "how's it going?"
0.0	0.111237938664	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.

0.0	0.218355433157	It cannot be contained, it must be defeated.
0.0	0.408560707147	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.273226203319	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.0310947167843	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.0260139170888	You know why?
0.0	0.447557266378	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.356327301522	You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down.

0.0	0.39669311595	We have people that are morally corrupt.
0.0	0.220739344264	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.5	They don't want to raise the minimum wage, they don't want to do anything to increase incomes.
0.0	0.162027651886	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.0149192105141	OK.
0.0	0.210688873516	It's Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.
0.0	0.0593040771499	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.235851882565	Sit down with people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the house, and work on a bill.
0.0	0.0599838520068	You really can't.
0.0	0.351625751681	I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor, I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very, very powerful and most important of all jobs in the United States, the president, whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country.
0.0	0.0880848606353	But judgment matters as well.
1.0	0.975891214093	What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons.
0.0	0.00156553722196	I'll do it.
0.0	0.30390542464	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.350099345187	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.127702377534	How are these people gonna lead us?
0.0	0.146836873966	If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.
0.0	0.47143913136	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.202842259517	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.163217679718	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.220092273095	That's what I understand is the request from the international...
0.0	0.267863188182	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.209604965923	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.0738322029549	But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.299860488236	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.0692899492795	I don't need the rhetoric.
0.0	0.110236778722	And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce's great story.
0.0	0.0580166919924	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.234748764577	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.0277749418283	Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.
0.0	0.645435492305	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.265174384491	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.229188471128	No.
0.0	0.14549993314	We need to move aggressively now.
0.0	0.111029502715	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.188052345156	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.170875879758	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.34070502056	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.341376677138	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.321299177856	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.634613783031	I also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees.
0.0	0.544562439283	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.183538554402	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.149916328866	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
1.0	0.591421304506	In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.
0.0	0.5	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.0149192105141	OK.
0.0	0.2839587811	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.137829776056	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.577103830708	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.0755525803198	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.186760268137	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.30363421256	We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.
0.0	0.424761855519	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.
0.0	0.0719512781045	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.444337120895	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.307504619796	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
0.0	0.288253876997	I think after 11 hours, that's pretty clear, yes.
0.0	0.219521900592	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.395106971113	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.176299660966	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.296675444552	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.440235038223	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.296797799468	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.0574757644668	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.12703117787	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.923326323012	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.356049375265	Or would you rather take less later on?
1.0	0.840492665856	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.322866582859	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.123664980958	We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.
0.0	0.023812142297	You're right.
0.0	0.233895159065	I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.0371230380624	Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.
0.0	0.52913399223	I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
0.0	0.0567365261248	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.705077098668	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.67614980631	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.147034677117	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.229803037584	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.289069036129	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.620873826785	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.345879346931	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.235095367643	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.404755092604	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.534080842512	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.128748564376	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.074083210988	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.0918787642808	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.357711392117	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.0861165562417	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.201018642916	There are no simple solutions.
0.0	0.148638112423	I gotta build those big buildings.
0.0	0.208183558339	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.264524742255	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.
0.0	0.369784758541	But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.
0.0	0.423785956078	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.237854634328	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.17898311512	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.28353218929	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.323341488689	The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.
0.0	0.152841814055	And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
0.0	0.157456244965	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.237100342004	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.0921059813246	Good at email.
0.0	0.419125565223	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.474207101262	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.188146502525	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.110374387844	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.0325512018874	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.336999821214	But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything.
0.0	0.436776919878	And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't."
0.0	0.363163096388	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.579682694221	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.358308411215	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.
0.0	0.293203468874	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.210446976671	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.271679627392	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.117091332979	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.
0.0	0.157456121134	We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game.
0.0	0.333612341433	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.0752395314458	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.
0.0	0.0596571996859	Does anyone know this?"
0.0	0.409827067743	It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.
0.0	0.20945537545	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.113114884435	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.0888994495767	That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.
0.0	0.330657877242	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...

0.0	0.181307699744	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.
0.0	0.124514799303	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.

0.0	0.0582337131412	Wall Street is doing great.

0.0	0.17886884976	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.354061957739	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.
0.0	0.229188471128	No.
0.0	0.0695272320336	That's what the political revolution is about.

0.0	0.514513988324	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.778425193507	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.460756531275	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.

0.0	0.104618836843	Let me just...
0.0	0.224558211869	I am telling the truth.
0.0	0.206088715899	That's not true.
0.0	0.84732918798	And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.
0.0	0.487146054037	Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.

0.0	0.183582234098	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
0.0	0.160866530426	As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
0.0	0.655217368165	I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
0.0	0.190811670079	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.328031505963	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.455273346463	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.348447126557	And it requires an entire world to come together, including in a very active way, the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.196303702971	It all will be scrutinized.
0.0	0.333535614056	Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values.
0.0	0.250346388858	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
1.0	0.971585157058	Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.
0.0	0.311613480167	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.279313796723	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.0595333507046	They have to be alert to problems.
0.0	0.488113636441	We can't afford another four years of that.

0.0	0.352514645135	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.426835565563	The United States has, unfortunately, been victimized by terrorism going back decades.
0.0	0.151980686622	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.202409683001	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.0703873267865	And, I will tell you, I love my life.
0.0	0.164242234491	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.14407458886	I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran.
0.0	0.664586174788	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.270444468811	We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up.
0.0	0.122934441774	Those are all really positive developments.
0.0	0.305996743095	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.229188471128	Do it.
0.0	0.0759240522256	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.026472216151	): Secretary...
0.0	0.403506297155	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.263915985762	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.132157099189	They're going to come in legally.

0.0	0.0148340261306	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.0587019251812	Nothing's gonna get done.
0.0	0.0167534638447	Yeah.
0.0	0.102728476723	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.290844689026	It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.
0.0	0.177108254375	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.140638316557	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.0743516813185	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.314941455186	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.313452937522	Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin.
0.0	0.298346738439	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.0324807396578	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.232450506015	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.141880283182	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
0.0	0.360003102696	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.14261774178	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.583661644546	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
0.0	0.147674994546	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
1.0	0.889638664208	That's wrong.
0.0	0.258570613105	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.410826744588	Is there an area for a safety net?
1.0	0.953932705369	It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate.
1.0	0.99999981018	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.521252864057	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
1.0	0.721090547339	Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof.
0.0	0.297970154539	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.664714861187	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.12939805177	People who we should be welcoming and working with.
0.0	0.214943452926	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.193768299727	I said, "Is he intelligent?"
0.0	0.0966963411776	And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.
0.0	0.768393088992	I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil.
0.0	0.322769971619	She is not qualified to be President of the United States.
0.0	0.171802967626	They have no choice.
0.0	0.323263883419	Thank you, senator.
1.0	0.999999999968	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.134698635871	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.367252989099	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.200212447146	Yes.
0.0	0.368747061522	It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.
0.0	0.0691680047969	Folks, it's not too late.
0.0	0.256270565196	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
0.0	0.177882557771	Now, what the magic number is, I don't know, because we don't know the extent of the problem.
0.0	0.122854869157	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.219826291418	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.270012947268	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.290449491664	You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.
0.0	0.341705034677	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.170444974601	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.35809190949	I was mentioned in the question.

0.0	0.271676351377	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
1.0	0.999998159828	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.239130293828	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.145619090322	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.0678500864665	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.185296241067	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.228424565444	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.592019471134	We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.
0.0	0.180438939276	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.118089884133	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.287277853823	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
0.0	0.189068878165	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.246472089183	We need to have stronger families.

0.0	0.215132829644	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.413830814109	A lot of the rights that have been won over years, from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights, will be at risk.
0.0	0.212951320862	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.523246938915	It had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.719409880079	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.0913665813025	And I think has had a big impact.
0.0	0.435810670704	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.209267928258	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.399805084855	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.372259167718	What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years.
0.0	0.091622114078	Now I want to go back something.
0.0	0.13623626581	this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.
0.0	0.307654446464	But, of course, international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today.
0.0	0.229188471128	...
0.0	0.168125608144	Now, what does that mean?
0.0	0.605534038012	But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America.
0.0	0.163453566007	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.0229463054292	I'm ready.
0.0	0.578910474854	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.293578643173	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.508068845657	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.142103709997	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.206088715899	That's true.
0.0	0.121140530074	They can't lead us.
0.0	0.595740696188	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.222556925575	I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis.
0.0	0.100296824705	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.277392825936	We have people that aren't smart.
1.0	0.773073724352	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.252271866589	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.390172617912	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.188588081947	I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.
0.0	0.237123013218	The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.105685397552	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
0.0	0.321056465823	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.17028333778	I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization.
0.0	0.0721235307768	We have to come together as a country.
0.0	0.0689989586843	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.239279662709	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.202240770353	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.306282481627	If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration.
0.0	0.371038186339	And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and I would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go.
0.0	0.0311845793799	Right?
0.0	0.463063257199	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.233068835253	But I...
0.0	0.0987813831502	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.302611127834	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.947577951999	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.00877403015949	I will do that.
0.0	0.136118462795	And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.
0.0	0.432449210601	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.0791917850472	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.455987037213	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.101339658449	I believe we've got to go further.
0.0	0.197709385772	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
0.0	0.116011866551	Both served.
0.0	0.387413312919	Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.
0.0	0.323127651329	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.265829446602	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.660858473281	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.274251026442	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.723696584012	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.320511426203	John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.
0.0	0.0950684478706	I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena.
0.0	0.903801100034	He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration.
1.0	0.340209769658	We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
0.0	0.262975849978	I don't get any money from Wall Street.
0.0	0.127797952688	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.0883209778753	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.0988514648402	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.261505968673	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.0629186404615	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.107034467003	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.257245777596	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.102082615502	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.0349183729594	Well, I did.
0.0	0.620105556064	They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.
0.0	0.379518030403	And all over New Hampshire, I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose.
0.0	0.391805568256	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.153952314335	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.47681243842	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.126869923725	They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.
0.0	0.273132512367	They had a plan that was good.
0.0	0.35977177229	Never support.
0.0	0.050696435517	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.171368073662	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.099943125496	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.574931674117	We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.
0.0	0.104723561678	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.0724330415876	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.356585728528	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.
0.0	0.346951953558	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.337316749974	It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state.
1.0	0.433396687861	Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees -- these are big vehicles -- were left behind for the enemy.
0.0	0.12816857128	Well, thanks for having me.
0.0	0.947823085899	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.833749268513	It was an investment bank.
0.0	0.49447952863	We have a corrupt campaign finance system dominated by Super PACs.
0.0	0.156237123264	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.123494275991	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.146964333331	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.28600106826	At the end of the day, if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities.
0.0	0.0691230603427	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.0260139170888	I know.
0.0	0.0419615702765	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.228399255915	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.
0.0	0.523607874039	They have no plan now."
0.0	0.0149681506821	See?
0.0	0.343283741121	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.
0.0	0.163520328312	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.299948242183	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.413392034664	So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.
1.0	0.0707461721031	Don't believe the 5.6.
0.0	0.146737915844	And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in.
0.0	0.210912382706	I never said that.
0.0	0.2611543478	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.5	But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.
0.0	0.130783837807	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.491766197111	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.354832229926	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.308855551214	Well, I think it's perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid.
0.0	0.211829849447	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.837812190411	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.392239092771	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.18864501696	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.0436845362003	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.130021860624	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.129669173671	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.236260416526	He's the greatest show on earth.
0.0	0.801282707782	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.00956309021951	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.624817912731	I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan.
0.0	0.152682092851	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.338305180102	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.118566553197	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.226699109701	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.0106811629867	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.304408128837	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.257854891022	Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.
0.0	0.429391296261	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.237152493141	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.0695719955368	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.
0.0	0.226697089247	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.0724305666866	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.131851417871	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.246634167079	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.680578675428	Yes, well, roughly.
0.0	0.0487384165043	Megyn, that's the problem.
0.0	0.147159161272	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.0896600032406	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.200814575748	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.720234321566	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.223719664293	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.207995796681	Media notwithstanding.
0.0	0.716918897385	What part is valid?
0.0	0.119096200173	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.323405926303	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.189665341928	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.0609076881954	We will win on everything we do.
1.0	0.999999112058	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.272121310266	We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
0.0	0.101737730013	They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.
0.0	0.237615536993	I don't know and with all due respect to the secretary, Wall Street played by the rules?
0.0	0.626295707092	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.206737242712	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.44635988091	I -- you know, know that Senator Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers.
0.0	0.38874542945	Can I share this quick story?
0.0	0.142736246022	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.488544214717	So what I had to do then is go back and start working on a bill that wasn't the bill that I wanted.
0.0	0.262556043834	There are many crises that come -- a water crisis in Toledo.
0.0	0.263799023215	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.528886108503	But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.
0.0	0.237118406901	We were the first in the family.
0.0	0.5	They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of Syria and Iraq.
1.0	0.121975050374	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.309376953552	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.302079524219	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.41440458946	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.121967008898	I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here...
0.0	0.421182264035	We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we're not going to hand out citizenship cards, either.
0.0	0.312444779174	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
1.0	0.807679895915	People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.
0.0	0.0617634231794	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.264116668985	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.131199512177	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.994410901958	So the total is $8,737,540,00.
0.0	0.0411214030674	See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together.
0.0	0.179925544271	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.00542334501602	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.227955636531	This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along.
0.0	0.0260139170888	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.183894491756	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.269326761148	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.343842100865	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.349783632013	When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.
0.0	0.589522086722	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.074393657883	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.419365586067	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.0519074763492	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.108164380152	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.210912382706	I never said that.
0.0	0.301377558117	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.125381199631	We never dreamt we'd ever see it."
0.0	0.21770974841	No one is a socialist.

0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.266681042256	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.

0.0	0.159662644263	That's calling it what it is.
0.0	0.660275344947	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.310562916414	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.416571325665	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.709562972305	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.339388027679	I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.142715857603	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.572331054838	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.250078457961	If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.
0.0	0.368136984141	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.401034882492	I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.
0.0	0.229188471128	But...
0.0	0.974733056546	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.248001249716	They would like to rip it up and start all over again, throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now.
0.0	0.0218707357375	But I learned a lot.
0.0	0.225217314313	We need to do it now as a nation.
0.0	0.0598301898534	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.0149192105141	OK...
0.0	0.351039375167	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.0847652599382	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.
0.0	0.930382477769	We have a stock market that is so bloated.
0.0	0.0388495719887	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.110182166108	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.645651547516	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.0608052094517	Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
0.0	0.256520601757	We saw a Muslim brotherhood president installed, and then we saw him ousted and the army back.
0.0	0.168000777725	What is the best way to do it?
0.0	0.120983761952	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
0.0	0.261432026094	... family leave for a very long time...
0.0	0.336222632848	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.318307935416	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.364801835514	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.519325892062	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.066905017061	Just can't happen.
0.0	0.449564357101	ISIS, now, is the major priority.
0.0	0.194802956324	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...
0.0	0.591055812396	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.402173375055	It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.
1.0	0.990470490335	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
0.0	0.0993028590505	So Hillary and I have a difference.
0.0	0.0748938233299	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.104618836843	Let me just...
0.0	0.350942541908	You've got to go the extra mile.
1.0	0.933727606458	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
0.0	0.294918087119	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.5	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.102954104264	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.0310947167843	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.124551553448	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.0879281201224	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.409189640121	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.247822940989	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.426145400892	And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.
0.0	0.427527212914	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.216137100882	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.865454448441	We raised the minimum wage.
0.0	0.109573096374	And that this world, with American leadership, can and must come together to destroy them.
0.0	0.768018660514	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.0878281620115	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.102379855966	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
0.0	0.0360426163692	And guess what?
0.0	0.146997295076	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.153635509754	Our country has tremendous potential.
0.0	0.269854325251	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.831115356374	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.0725447332036	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.18878626424	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.
0.0	0.149031535267	And we have to stop all the divisions.
0.0	0.135661117036	I think this is a very difficult issue.
0.0	0.0834738838096	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.199774968183	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.0799469229974	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.132499495463	There are hundreds of things like that.
0.0	0.283425745193	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.5	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.298991368462	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.179464471644	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.0755786078689	And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are.
0.0	0.684239661592	No hour is too short, no dollar too small.
0.0	0.0680358844513	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.221809262592	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.270011149187	We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America.
0.0	0.200212447146	Yes.
0.0	0.269214373349	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
1.0	0.37791853328	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.293506295883	My oldest daughter's a teacher.
0.0	0.740119097641	In fact, American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the National Institute of Health and that we then tested through the FDA.
0.0	0.107767677001	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.708923645806	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.019586836853	But you know what else they're anxious about?
0.0	0.170023934289	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.633382994759	But I have another one, Ford.
0.0	0.302318124836	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.0429421007461	That can be done.
1.0	0.784001594014	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.212533223056	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.551004357552	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.999999337076	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.0392342013777	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.185400076697	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.180471075145	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.0571936249094	That makes no sense at all.
0.0	0.104501614225	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.124115423389	That's the future of banking in America.
1.0	0.822826251799	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.300142380621	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.454318727139	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.0475837636426	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.0694726040161	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.267971266134	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.185907973448	You know why three?
0.0	0.462002881908	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.094961654053	I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.
0.0	0.489808331237	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.786109757642	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.0622312950781	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.
0.0	0.330427471625	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.360232534707	Marco opposed this because they made a deal.
0.0	0.255301482295	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.137868695472	I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.
0.0	0.246072729246	Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly.
0.0	0.276059526813	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.
0.0	0.192400312595	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.090210219968	He has gone to China.

0.0	0.213651758511	And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.
0.0	0.196875616915	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.536194798314	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.222564986134	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.248325310878	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.31340146323	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.210418555631	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.101599573522	I learned so much.

0.0	0.175795164761	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.337603023734	If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W.

0.0	0.36875559016	And I think that's the false choice...

0.0	0.121279352566	I heard what they said.
0.0	0.134778353153	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.628793555082	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.0887374661635	Can I just say this...
0.0	0.0374715055615	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.25558074945	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.0149192105141	OK?
0.0	0.560906216962	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.161386113231	They are not going to go away on their own.
0.0	0.194453621776	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.126812721849	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.156777803976	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.24259464106	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.282608279962	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.381591424323	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
0.0	0.537747888852	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.576962463875	Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems.
0.0	0.485472499801	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.283121068988	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.553622675516	I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation.
0.0	0.0632864756183	He was a little teddy bear to me.
0.0	0.255268723058	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.254780399659	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.0762012247905	They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists.
0.0	0.143332578922	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.0412843416846	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.157947942466	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.529131579427	And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.483743336719	And for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.
0.0	0.71841587913	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
0.0	0.0579308949059	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.197834004833	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.229188471128	It's not.
0.0	0.257579591394	The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders.
0.0	0.431595776031	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.0339090708605	Sure did.
0.0	0.0726270038694	I'm running.
0.0	0.2121846892	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.127004472521	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.139706130524	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.542406924094	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.110040304267	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.0700714491443	That is not what America should be about.
1.0	0.774685836652	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
0.0	0.109738632093	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.430567189732	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.430644169775	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.0815851157198	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.159290897592	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.0352132311352	I want security.
0.0	0.355079989998	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
1.0	0.907505825973	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.985963922725	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.132221902222	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.085718609064	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
0.0	0.483935388968	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.278020206351	All of us believe climate change is real.
0.0	0.0236089178989	We did our own rallies.
0.0	0.0104027209778	That's what really matters.
0.0	0.210912382706	I never said that.
0.0	0.117346267173	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.348007599277	When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.0854717473189	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.631411228003	We're spending $80 billion locking people up, disproportionately Latino and African American.
0.0	0.198285028541	We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground."
0.0	0.383655524924	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.
0.0	0.1361375696	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
1.0	0.531703962844	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.112162314984	I said no.
0.0	0.279687884996	That is why we need to make police -- and I speak as a former mayor.
0.0	0.0245906265315	It never happens.
0.0	0.0841441859747	And there are many ways of doing it.
0.0	0.0530565439849	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.
0.0	0.38634414051	Reinstating Glass- Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough.
0.0	0.605730819057	We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq.
0.0	0.381074413079	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.293407548125	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.50511720321	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.203481667529	Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.
0.0	0.669806855486	Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.
1.0	0.995574134811	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.101531644405	People that know me, like me.
0.0	0.0143938103796	We have to do something.
0.0	0.0927409947498	This will end.
0.0	0.139575236372	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.439246679751	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.0627535261038	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.197283883973	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.36514536521	We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents.
0.0	0.27863786089	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.123862222201	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.092997110774	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.0397732226232	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.0189257884649	... issues they have to respond to.
0.0	0.0942204061797	I know the bad ones.
0.0	0.160841265735	And it's impossible for our people here to compete.
0.0	0.273259807481	My heart, like all of us in this room, John, and all the people across our country, my hearts go out to the people of France in this moment of loss.
0.0	0.155972376692	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.395545458225	This country is changing.
0.0	0.269554202578	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.119336540507	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.148947896555	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.0768835870482	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.395131832033	The troops on the ground should not be American troops.
0.0	0.359375117984	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.598067636893	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.0405456199384	We have to stand with them.
1.0	0.859321428693	That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.
1.0	0.999993389416	Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.
0.0	0.240041131049	So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.
1.0	0.985251833719	Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?
0.0	0.076404235281	It was a different situation in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.37019664226	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.666495395331	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.0908906108657	John, I think somewhere between...
0.0	0.0409734180824	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.179951592689	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
0.0	0.212182352121	But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
0.0	0.157648462022	Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us.
0.0	0.289424950308	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.0311845793799	Right.
0.0	0.0341958472303	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.108956645351	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.312339340313	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.200290238922	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.303782124298	Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.454512350596	The first vote hasn't been counted.
0.0	0.0890590167159	You see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, I'm an optimist
0.0	0.00485417830071	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.287860765328	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.195527609536	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.134576135443	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.109870548311	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.376271443964	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.229188471128	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.190656321631	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
1.0	0.99116156171	But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.
0.0	0.924260053525	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.194359791311	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.0475716635483	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.2009012409	Mark my words.
0.0	0.224005420067	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.
0.0	0.0171635916835	As a Catholic, that's what I want to do.
0.0	0.107688186226	And he got nasty.
1.0	0.975594488912	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.550735875037	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.565525376849	About Medicare?
0.0	0.219189943801	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.530914005631	So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.
0.0	0.229188471128	Megyn?
0.0	0.441011592022	So I said, "That's OK." I'm proud of my net worth.
0.0	0.243728806164	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.
0.0	0.238565868373	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.0774586474212	And he is a proud American Muslim.
0.0	0.138411824655	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.588478540844	They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
0.0	0.355493704121	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.840980133226	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.26033600242	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.236539185527	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.020020207385	Why weren't they vigilant?
1.0	0.990956435027	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
0.0	0.391205192926	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.492796840742	And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.
0.0	0.405159095869	Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.235232890601	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.235587142507	This entire question was an attack, but that's (inaudible)
0.0	0.171048393778	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.165328009688	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.318531681415	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.379614779627	We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress, but it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us.
0.0	0.43298681219	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.442726825715	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.677027332269	And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.
0.0	0.123032965788	Sadly, the American dream is dead.
0.0	0.413327131471	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.107767677001	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.263872709667	And now many of these candidates want to cut it.
0.0	0.0260139170888	And you know what?
0.0	0.436879400356	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.127521552593	They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do.
0.0	0.0707461721031	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.19996237093	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
1.0	0.581316385532	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty, and we're the only country in the world -- virtually the only country that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.0195618499679	Think about that.
0.0	0.0440529718074	I think they'd want to hear it.
0.0	0.123454398982	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.108055945092	We don't win.

0.0	0.364892717372	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.0744901998529	I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.
0.0	0.227494445594	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.395445024746	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.113893564678	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.386293635014	There's never going do be perfect bill.
0.0	0.600978244918	I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war.
0.0	0.247874692926	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.435246500725	But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.
0.0	0.254809152195	You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question.
0.0	0.0908441853535	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.25166729321	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.
0.0	0.104945521865	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.270447829391	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.301289574984	People came back from Iraq and Afghanistan without legs, without arms.
0.0	0.682335844337	She's the senator from New York.
0.0	0.313245809849	Rebuild the country's infrastructure.
0.0	0.719537552187	At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.
0.0	0.429079396421	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.233398929277	But if you place good ones, you pocket it.
0.0	0.0834268978862	And I've been there.
0.0	0.140996933002	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.218371502407	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.522008369137	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.0373705179153	We don't know anything about that.
0.0	0.266876957217	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.48304678489	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.245654703599	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.023812142297	You're right.
0.0	0.223954624529	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.12048228846	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.629909015667	hospital that needs to be improved and made better for them turned over to privatization.
0.0	0.258615338724	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.186214677635	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.307495248406	Ninety-three hours.
0.0	0.0941508065295	And, they asked about her email situation.
0.0	0.066968903246	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.474858458705	I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.
0.0	0.740570524997	Number one...
0.0	0.775071051973	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.334127889643	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.0500679309881	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.108379141435	And I believe he is absolutely right.
0.0	0.859569555716	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.423248930194	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.322684672864	But I said, "Don't hit Iraq," because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East.
0.0	0.0895293173534	And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.
0.0	0.381168465979	They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.299479761718	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.138011501174	We saw that in Egypt.
0.0	0.0945038571077	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.18590056794	Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.
0.0	0.590338065512	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.168985590983	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.327712371245	I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.
0.0	0.153577701385	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.745327751409	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.173845453213	I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.
0.0	0.118111913228	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.
0.0	0.0369660566225	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.514298127369	... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.192444457045	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.220115514606	That's because we've put conservative policies in place.
0.0	0.229188471128	...
0.0	0.339015791414	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.70890579327	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.0635912744733	It's great to be back.
0.0	0.0715676175309	Everybody thought it was a done deal.
0.0	0.0230135245344	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.0890074967128	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.0981896212732	Break them up.
0.0	0.610518366073	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.717774868584	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.156202575054	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
1.0	0.940721755861	It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.
0.0	0.478471085712	So there's more to my plan than just the cap.
0.0	0.0833587918977	Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.
1.0	0.778629582611	Today, we have 272.
0.0	0.241473937157	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.0685148556762	Nobody can do that like me.
0.0	0.901777820496	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.0775214387293	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.716408812201	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.112753039672	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.37152785437	And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow.
0.0	0.175766345198	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.783850282621	We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations.
0.0	0.281323946533	And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.
0.0	0.380382122069	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.323162300254	This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.
0.0	0.367548675787	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.156407460985	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
0.0	0.421383836218	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.172468760802	And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
1.0	0.541075024063	But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.
0.0	0.300543073342	The American people are terrified.
0.0	0.141982267056	We were attacked from Afghanistan.
0.0	0.538412270879	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.755337628612	And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.
0.0	0.210204416987	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.258709704404	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.104903835378	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.209945140652	I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.
0.0	0.297533879809	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.243617034491	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.510433289734	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.992472840799	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.0725085818226	We get a traitor.
0.0	0.187069221436	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.278755546873	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.310317866722	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.0527905360097	My background is different.
0.0	0.110720839053	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.375736821491	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.251079142367	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.0770860970324	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
0.0	0.160118960654	It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York.
0.0	0.1638086909	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.605378219846	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.156204960392	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
1.0	0.999999937998	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.166964067985	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.0287822909345	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.183219665675	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.376820823252	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.0738909103152	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.123224078246	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.617220029745	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.229188471128	How about this?
0.0	0.208479297812	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.406747696958	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.229188471128	That's it.
0.0	0.0780733672101	And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party, but of President Obama.
0.0	0.123638471584	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.0689408505393	You've heard some of those tonight.
1.0	0.58477036482	John -- John, this country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.581401805519	I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.
0.0	0.307520671881	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.273123989028	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.0216395989409	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.12191960883	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.16712975224	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.245686766325	And we have people that are controlled by special interests.
0.0	0.103862175738	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.250745575595	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.285343459841	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.736616861354	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
0.0	0.110770689227	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.0576202286495	You know, Ted didn't show up.
0.0	0.057746351025	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.0536481113321	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.143166266808	I'd suggest people take a look at it.
0.0	0.209002230468	We need money.
0.0	0.253360135801	We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
0.0	0.26485423486	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.456541391273	When those buildings came down, she was trapped in her building and I didn't hear from her over six hours.
0.0	0.366354975332	But the facts are simple.
0.0	0.305333252434	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.0167534638447	Yeah.
0.0	0.186188047414	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.305604014255	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.118564344735	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.117427503045	Let me respond...
0.0	0.552089273058	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.108800642564	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
0.0	0.132317457496	The formula is working.
0.0	0.110917153541	It's very important we operate on both at the same time.
0.0	0.232920161622	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.164276441272	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
0.0	0.538649390239	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.194119202898	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.301786152828	They should have made it more open ended for the next president.
0.0	0.010651590213	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.211551937676	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.0812090587375	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.097524547421	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.116105217027	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.0395309370597	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.0335339908898	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.217458597024	And we ought to fight them on that level.
0.0	0.207000253921	The no-fly zone, I would hope, would be also shared by Russia.
0.0	0.356329831487	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.242782825136	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.0319343730664	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.380482293932	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.16206025238	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.108776100746	Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted.
0.0	0.0489348888859	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.201031787047	Go ahead.
0.0	0.0683433450228	If I am elected president...
0.0	0.0864692113332	As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe.
0.0	0.147611573123	The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.
0.0	0.33997441468	But there is a broad consensus on sensible gun safety regulations that I, coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, will do my best to bring together.
0.0	0.0577654467191	So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
0.0	0.614392829553	First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster.
0.0	0.0910130635558	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.200212447146	Yes.
0.0	0.201031787047	Go ahead.
0.0	0.188321501042	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.290895396479	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.0720368654703	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.34419973775	The DNC has hired vendors.
0.0	0.535579620567	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.362025954451	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.0177685055495	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.0636780528543	And I think that's a mistake, and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways.
0.0	0.115007904939	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.0296006654884	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.253660396109	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.135645367863	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.136297094837	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.147116646171	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.530594796092	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.205355773155	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.192863273063	They're a scam.
0.0	0.241664932319	Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.
0.0	0.103186806856	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.231154968042	And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting.
0.0	0.0770574131776	I would not want to go to that point.
0.0	0.423440818746	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.170860342489	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.309902201767	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.111072349708	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.296345217546	It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
0.0	0.351668927705	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.00331493598119	Those are your enemies.
0.0	0.288071199478	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.00626184959033	So did you, Marco.
0.0	0.625209303165	In fact, if you remember, 50, 60 years ago, the University of California, City University of New York were virtually tuition-free.
0.0	0.0883209778753	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.0195725865813	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.377833743198	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.53182883406	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.367756272392	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.00661924887705	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.383310288569	But it was also the cascading effects that followed that.
0.0	0.108722065558	Obama is going to be out playing golf.
0.0	0.125071085168	My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.
0.0	0.406920985038	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.172905746849	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.230886267815	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.234172511266	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.349728975807	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.120350050939	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.0834695486722	Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.
0.0	0.251401685562	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.430662668521	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.0905735876262	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.249839597758	There are a lot of factors involved in that.
0.0	0.0448156939801	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.254726000812	I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States and literally around the world that there is a "clash of civilizations," that there is some kind of Western plot or even "war against Islam," which then I believe fans the flames of radicalization.
0.0	0.16116288456	I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.
0.0	0.412793871591	We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.206497408306	You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future.
0.0	0.113863954903	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
1.0	0.691838164599	Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion.
0.0	0.515547344715	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.183278522198	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.403716523505	And it has three parts.
0.0	0.304978531729	In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men.
0.0	0.295361475484	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.154843835851	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.334536938714	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.145904083385	And we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.
0.0	0.137222800904	Say again?
0.0	0.470977189291	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.26220420026	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.406870954257	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.178887256159	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.0458749066528	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.387392311956	Your question was you have disagreed...
0.0	0.178541917243	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.151892533027	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.166313771141	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.0186310841917	We can do that.
0.0	0.639919322178	That's what I said to my own public health people.
0.0	0.362473810375	And he asked me to support that.
0.0	0.261542343265	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.455910097202	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.124164387716	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.13667496213	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.100918279007	As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans.
0.0	0.661361865575	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.0634745465649	I don't think we're at war with Islam.
0.0	0.31573587638	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
1.0	0.929630944492	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
0.0	0.200212447146	Yes.
0.0	0.163671894592	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
0.0	0.037076876678	it won't happen.
0.0	0.147468447072	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.124694123486	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.263737404919	It's become more complicated.
0.0	0.639282727408	But accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000.
0.0	0.181642868519	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.175362009075	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
1.0	0.319808275609	And some of them are like third world countries.
0.0	0.136677529865	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.493496449867	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.225395441625	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.229188471128	That is what we have to do.
0.0	0.185361195826	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.110144311746	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.0257503527207	they expect to get something.
0.0	0.163164580476	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.0117941564064	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.661725183363	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.0675789635061	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.0272069478082	We have the opposite thinking.
0.0	0.515587865805	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.191815672597	It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.
0.0	0.174525812792	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.215114377459	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.196541723233	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
0.0	0.321464172997	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.165081852642	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.248377638479	This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.
0.0	0.12488917948	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.404298319066	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?
0.0	0.212039411158	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.0711856683769	I think I'm actually a very nice person."
0.0	0.342264586706	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.193950114361	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.0871412687302	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.230981923737	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.0414793902365	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.0562621480718	That's kind of a no-brainer.
0.0	0.0334643539029	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.565896583089	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.0360177296973	And we do have a role in this.
1.0	0.835694986421	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.43055052095	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.524037454896	It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.0775310498587	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.00877403015949	But it will be...
0.0	0.0803309019118	And that's not what's happening now.
0.0	0.466682264593	So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
0.0	0.083406385945	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.0900240403727	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.210998410533	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.079555011994	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.240431800219	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.823517335727	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.13017329045	I was there and I saw the debate.
0.0	0.0753661424566	He's very upset.
0.0	0.179375836361	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.0846773456629	I've always listened to you, Megyn.
0.0	0.472810088727	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.147953733279	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.314113461916	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.354051611013	David, there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees.
0.0	0.351494299775	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.

0.0	0.0577504581806	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.333106962797	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.0464810257705	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.645847331829	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.452242988147	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.112871544089	I'm all about making sure we actually get results for whatever we do.
0.0	0.167208812745	Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.
0.0	0.0703508227413	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.0195618499679	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.156713547048	They come up to my office.
0.0	0.0551931218023	I was the architect.
0.0	0.246716353516	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.331223009205	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.148192680517	I have many friends that deal with China.

0.0	0.229634659236	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.0970381982434	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.421587674679	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.159264307424	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.263120030693	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
0.0	0.31982794939	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.219941767228	But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.
0.0	0.382423920754	The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.304225676792	That is not protected religious belief.

0.0	0.189936293207	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.247555943215	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.473812248059	My name was invoked.
0.0	0.103106567289	And what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.102374467325	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.0761532349657	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.

0.0	0.23261870662	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.842188802074	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.23029501658	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.

1.0	0.176976976092	They're rapists.
0.0	0.0494332406392	But look, we didn't know what was happening next.
0.0	0.369359505212	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.107943870355	Big difference.
0.0	0.0142753334202	You find me...
0.0	0.357806239589	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.688126566287	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.5	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
0.0	0.527246747095	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.10059979576	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.638537546709	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
1.0	0.993065758315	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.0436945084614	He'll say.
0.0	0.105195025499	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.
0.0	0.229188471128	No.
0.0	0.394595423081	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.226579003238	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...
0.0	0.0917793605021	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.0109545016419	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.28197591066	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.0877291610288	Please think of our founding fathers as you listen.
0.0	0.823517335727	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.229188471128	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.061440092878	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.557967308647	But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
0.0	0.0458099399864	If not, they can stay where they are.
0.0	0.239291995926	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.729232246924	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
1.0	0.83964747934	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.165994536253	John.
0.0	0.161229629373	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.208469381422	They went to the DNC quietly.
0.0	0.335358059224	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.707907794624	We reduced violent crime to 30-year lows.
0.0	0.0867005991471	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.661929873373	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.580848595144	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.0233944543486	Whoa.
0.0	0.448359830304	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.18644022598	I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
0.0	0.456051491858	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.0472188038911	I need your help.
0.0	0.405796299342	We brought together legislation supported by the American Legion, the VFW, the DOD, Vietnam Vets, all of the veterans organizations, which was comprehensive.
0.0	0.317967860592	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.255143460638	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.085530230831	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.158552067761	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.137956613004	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.277741857049	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.190721235554	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.200334259397	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.720885574229	I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...
0.0	0.245689287329	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.0307651456736	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.274518350923	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.193610588282	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.314161186878	This is revolutionary for education in America.
0.0	0.195028256148	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.347398148908	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.801320825845	People have been paying it for years.
0.0	0.165741503663	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.0966924569599	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.151432197195	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.625497977835	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.261701185814	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.753636638212	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.530618547561	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
0.0	0.152375544525	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.219439954957	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.11990299262	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.359850677594	I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.
0.0	0.374231747504	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.217111933844	I mean, let's talk about this arc of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about.
0.0	0.563320566829	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.393902499896	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.0171543787753	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.139445765824	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.104488670979	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
0.0	0.117564928003	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.0489002266496	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.0568286706436	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.139481267061	I know every one.
0.0	0.538363438514	The world has changed.
1.0	0.842717477554	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
0.0	0.150030394169	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.22569067432	Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem.
0.0	0.0977067773148	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.262316923397	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.789387546768	Seventeen more million more people have health care.
0.0	0.292345642485	I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
0.0	0.246787400114	And she turned around many lives.
0.0	0.127790686073	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.431896947623	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.49175486464	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.316276621357	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.159960448782	Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take.
1.0	0.973857475185	Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.
0.0	0.579388784602	Since, you know, the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody.
0.0	0.164352969352	You are working at McDonald's?
1.0	0.89186109812	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.182381676502	Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.
0.0	0.0537078799729	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.221931560634	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.433946032115	I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.0116874473544	They're not good.
0.0	0.152900457788	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.180487191219	We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists.
0.0	0.102376275861	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.0809000345286	They are ripping us.
0.0	0.176243639407	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.144558452262	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.33907969333	And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, "if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed.
0.0	0.215618230718	And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe.
0.0	0.189400760443	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.0349885195965	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.309478726424	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.230693209195	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
0.0	0.607120003396	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.175407890252	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.169204948975	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.116990506773	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.359944691254	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
0.0	0.550493067941	I do not support amnesty...
0.0	0.426602773675	People were just being fined to death.
0.0	0.952614123146	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
0.0	0.152119834309	We are doing both at the same time.
0.0	0.0974320110833	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.391294708653	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.686092064173	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.0522436350838	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.349145020972	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.34536402441	When somebody is addicted and seeking help, they should not have to wait three, four months in order to get that help.
0.0	0.394405626528	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.306231173586	We also have to build a coalition at home.
0.0	0.166312153422	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.255129079632	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.0449985156772	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.0398690779723	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.388823097838	And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation.
0.0	0.580709964961	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.0362778388274	I think he is right.
0.0	0.178867245348	I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.
0.0	0.338517503948	When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.
0.0	0.728252769055	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.0594346354087	There's give and take.
0.0	0.294406567674	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.430230489853	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.17939137278	And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives.
0.0	0.298398799256	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.665558961577	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.321954467296	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.183893601985	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.369689180484	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.382335252876	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.196510119561	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.48519667491	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.286350030171	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
0.0	0.878428982759	To get deregulated -- listen to this, they spent $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions over a 10-year period.
0.0	0.165994536253	So was I, John.
0.0	0.112346895045	And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...
0.0	0.440904970011	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
1.0	0.939218667981	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.241486667949	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
0.0	0.17053640405	I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace.

0.0	0.133499627294	China is ripping us on trade.

0.0	0.670078555683	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.141764154934	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.118542466542	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.660027058452	And then on top of that, we've got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are pouring huge sums of money into super PACS heavily influencing the political process.
0.0	0.217788683768	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.35153373551	It has too much economic power.
0.0	0.402536415076	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.299962575989	First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.
0.0	0.238186723947	Germany, many other countries do it already.
0.0	0.267297963236	And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.
0.0	0.272320493226	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.0260139170888	You know why?
0.0	0.10890789545	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.307680481962	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.348815806932	Then, in 2008, you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying that we don't need those regulations on the federal level and now you're coming back around here.
0.0	0.0444637294631	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.151097028081	I started off -- thank you -- I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said -- and I love my father.
0.0	0.590296548906	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.200212447146	Yes.
0.0	0.327483275826	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.307374722328	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.242719857038	... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region.
0.0	0.0717435742409	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.463178094847	Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world.

0.0	0.0680556617223	We got it.

0.0	0.102674249914	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.112716181591	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.0732188835413	... and I'd like to respond.
0.0	0.586040196272	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.200830100473	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
0.0	0.469455916819	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.279339955934	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.200077875499	That's the right of people.
0.0	0.466968346974	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.229188471128	...
0.0	0.561963496419	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.334428612095	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.354791179869	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
1.0	0.99422531095	When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.
0.0	0.191160319383	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.114833067718	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
1.0	0.979126948856	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
1.0	0.984522971325	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.1747978634	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.142965899324	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.
0.0	0.129484479447	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.0553466806126	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
1.0	0.968184538921	Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.
0.0	0.0248041217786	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.367288032563	May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care?
0.0	0.192589417911	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.458700263663	Why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want?
0.0	0.101851512247	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.176546649713	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.
0.0	0.920368654166	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.0470124384842	I understand.
0.0	0.315398143764	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.687493548359	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.146095959807	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.528932894762	If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship.
0.0	0.337911816256	And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.330808672285	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.0633649063656	We need to figure this out together.
0.0	0.113132092318	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.300305321538	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.0610528457436	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.37202467746	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.319440158004	Again, with all do respect to Secretary Clinton...
0.0	0.348358239313	Why do -- why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major -- the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?
0.0	0.0260139170888	We know...
0.0	0.603125493202	According to the economists -- who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying -- that $24 trillion -- we're very close -- that's the point of no return.
0.0	0.119860737389	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.175834970254	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.045848565562	We get Bergdahl.
0.0	0.343245305142	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.263288844974	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.385120608239	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.635902431274	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.0683213771577	You just can't do it.
0.0	0.303715021762	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
0.0	0.272888369608	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.168977679413	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.778879176183	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.894113662007	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.274951044056	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.451840599215	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.26381427491	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.270061749096	But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks."
0.0	0.432876489411	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.
0.0	0.0684073556772	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.456389122183	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.21272222012	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.0455826112818	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.274962585426	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.0446139934717	We need security.
0.0	0.14790968548	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.196885128926	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.141420776742	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.163134722791	And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016.
0.0	0.360026509858	ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.
0.0	0.0770618960357	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.0642363104093	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.430184237475	No, what I would say is this is look, I was the first of the three of us to call for America to accept the 65,000 refugees we were asked to accept.
0.0	0.428149600983	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.312886504013	That's a drag on the economy.
0.0	0.0444837804664	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.0332488888911	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.0311845793799	She was right.
0.0	0.0374695912496	Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.
0.0	0.278577506384	You know where their United States headquarters is located?
0.0	0.128721719093	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.00485417830071	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.101930720491	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.25797592663	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.312074517669	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.779834454331	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.199751883056	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.130893361706	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.0260139170888	And you know what?
0.0	0.344234991872	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.0102486345044	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.0313991637486	No, Martha, I would not.
0.0	0.223411320121	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.0652702263107	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.372270591943	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.10956399981	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.140190490409	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
0.0	0.227192354507	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.434139677355	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.841599159994	Number one, there are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.229188471128	That's what it is.
0.0	0.240532683505	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.0752572739577	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.568656416498	We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force.
0.0	0.0608028173566	I just want a job.
0.0	0.170918897975	Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense.
0.0	0.226902483013	To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.
0.0	0.185296241067	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.416233231219	But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said.
0.0	0.229188471128	What should we do?
0.0	0.752152321306	Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.216336965792	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.347207700823	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.41801892262	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.177034985779	The answer is no.
0.0	0.854782720809	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.229188471128	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.0880888082631	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.
0.0	0.388506091759	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.303154640503	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.181333019251	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.353095489171	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.258185122239	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.204305031307	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.89186109812	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.396048366512	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.18029123995	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.222196102282	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.434083426173	They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.
0.0	0.928368247294	You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56 percent, equivalent to 56 percent of the GDP In America.
0.0	0.475887861264	When he brought forward the "Gang of Eight" bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.
0.0	0.393754698142	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
1.0	0.995108710692	Very few children.
0.0	0.303376981534	It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.
0.0	0.16712975224	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.590866589289	When you ran in 2000, you said that we needed federal robust regulations.
0.0	0.566257667277	Tear down the EPA's blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates.
0.0	0.0836598576751	We need much more than that.
0.0	0.403970230879	And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it.
0.0	0.229188471128	Again...
0.0	0.262081546699	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.229188471128	It is.
0.0	0.13978934909	So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.
0.0	0.0822566236984	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.0319283271904	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.222891060093	Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves.
0.0	0.39717615767	And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't.
0.0	0.0640285794274	He was such a nice guy.
1.0	0.992213038265	I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance.
0.0	0.308687938695	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.433101034573	I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department.
0.0	0.183995223696	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.783298498376	Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts.
0.0	0.365168724982	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.
0.0	0.142087644047	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.5	But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance.
0.0	0.1196758735	Who do you know will defend life, marriage and religious liberty?
0.0	0.059643479958	You know, this is not easy work.
0.0	0.234623890834	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.225983780191	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.0483140405905	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.168533734709	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.391745546232	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.155266357774	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
0.0	0.329288900039	Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values.
0.0	0.637432172198	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.235289916923	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.213623205172	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.13372122409	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.0592418922493	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.207249377398	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.177403765634	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.284609093273	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.229188471128	No.
0.0	0.0273834478305	So be very, very careful.
0.0	0.707378980735	... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.
0.0	0.362776592331	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.204412081595	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.159575792796	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.424497737206	And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.
0.0	0.212905731629	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.268294582311	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.072400045656	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
1.0	0.969245818427	We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.
0.0	0.2314922522	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.0408539671818	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.0464877065216	They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.
0.0	0.265883510017	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.0712135647595	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.0616809388759	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.808532445127	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.835889414277	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
1.0	0.803391884937	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.335022319476	So -- because we got to make the country rich.
0.0	0.259423417112	That means medical.
0.0	0.100457078883	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
0.0	0.061981085322	Came out great.
0.0	0.261914966863	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.555275466444	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.
0.0	0.115949571501	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.648720310035	That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
1.0	0.988866311482	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.186829319042	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.222784178093	Let's be frank here.
0.0	0.571307460619	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.717668795831	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.605499734597	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.230520481843	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.341257448307	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.0627527194375	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.67525385099	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.514154025356	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.271288895132	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.0849227010989	Excuse me.
1.0	0.965646690829	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.0734726185319	We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.
0.0	0.132974947372	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.379732459343	And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.0613708091266	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.654025424138	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.134713915561	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.210429745782	Last point.
0.0	0.0539926714982	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.337127287966	People have invested a lot of energy into that.
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.328994179441	We only have one or two.
0.0	0.171518637512	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.131329962863	They don't even have a chance.
0.0	0.264699055301	We've been at this a couple of years.
0.0	0.557120508796	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.125333994954	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.555245488773	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.725569066421	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.380410171269	I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college.
0.0	0.286710474497	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.46665132707	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.358864452025	I want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, which they have not been doing.
0.0	0.142601286456	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.139389180662	She wants to pursue the American dream.
0.0	0.082891505422	I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...
0.0	0.226351501249	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.00552115679122	Looking forward to it.
0.0	0.128463196499	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
0.0	0.363480933071	It's virtually useless.
0.0	0.954754586387	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.642441173514	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.234180447989	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.52217130853	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.159196728131	They're building up their military to a point that is very scary.
0.0	0.30349261605	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.1876669443	We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be -- and -- and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody.
0.0	0.255626477325	Or a young woman who had been performing at President Obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member.
0.0	0.0857297605777	I said, "I don't need it.
0.0	0.972075304024	So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion.
0.0	0.217690255923	I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support.
0.0	0.725065908286	We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
0.0	0.45436657545	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.0132124654308	We serve you.
0.0	0.633805857779	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
1.0	0.997245967777	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.18503266521	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.268176334566	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.486179613478	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.340294633252	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.0260139170888	But you know what?
0.0	0.189890255506	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.37240938654	And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.
0.0	0.551702657163	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.
0.0	0.315239009894	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.200212447146	Yes.
0.0	0.161734517765	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.623459195845	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.109259028145	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.15503729154	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.0147356353197	It can happen.
0.0	0.302408953622	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
1.0	0.934429611122	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.389267147446	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.331506987408	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.420033812369	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.765767011702	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.648032818064	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.0523204536139	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.274527023635	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
0.0	0.180765734814	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.107049878653	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.14648277655	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.0889900684456	They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
0.0	0.234854940333	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.190301042177	He is a good man.
0.0	0.138316137099	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.0190480614815	I agree with them.
0.0	0.124854888581	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.020068894421	I like them.
0.0	0.347945719163	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.420855111173	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.148843048847	Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president.
0.0	0.569566613743	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.0703018969073	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.160062762494	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.120802450241	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.283817293947	It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.
0.0	0.00302303273442	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.185804945414	And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
0.0	0.206088715899	It's not true.
0.0	0.0767481218848	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.128822076756	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.555372002673	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
1.0	0.690683284528	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.143332578922	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.646957570612	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.1172165744	And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.
0.0	0.229188471128	We have to do it.
0.0	0.066791230797	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.145769183776	If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
0.0	0.239500213102	In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.870092542411	Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble.
0.0	0.179885555797	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.229188471128	So did you.
1.0	0.670427488354	$10.10 was all I could get the state to do by the time I left in my last year.
0.0	0.157201366713	Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.
0.0	0.42790177572	We need, basically, to pledge that we're going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.
0.0	0.0676313815774	And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.
1.0	0.685246248585	It's never below zero.
0.0	0.102483728829	Thank you very, very much.
0.0	0.217103228106	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.220804748118	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.617274881288	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.406558508846	Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.
0.0	0.00509961089873	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
1.0	0.993712099952	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.0976240097545	We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.
1.0	0.914918475487	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.408396780294	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.196693299561	We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.
0.0	0.133727300571	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.

0.0	0.0233944543486	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
0.0	0.73056943614	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.371381600614	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.

0.0	0.550393127474	We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate.
0.0	0.515782847532	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.154261040577	Absolutely.
0.0	0.193470286324	And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before.
0.0	0.216553807989	We went after those who had attacked us.
0.0	0.215161919812	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.023812142297	You're right.
0.0	0.43041110207	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.
0.0	0.137503607974	And we should be a welcoming nation.

0.0	0.561851582107	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.

0.0	0.112424823268	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.125275359079	Thank you, John.
0.0	0.0548890560426	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.

0.0	0.00859692363006	And that's what's happening.
0.0	0.852656950436	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.376077142224	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.

0.0	0.0962935590741	I think that what we're facing with ISIS is especially complicated.

0.0	0.216640289662	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.142358172717	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.438422200708	We don't eliminate Medicare.
0.0	0.235080424203	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.167916859762	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.0991972109232	You don't serve us.
0.0	0.333461999104	So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income.
0.0	0.161132408255	Could I just say -- just say this...
0.0	0.341473359188	Hey, I have lobbyists.
0.0	0.114861452561	If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say?
0.0	0.210912382706	I never said that.
0.0	0.337359164382	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
0.0	0.0864297373432	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.66794067975	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
1.0	0.90004850812	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.255619876283	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.460063359782	So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act.

0.0	0.114011995562	We have losers.
0.0	0.156872374579	And I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern.
0.0	0.462173937165	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.360505773437	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.293377295679	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.270114454867	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.0855245635801	Now they're going militarily.
0.0	0.196295533041	We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?
0.0	0.29323942993	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.633528740394	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
0.0	0.733000014169	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.266153232649	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.70627334375	I've employed -- I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
0.0	0.16918094304	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.0635649148471	... What was your question...
0.0	0.0232727643048	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.318998438353	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.032542388198	That is important.
0.0	0.172954934674	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
0.0	0.0377222396344	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.
0.0	0.556918525926	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.116841096628	I said, "I gotta go into Manhattan.
1.0	0.492271610525	In 1988, I lost an election because I said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of America.
0.0	0.587633417186	And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.227957739189	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.154342430325	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.0759779258226	We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression.
0.0	0.611501299727	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.33647726585	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.294297076729	You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.
0.0	0.11493427343	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.962918771763	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.154261040577	Absolutely.
0.0	0.127508056258	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
1.0	0.574735438131	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.845747851398	My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.0126539350718	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.149108100867	There are a lot of things we've got to do in our country, reigning in Wall Street is certainly one of them.
0.0	0.152388120661	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.296032644032	When was the last time you heard China is killing us?
0.0	0.14400791534	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
0.0	0.109682700137	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.36148068877	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.602412068555	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.301508426015	I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail.
0.0	0.522874047097	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.
0.0	0.828319187113	Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system.
0.0	0.48607827522	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
0.0	0.231487189349	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.
0.0	0.217685539221	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.114264316721	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.0773105128713	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
0.0	0.0907275113546	I said, "I don't know."
0.0	0.179052447419	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.242569848767	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.197912169673	As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election.
0.0	0.446416188194	I believe that our Federal Government needs to do more on pell grants.
0.0	0.254532385538	And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.0965376562057	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.0149192105141	OK.
0.0	0.443350143688	First of all...
0.0	0.0491438821602	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.774874837018	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.546952356817	I think that is the number one requirement.
0.0	0.550547815865	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.081102659487	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.362715138931	They want American troops back in the Middle East.
0.0	0.48668882939	I changed that.
1.0	0.999999205846	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.117821404178	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.732286914946	They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
0.0	0.594122863727	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.189628792058	When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.
0.0	0.2451690804	We offered a lot more.
0.0	0.256864785227	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.169037532871	I am glad Donald is running.
0.0	0.877612218795	If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.
0.0	0.40113192123	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.343233142321	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.656038450719	Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military.
0.0	0.0297150163057	I'm getting to that.
0.0	0.61142817662	But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks.
0.0	0.139887940903	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.261647468425	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.664117956438	Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.
0.0	0.402201270274	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.171686002427	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.845974866194	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.0311845793799	That's right.
0.0	0.5	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.0707790168689	And you have to really work hard at it.
0.0	0.339399649675	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.

0.0	0.447231462692	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.66725065668	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
1.0	0.890430361132	And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
0.0	0.342841919386	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.0253943545232	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.161592754152	He just writes out an executive order.

0.0	0.160648231839	Today I heard it.
0.0	0.411636531041	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.344377258994	And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.
0.0	0.107535162968	I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is.
0.0	0.135143589835	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.153770338452	They will not bring us -- believe me -- to the promised land.
0.0	0.849788692925	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.342708201919	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.
0.0	0.327549081278	It's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement.
0.0	0.16729855837	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.267922585619	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.0339090708605	That's for sure.
0.0	0.387448873454	So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again.
0.0	0.614210808167	When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it.
0.0	0.113184575246	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.

0.0	0.38182342765	I know that because I buy the product."
0.0	0.209805308953	I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.

0.0	0.103096564868	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.205662204434	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.0642585070942	It's what they call it.
0.0	0.595696170469	We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.
0.0	0.113004351422	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.17130391242	The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.
0.0	0.0739217707492	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.232213127998	But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue -- requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.082807393816	That's just media stuff.
0.0	0.143787170023	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.

0.0	0.528511014488	And so, look, the way that -- a stronger middle class is actually the source of economic growth.
0.0	0.245586108989	When you come back to me, I'll share that story.
0.0	0.0240097349902	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.84123478507	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.53737152682	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.112835106137	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.162018425441	Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.866375629916	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.635265158411	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.102055367273	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.317980748144	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.175163306666	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
0.0	0.16775269501	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.2685349137	At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically.
1.0	0.967810952021	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.622134708144	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.407065909235	I've prosecuted terrorists.
0.0	0.244022529844	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.0487384165043	The problem is...
0.0	0.197729211951	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.

0.0	0.144599251674	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.

0.0	0.0248799197296	I love China.

0.0	0.123411479007	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.182969408188	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.868728029152	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.

0.0	0.204389918735	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.154261040577	Absolutely.
0.0	0.13757610321	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.16694314348	They beat us all the time.
0.0	0.455345648937	Social Security, which Republicans call a Ponzi scheme, may face privatization.
0.0	0.179662931037	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.183924358428	When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal?
0.0	0.440061524162	We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love -- they're great -- all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.
0.0	0.0435012230086	Syria is a mess.
0.0	0.863590190862	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.0486332877507	I don't think so.
0.0	0.197930983443	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.425466721595	Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.140602417783	Well, there are so many, I don't know where to start.
0.0	0.0923056417536	We're going to create a border.

0.0	0.177002378228	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.569287560898	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.22019958728	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.105777074938	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.217912872956	And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.
0.0	0.130321607089	As governor, we continued to work together.

0.0	0.104710164859	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.0815035266234	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.126833827152	We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.
0.0	0.38639361425	And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years.
0.0	0.867167787473	But -- but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages.
0.0	0.161938964373	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.183186750565	And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.
0.0	0.288030821234	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.52355461719	I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader.
0.0	0.223334813018	That was good for New York.

0.0	0.717304429789	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.0657140535101	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.292291111847	My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves.
0.0	0.17999042678	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.178670530962	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
1.0	0.836122560844	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.402557685318	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.306916903628	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.283205176949	So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.
0.0	0.177573084474	I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.

0.0	0.391187108285	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.582754357605	Who are we kidding?
0.0	0.0560459468779	It is a tragedy all over this country.
0.0	0.443093847773	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.293858625183	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.3368127509	And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence.
0.0	0.339255964044	This is not the type of campaign that we run.
0.0	0.491921314064	... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...

0.0	0.015172511001	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.0823516798757	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.0731411869719	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.182490246554	Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.311584146338	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.297574149514	... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience.
0.0	0.0390667025781	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.334370141198	So I believe that, in fact, this country needs to move towards a living wage.
0.0	0.100814076005	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.206088715899	It's true.
0.0	0.847362337086	In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.
0.0	0.196383627107	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.137373262257	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.305740729712	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.
0.0	0.210466818968	I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.
0.0	0.270869594512	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.120551591644	Well, I just want to quickly add...

0.0	0.170478704034	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.208389403067	Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.
0.0	0.289398758181	But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that.
1.0	0.994257797004	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.112162314984	That's what I said.
0.0	0.365752831593	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.

0.0	0.0144639661766	And I'm confident we can do that.

0.0	0.159862364285	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.178905861241	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.
0.0	0.156575792449	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.

0.0	0.368880425483	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.356822320941	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.

0.0	0.654775854717	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.

0.0	0.391264611828	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.932698864039	They would have to pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.508482950389	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.740309679747	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.409134027396	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.
0.0	0.180437762022	My wife, Jane, has been -- way back when before I knew her, a foster parent.
0.0	0.597719583771	Kathie, that is the kind of economy I believe, put money in the hands of working people, raise the minimum wage to 15 buck an hour.
0.0	0.335920086441	Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military.
0.0	0.5	Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place.
0.0	0.875286021044	We end up paying the highest prices in the world.
0.0	0.780735225444	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.299860488236	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.451407459414	And so people are still going to get health care, thankfully, in emergency rooms, in hospitals.
0.0	0.230255421928	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.0867821975283	...the only reason is -- look...
0.0	0.932698864039	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.251622277189	You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes.
0.0	0.0767192071018	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.130349131451	in particular.
0.0	0.149124533647	There must be some way.
0.0	0.157627540729	That's fine.
0.0	0.306237812465	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.701842458864	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.367617249847	So I said (ph), "No, that's the wrong number.
0.0	0.517701692617	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
1.0	0.637529729717	We passed it after 9/11.
0.0	0.401005418337	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.0400600001968	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.161634826676	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.266968487937	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.526411559509	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.130097521104	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.250849737413	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.229188471128	What do we do?
0.0	0.718483809608	He has never defended...
0.0	0.558067209509	I do respect Rand.
0.0	0.234051091356	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.110039523778	It's great to be at Trump Tower.
0.0	0.605846763399	You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.
0.0	0.141245477958	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.131489025148	You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.
0.0	0.329692050954	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.333916805995	I saw Ted Cruz say, "we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill."
0.0	0.189561217784	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.0343658336121	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.39290274564	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.0464302399922	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.256988849846	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.162094743547	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
0.0	0.123149391245	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.0337075895336	And it isn't because I'm all that great.
0.0	0.138188119478	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.333258475626	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.463254476011	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.0625825814531	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
0.0	0.387877303244	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.
0.0	0.0771538415916	We're running.
0.0	0.22297956058	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.168757812283	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.578369899923	Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs.
0.0	0.148839857438	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.116237144171	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.0733506683606	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.420605514792	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
0.0	0.27200671177	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.
0.0	0.0539144643569	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.0679233042128	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.0412762539188	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.0962740262768	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
0.0	0.404948716513	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.147742270407	Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem.
0.0	0.0683661379937	She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.
0.0	0.387717115284	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.0882716728322	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.221112461545	And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.
0.0	0.236011913499	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.393006866523	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.
0.0	0.275279478787	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.360857267146	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.369766551893	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.0126539350718	Don't do it."
0.0	0.0597722793278	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.303050973663	First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.212764229241	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.264127371286	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.0804702073306	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.169542732211	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.270897450408	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.258092722197	I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.
0.0	0.181357785289	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.411279446877	Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago.
0.0	0.118034452898	They blow people up.
0.0	0.257970149128	And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.
0.0	0.490939518881	What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people.
0.0	0.42036285049	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.243447630271	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.108738254905	That's when we become Greece.
0.0	0.303375224823	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.337936349874	Major crisis and primary health care.
0.0	0.0382281616782	Wait for what?
0.0	0.173487476819	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.2817901676	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.345190630059	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.186408850305	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.258403967503	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.386564817958	Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country.
0.0	0.970320770177	Do the $12 and you would index it.
0.0	0.764089905688	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.149907022563	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.236150669155	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.216775915146	We are at war with violent extremism.
0.0	0.366490948417	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.369999172131	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.331945339936	Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization called ISIS.
0.0	0.0433017342401	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.422378465747	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.112374367264	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.109177910123	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.0358963805578	And, look, there are profound differences...
0.0	0.0902713637527	He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
0.0	0.292424795483	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.094239783401	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.12754406309	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.0695024482612	They don't know how to bring it about.
0.0	0.191325215179	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.300793394587	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
0.0	0.229188471128	No -- no...
0.0	0.215361495706	By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa.
0.0	0.546743990955	Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable?
0.0	0.0131792875406	Alright.
0.0	0.230768592526	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.
0.0	0.0949252625127	Our vets may see the V.A.
0.0	0.130581335805	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.05365665163	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.237374442174	But he used to say, "Donald, don't go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.156635549555	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.239798451875	Well, I just think you're asking a question with a false choice.
0.0	0.0311845793799	All right.
0.0	0.187894079924	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.118756795567	They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn.
0.0	0.269088323345	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.907432705677	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
0.0	0.301162123934	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.21601937637	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.455263214023	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.190204882463	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.
0.0	0.568115795271	We have to do away with the strawman proposal.
0.0	0.117717342938	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.261316695551	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.479199034296	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.245352792114	Good company.... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in -- and I wouldn't even use -- you know, I have -- I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
0.0	0.918877882535	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.173590925281	Well, David, I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country.
0.0	0.299730494802	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.199597204878	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.292059627179	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.132045950319	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.0474509990453	Well, sure.
0.0	0.141504598062	And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.
0.0	0.368960786635	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.105694388854	We saw a dictator overthrown.
1.0	0.983714822335	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.21098836757	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.903398458568	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.176740490178	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.
0.0	0.236741548907	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.137222800904	And before I say it, I have to say this.
0.0	0.315544926862	Got to go to Haiti last year.
0.0	0.142507203247	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.179684576238	Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country.
0.0	0.208734113895	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.372500937613	But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone.
0.0	0.213996267524	I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries.
0.0	0.0348964719192	And they're all over the place.
0.0	0.34524066189	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.0949599827791	I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.
0.0	0.621954573215	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.212553282447	But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country.
0.0	0.105522245889	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.582094646865	First of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy, as you've indicated.
0.0	0.217952895589	The intelligence was by no means absolute.
0.0	0.0412209548992	We know about the French.
0.0	0.0334990398275	I want a job."
0.0	0.229188471128	You do.
0.0	0.307189148445	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.0655702855296	You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America.
0.0	0.315852009288	I say, "That's a terrible story.
0.0	0.0820560335078	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.0840852317	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.185328777043	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.
0.0	0.11756489065	He's a bad negotiator.
0.0	0.0260139170888	They know.
0.0	0.131844709675	Well, thank you, John.
0.0	0.173882452041	Do I take the product?
1.0	0.446093428491	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.0747586563015	And it's an honor to have everybody here.
0.0	0.122643461175	And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?
0.0	0.404077300374	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.

0.0	0.201656754967	And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.
0.0	0.00589743950807	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.436935074231	For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check.
0.0	0.287586587825	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.0147356353197	It can happen.
0.0	0.0991723873939	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.14538901936	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.0980043726305	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.95193858986	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.465885360578	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.342152516058	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.411123207244	This is absolutely absurd.
0.0	0.229188471128	No.
0.0	0.028384803448	Chris?
0.0	0.299829875587	Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength.
0.0	0.482537283331	A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.
0.0	0.518444108007	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.0802451938693	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.
0.0	0.510201225181	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.854779947015	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.53592622763	I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.
0.0	0.295969641587	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.159264307424	But let's be clear.
0.0	0.102784395907	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.901397190013	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.687199507818	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.0830499954601	Now I'm not doing that...I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?
0.0	0.635424087186	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.306033485049	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.565799846545	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.300538120933	I think the issue here is -- and I applaud Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.555513649643	When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.
0.0	0.348998548349	That is our government today.
0.0	0.492423473829	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
0.0	0.643292550212	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.968031806929	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.0987784616553	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.0493311515526	He didn't know.
0.0	0.109627161979	I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.
0.0	0.817774807278	Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978.
0.0	0.107999212449	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.328328284008	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
0.0	0.00302303273442	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.203587153282	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.61048558789	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.0648553780318	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.
0.0	0.138906743119	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.
0.0	0.458647344247	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.109399661063	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.620101432656	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.192306892542	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.541628837852	In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, "Donald, you don't have enough borrowings.
0.0	0.117673394076	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.672643833081	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.127631366712	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.103025778166	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.398258857232	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.
0.0	0.34021086374	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.210177641885	Let me give you the bad news.
0.0	0.293958134394	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.164371015911	A military island.
0.0	0.111791711019	You want to know what carpet bombing is?
0.0	0.5	... that's the -- that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration.
0.0	0.808464642931	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.673972617705	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.413823770008	The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign.
0.0	0.0116664935868	And there's a lot.
0.0	0.169387302762	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.0943017789267	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.144276927148	It goes away.
0.0	0.212524314915	I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.
0.0	0.262917740371	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.0870997478353	They're not so stupid.
0.0	0.0644575010004	But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
0.0	0.481323412662	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.449442099105	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.337488451784	I'm not using the lobbyists.
0.0	0.0693569295996	It is not a barbed wire fence.
0.0	0.364432835813	That's the secondary issue.
0.0	0.676560295887	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.
1.0	0.608711952183	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.524429022107	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.0567365261248	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.0487384165043	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.361230263439	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.
0.0	0.0126165919842	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.27446479942	I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country.
0.0	0.916358181923	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.100723959924	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.352024624473	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
1.0	0.969153325583	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.3943933852	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
0.0	0.0962240696937	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.082647738126	There won't be any -- you can get it.
0.0	0.232798709126	They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.
0.0	0.238902635792	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.
0.0	0.307631024834	In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill, "Well I assume Hillary has told you about this."
0.0	0.0911722742004	I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.
0.0	0.201798176852	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.429556559743	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.
0.0	0.0486332877507	No, I don't think so.
0.0	0.208683603711	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.124938035934	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.349380974706	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.261560495963	Ask Boeing.
0.0	0.131067773898	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.332050864905	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.110560810788	And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.
0.0	0.0544020615038	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.0259875467914	You are not our adversary, you are our partner.
0.0	0.455496284383	If they want to accept our values and our laws.
0.0	0.390734560773	They've advertised that.
0.0	0.0672645207334	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.229188471128	It was...
0.0	0.0311845793799	That is not right.
0.0	0.0689512579258	It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee.
0.0	0.27616810593	And we have to do more to prevent the flood of foreign fighters that have gone to Syria, especially the ones with western passports, that come back.
0.0	0.371046669279	KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.
0.0	0.433013955065	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
1.0	0.27074172476	When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.0825075132872	Let's...
0.0	0.0844132186311	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.678725172987	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.261230596239	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.345410810546	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.024794273851	We're dying.
0.0	0.257403739219	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.180185488628	It will give hope to millions of young people.
0.0	0.251040711004	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.0767465510258	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.177914401661	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.14818577792	We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America.
0.0	0.229188471128	No, I have not.
0.0	0.636693724855	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.113692984277	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.267654769117	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.64356839543	We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
0.0	0.398581754148	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.0910376030519	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.171398978969	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.251411021224	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.222557210656	So, yes, I did know people.
0.0	0.16105993801	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.0149192105141	OK?
0.0	0.195420734731	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.416364247387	They;re gone.
0.0	0.386175516939	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.07669365463	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.254236423178	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.0195618499679	They think they are.
0.0	0.257624445083	And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
0.0	0.124404850155	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.0975595717575	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.408579282636	Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody.
0.0	0.206088715899	No, it's true.
0.0	0.037076876678	It won't happen.
0.0	0.400088755209	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.0114534634084	How great is that?
0.0	0.23729511327	Revolution never came.
1.0	0.5	2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.
0.0	0.232896460725	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.0339090708605	Sure.
0.0	0.143609113945	There has never been a jihadist group like this.
0.0	0.137017701371	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.385156388552	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.036514512518	Thank you, Marco.
0.0	0.0950689104432	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.195956365004	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.459849952876	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.039483340838	I'm proud of my family.
0.0	0.0971891182505	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.112312926923	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.332866488019	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.0330925585872	We need to stop that.
1.0	0.923094692837	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
0.0	0.222089067329	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.490491046962	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.179469175502	I've done an amazing job.
0.0	0.275304871878	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.
0.0	0.302559722074	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.5	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.145299715903	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.0375098820816	He's not a leader.
0.0	0.506106524949	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.565889299899	And if they have to be in the Middle East for 20 or 30 years no problem.
0.0	0.188911325278	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.185449439278	They've got nothing but money.
0.0	0.0680358844513	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.0962665248473	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.894827393141	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.199188855271	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.189025323232	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.460921204739	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.239900757055	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.
0.0	0.0832563000191	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.252131314613	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.137776234868	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
1.0	0.959993649486	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.208656237603	And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition.
0.0	0.0686472105088	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.467646800428	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.0360426163692	And guess what?
0.0	0.594420045349	States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government.
0.0	0.0956699656135	I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House.
0.0	0.217712098652	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.220044653233	But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.
0.0	0.0176352802912	You get together.
0.0	0.407693565687	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.278462937446	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.194162983467	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.0576946888501	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.270615169403	We are already de-conflicting air space.
0.0	0.310260623098	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.188195454372	So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe.
0.0	0.116119281335	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.307751997385	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.137244661971	For her convenience.
0.0	0.22827889987	But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding.
0.0	0.439047470193	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.0755667568692	It's called the politics.
0.0	0.900750781337	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.197580296045	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
1.0	0.134761213359	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.148826239547	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.136033917874	... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do.
0.0	0.444934586959	Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, who said my plan for what we should do to reign in Wall Street was more comprehensive and better.
0.0	0.583614568979	And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.
0.0	0.282371851038	I've had had two town halls, one in Keene, one in Laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do.
0.0	0.0845835396159	That's the difference.
0.0	0.637269498777	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.150287316043	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.135320484006	And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China.
0.0	0.112162314984	And, we said no.
0.0	0.175652406823	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.0343641766933	We did a lot to help.
0.0	0.278287801685	We can have debt-free college in the United States.
0.0	0.0084318604434	Reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.111995055486	But we have a serious problem.
1.0	0.999988477174	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.86608691533	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...
0.0	0.119462665213	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.104618836843	Let me just -- let me just...
0.0	0.108472177249	I've gotten to do some incredible things.
0.0	0.178516163499	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.274787347511	This is a complicated issue.
0.0	0.0613718048924	You get a lot of them that are overrated.
0.0	0.190739293676	And some, I assume, are good people.
0.0	0.340612914979	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.306309455699	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.229188471128	No.
0.0	0.0667217683863	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.150537043002	It's affordable for everybody.
0.0	0.479389425122	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.128341802002	This is a terribly complicated issue.
0.0	0.263568724123	And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.0205726069816	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.271903502129	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
1.0	0.571901364787	According to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0448929000231	These are very, very real issues.
0.0	0.195471447721	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.0970843319351	So I've watched the politicians.
0.0	0.231127178255	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.097777830354	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.2087443748	Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.
0.0	0.028384803448	...Chris...
0.0	0.105633365405	I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen.
0.0	0.133789455557	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.178357593275	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.192373163345	We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is.
0.0	0.146390968102	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.149966048024	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.525757390745	I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
0.0	0.936712971529	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.244949796556	So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.
0.0	0.229188471128	But...
0.0	0.268087151586	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.406632683913	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
1.0	0.793268738686	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.314092827017	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.233463652929	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.169942158786	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.194253208015	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.254237811807	As president, I will support law enforcement and we'll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community.
0.0	0.40182678865	Two weeks later, the place was blown up.
0.0	0.0972752224894	I want to thank the people of Iowa for being so welcoming to me.
1.0	0.847360637103	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.236760587133	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.0770198838913	They serve in the military.
0.0	0.142548818885	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.348127901103	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.28144099176	Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.
0.0	0.441160089441	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
1.0	0.999999992416	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.564782014559	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.190632896162	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.267725826869	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.597519282197	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.0339881391256	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.289602774888	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
1.0	0.999992506609	In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.
0.0	0.338528261521	And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.
0.0	0.0245449256015	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.15335239971	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.229188471128	I have...
0.0	0.0351754366267	I will be ready.
1.0	0.987018804617	And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.
0.0	0.0586958540384	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.383947143754	And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.
0.0	0.31491420931	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.202548685311	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.252274830378	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.130446852628	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.226712361017	... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.00877403015949	I will...
0.0	0.421382520769	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.00584549700088	I feel like...
0.0	0.348901950358	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.438380454598	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.493561031017	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.527344970781	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.260415762625	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.0344628331781	Am I supposed to dislike them?
1.0	0.929520726454	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.0749058908469	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.450452678671	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
1.0	0.943564839469	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.218120519944	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.203532804111	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.444210245046	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.0604984430194	You don't hear it from anybody else.
0.0	0.0253041119737	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.916572941211	But you would index it -- you would index it to the median wage.
0.0	0.152237732477	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.123554772161	They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).
0.0	0.168769268244	But I would add this.
0.0	0.9136970581	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.696126593611	Illegal.
0.0	0.220133106309	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.
0.0	0.119444172032	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.312646387872	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.196092721699	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.688842365704	And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.
0.0	0.432682899499	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.988883944042	...10% flat rate...

0.0	0.278625856924	Are you not running?

0.0	0.0607227796967	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
0.0	0.115359648667	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.16827637542	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.

0.0	0.550163995664	Their business model is greed and fraud.
0.0	0.304572229663	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill.

0.0	0.118885849491	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.5	But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.
0.0	0.109622003523	Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process.
0.0	0.393120078112	And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues.
0.0	0.582013449747	We both made the identical promises.

1.0	0.82055335863	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.

0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.153315857096	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.226628368539	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.
0.0	0.233068835253	I...
0.0	0.0616871038762	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.261896338663	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.252977855716	My mother's dream -- and she died very young, but my mother's dream for her whole life was to be able to get out of that rent-controlled apartment and own a home of her own.
0.0	0.0529869540885	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.0339301200336	A step forward.

0.0	0.216074212253	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.16911514205	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.143709031022	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.257935207455	Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.

0.0	0.00854451379463	It feels different.
0.0	0.234984611823	But wait, I just want to say this Senator.
0.0	0.209779696092	ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.
0.0	0.20726862076	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.233525595731	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.104109668498	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.290764580145	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.216725595921	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.177363013103	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.110227467654	That's the big leagues.
0.0	0.343690244741	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.0347496047451	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.0842748250334	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.694490065009	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.222060993312	Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.
0.0	0.0348270234447	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.0298751292608	We have nothing.
0.0	0.128217739428	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.25699789362	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.0306009422577	So they put together this.
0.0	0.533075333864	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.

0.0	0.06757187403	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
0.0	0.567727530443	I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal.
1.0	0.960568015668	We borrow a million dollars a minute.

0.0	0.133821058479	I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.
0.0	0.157704995865	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.62143168529	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.333125989086	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.361711940822	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.
0.0	0.179445551129	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.12260016822	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.305961872591	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.142673950572	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.238519519791	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.
0.0	0.42057583351	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.195408544114	Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.
1.0	0.999999999148	Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.
0.0	0.12743908808	All of that together, we're going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.
0.0	0.229806720527	That was a terrible mistake.
0.0	0.409441214078	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.337371021309	Secretary Clinton is right.
0.0	0.329945052539	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
0.0	0.229188471128	No, you did.
0.0	0.207632025751	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.561668528639	She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.256050266976	And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them.
0.0	0.577950915695	We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.
0.0	0.0431464807441	Did she do a great job?
0.0	0.136467064954	It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
0.0	0.228817535699	Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris.
0.0	0.427860180415	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.309702461069	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.0993637106113	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.0755253933808	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.0444039724155	Fine, I'll take it.
0.0	0.199544356589	We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.
0.0	0.0226023670033	But here's what's going to happen:
0.0	0.240232989548	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.21784930922	Doctors are quitting.
0.0	0.338181514366	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.189665341928	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.112566785153	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.365593005854	Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?
0.0	0.192727979118	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.395445024746	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.43097994699	Of course the United States must lead.
0.0	0.272579012583	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.246898016719	We have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as General Dempsey said.
0.0	0.365020766521	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.245341128312	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.0899940450969	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.477487801375	I met recently with some members of the Chaldean Christian communities and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months.
0.0	0.481068710723	I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of State, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now.
0.0	0.406111857547	He's in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.0810920037591	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.197780950941	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.0959487314296	We're laughed at all over the world.
1.0	0.999983553647	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.315544050328	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.246634167079	Bottom line.
0.0	0.108950017201	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.512216241694	Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.
0.0	0.116990506773	Let me just say this...
0.0	0.180197771834	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.146521430083	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.149793865382	Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title.
0.0	0.447482532347	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.
0.0	0.114741556996	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.0695739608254	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.0929025356528	I would invite him, I actually would say.
0.0	0.719597567624	And I opposed it.
1.0	0.375327717336	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.223603818882	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.0354531998311	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.109443806333	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.0263020329305	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.430425254532	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...
0.0	0.168366405818	We actually took action to do these things and as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families.
0.0	0.865152196409	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
1.0	0.357838256834	And the overall message is that it doesn't result in job loss.
1.0	0.424888548194	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
1.0	0.986909929616	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.30214328772	So Ford will come back.
0.0	0.344724096974	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.229188471128	She did.
0.0	0.197046430805	We ought to send used equipment, right?
0.0	0.584972462189	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.0260139170888	But you know what?
0.0	0.121862024165	And we need the right people.
1.0	0.739574997059	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.0615390502947	What about hydroelectric power?
0.0	0.342193299981	And that's only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.
0.0	0.0349183729594	... Well, no, no.
0.0	0.157573675413	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.360328052389	Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.143358878849	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.384547295643	And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
0.0	0.171032814519	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.0756502473737	And I think this is an important question.
0.0	0.390206274997	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.0186310841917	And we can do it.
0.0	0.433571755928	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.108027258693	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.106937091668	He said, "You know, I make great product."
0.0	0.21396580776	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.0957289557832	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.452908035438	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.39475066829	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.153540559297	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.107005653964	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.189003225973	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.493742684254	And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring.
0.0	0.0311135380541	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.24735021524	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.119144046246	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.17442771606	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
0.0	0.0413956942102	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.475497551744	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.2185308304	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.0481033568237	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.136966791082	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.5394684443	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.0882854431189	Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough.
0.0	0.140644035952	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.136329656992	That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them.
0.0	0.286710883185	I think we need major reform in the military, making it more cost effective, but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us.
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.365047001215	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.143607941699	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.0633958615447	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.721010791344	I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.
0.0	0.666536730881	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.
0.0	0.0666710914706	But what -- I will tell you this.
0.0	0.051227690995	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.220821186805	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.299578947855	Yes, this one falls under the category of, I have actually done this.
0.0	0.363278444193	More importantly, I want kids in Burlington, Vermont, or Baltimore, Maryland, who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade, who don't have a lot of money, whose parents -- like my parents -- may never have gone to college.
0.0	0.0658869175106	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.303136172259	And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.362044634803	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.366553173053	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
0.0	0.107663127512	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
0.0	0.0442932436305	I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
0.0	0.0939688320545	But it cannot be an American fight.
0.0	0.209715133242	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.0740512519555	It's not crass.
0.0	0.573220980997	Yes, I apologize.
0.0	0.125572499625	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.0501233946742	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.696997476613	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.176216441576	It is enormously complicated.
0.0	0.268778306182	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.156237615226	I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path.
0.0	0.166710652516	I want immigration reform to pass.
1.0	0.231318626541	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.222419858744	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.109514648187	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.153071667403	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.321090682283	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.713847382356	I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains.
0.0	0.0303702278838	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.0324079776204	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.178005165433	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.491757255536	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.221406024119	Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS.
0.0	0.110005654376	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.201152908844	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.175211457056	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.197213720582	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.0927262710437	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.168695076963	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.681686216403	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.0252569493654	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.200247231614	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.268583879209	I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not.
0.0	0.476141723207	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.212434953979	As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that.
0.0	0.103848233739	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.083342530474	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.0409734180824	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.195116264772	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.015093928267	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.168360746007	But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.
0.0	0.239644458588	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.122542552551	That is the clear and present danger.
0.0	0.113857634442	But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that.
0.0	0.120809462654	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.653568404785	And he also had no trouble appointing an investment banker to be in charge of his consumer protection bureau when he was governor.
0.0	0.298650768003	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
1.0	0.635212104776	I did introduce legislation to reign in compensation.
0.0	0.449498832435	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.179758313609	And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country.
0.0	0.248917618367	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.
0.0	0.0181670331649	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.667771208113	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
0.0	0.199792345826	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
0.0	0.091605681589	Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
0.0	0.150637280968	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.0991566269074	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.21452906171	We have the U.N. Security Council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path.
0.0	0.154261040577	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.0604166856895	That is exactly...
0.0	0.133042603535	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.841515665343	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
1.0	0.0377875963135	They stole it.
0.0	0.163493010377	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.246199940318	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.162744109972	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.202008943498	They can provide resources.
0.0	0.110869586164	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.283334409748	We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.
0.0	0.130731808839	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.183596700087	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.224171780383	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.523958706058	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.256181423006	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.793068899382	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.121924972269	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.0338688801013	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.291956994583	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.460629740483	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.101962131924	All of you in Iowa, I need you to caucus for me.
0.0	0.0515944824396	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.264142849113	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.232833983686	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.369499165304	You bet they do.
0.0	0.0839605071688	It ain't complicated.
0.0	0.214897399228	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.104425591991	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
0.0	0.0595707060441	That's not the America that I think we should be.
1.0	0.891885178566	The Republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times.
0.0	0.0126539350718	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.133346283515	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.156126198656	All right, Nancy, I really wish you'd come back to me on this on this one, John...
0.0	0.561433241576	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.111902394281	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.144358805416	They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it."
0.0	0.267804952307	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.238026927975	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.279951618381	So, in terms of refugees, I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe, with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that, of course, we reach out.
0.0	0.37288574795	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.304043625578	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.0953336305698	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.160473368828	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.336045033684	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.590267857049	It means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana.
0.0	0.430798807922	Now that Russia has joined us in the Security Council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago, now I think we can have those conversations.
0.0	0.173271476974	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.818170073002	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.111065805384	He said, "I can't get it into China.
0.0	0.0525603394482	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.0864540927505	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.386767562644	We can triple the border patrol.
0.0	0.379620255899	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.471519894738	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.0470124384842	We all understand that.
0.0	0.140284763377	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.582783604337	People died, and only three people have been fired.
0.0	0.399505099806	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.259106450555	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.0884512104633	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.977691269812	We got $18 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.152168192789	We must keep America safe from this threat.
0.0	0.141274930687	By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job.
0.0	0.107718154401	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.246354832285	It cannot solely be America's fight.
0.0	0.129555690784	... but wait a minute...
0.0	0.0511273398879	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.168364408643	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.125782714887	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.198903076564	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
0.0	0.229188471128	...
0.0	0.252449395852	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
0.0	0.38484637104	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.523637160104	And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.
0.0	0.134189162495	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.0833458063734	We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.
0.0	0.725482855373	Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor.
0.0	0.357901259851	Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country -- we would never build in an ocean.
0.0	0.229188471128	How?
0.0	0.0479405086435	I think we're missing the point here.
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.159582312532	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.0963108208882	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.0739969444405	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.353208586497	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.317844931947	And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.
0.0	0.759987220852	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.438338489785	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
1.0	0.986698069463	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.204168623786	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.486513803812	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.244055031013	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.0333280129808	Look at my family.
0.0	0.0384707097345	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.472911974409	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.182504386656	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.0922025181379	They were wrong.
0.0	0.92837887288	We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.
0.0	0.0403897177574	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.0507243894017	Our president doesn't have a clue.
0.0	0.406029287521	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.255865750166	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.11779476036	... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message.
0.0	0.0358777949883	We must anticipate these threats before they happen.
0.0	0.188647385525	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.688876180478	My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.
0.0	0.51355052052	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.0261453526645	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.775673397722	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.466049678036	So I believe that over the next few years, not tomorrow, but over the next few years, we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.229188471128	But Megyn...
1.0	0.995112818115	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.825045352971	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.979898393252	$5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.197729211951	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.363549832398	People were shocked, Trump got it.
0.0	0.43236318566	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.153567215679	Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.
0.0	0.18171328414	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.597050800817	You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.
0.0	0.270615152211	Got to be on the floor of the Senate.
0.0	0.0942788160586	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
1.0	0.908786095986	I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.
0.0	0.278192833165	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.253969280934	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.0613045983611	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.251131080255	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.527609815638	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.260000429031	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.426821198891	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.116662028007	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.11410700159	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.563251044307	It's campaign -- a corrupt campaign finance system.
0.0	0.0167534638447	Yeah.
0.0	0.46356074865	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.306767866319	And in 19 -- and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said -- and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever.
0.0	0.299095667738	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.296229252487	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.

0.0	0.369787694724	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.149096091047	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.0651541269827	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.112286190226	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.378515520585	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.229188471128	But...
0.0	0.160743977107	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
0.0	0.0792240922096	Bret, we're just starting.
0.0	0.0439024072127	They're terrified by the saber rattling.
1.0	0.644728840557	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.152329720521	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.28949917634	I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up.
0.0	0.334554002651	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.124165468451	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.208613820907	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.268100739795	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.5	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.48427087178	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.208537975994	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.355108697421	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.448826249813	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.461882829533	That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.

0.0	0.229188471128	It is.
0.0	0.0808510185366	The Secretary's obviously right.
0.0	0.051196225343	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.25644608337	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.428257380478	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.0745030072895	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.0970186159278	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.3605980094	I made it the old-fashioned way.
0.0	0.10610774501	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.113082595852	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.
0.0	0.0195618499679	I think what is...
0.0	0.347097299552	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.335957729906	We can in fact create jobs and provide job security.
0.0	0.075092963859	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.161980443643	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.118800281759	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.22364451957	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.229188471128	...
0.0	0.0360426163692	And guess what?
0.0	0.0254334027553	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.18446655443	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.118612390726	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.25797592663	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.26737454954	Again, Americans murdered.

0.0	0.00976672797547	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.243505754075	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.336928951097	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
1.0	0.959112730686	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.246543600526	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.258137416952	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.16669816618	And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.410665624194	We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up.
0.0	0.241675744135	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.251571471894	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.16423928902	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.229188471128	No.
0.0	0.00877403015949	They will not.
0.0	0.961073618094	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.259253943128	He said, "we have the military in the streets right now.
0.0	0.33327072029	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.35997590023	You can go to opensecrets.org and check that.
0.0	0.575204581496	Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.
0.0	0.371216163786	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.365219771497	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.268371224769	So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.
0.0	0.130199074512	But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble.
0.0	0.30700572978	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.349158214979	We have more people in jail today than any other country on earth.
0.0	0.266986630414	Now, I understand that this is very difficult.
0.0	0.877543241588	Trillions of dollars have gone from the middle class and working families to the top one-tenth of one percent who have doubled the percentage of wealth they now own.
0.0	0.140284763377	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.0353536925144	... an agreement with the...
1.0	0.989763035553	This small country has welcomed in many refugees.
0.0	0.432473575678	And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals -- the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
0.0	0.0987813831502	Let me say this.
0.0	0.464484085861	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.201911915807	The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.
0.0	0.0718246462404	... (inaudible) opening statement.
0.0	0.664459254964	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.330080708579	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.930701537746	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.129795687981	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.0368000283095	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.301157867279	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.0487384165043	No problem.
0.0	0.251970316597	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.711681117744	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
1.0	0.702272220306	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.14640947165	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.00972652482158	Talk about what?
0.0	0.159652939437	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.432593442115	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.101712872717	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
0.0	0.0625336973568	We can build the fence.
0.0	0.0260139170888	So you know what?
0.0	0.361693894783	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.532915135068	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.294473394808	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.197427298283	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.0996962798478	And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
0.0	0.0336788054583	My point is this.
0.0	0.528157579159	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.605320379818	We expand Medicare to all people.
0.0	0.181511354658	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.289403905924	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.268995060708	Let's reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.0892147872054	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.729792304917	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.211327660542	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
1.0	0.999996743513	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
1.0	0.877388848709	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.0151369444421	The mentally ill?
0.0	0.0840852317	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.128197713642	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.303487392471	I believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation.
0.0	0.185173093122	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.
0.0	0.117303910434	We now finally are where we need to be.
0.0	0.623882974577	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.168016682548	So I would say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.0791698505403	We got nothing but problems.
0.0	0.319952433599	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.327777588341	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.099377655142	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.321523411042	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.0892367057809	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.349398972489	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.62202777932	I am proud that I was the first member of Congress to take Americans over the Canadian border to buy breast cancer drugs for one-tenth the price they were paying in the United States.
0.0	0.144107434848	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.5	And also -- also, what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health care outcomes are not necessarily that good.
0.0	0.717204788566	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
0.0	0.747285555315	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.302335432279	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.
0.0	0.308066054799	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.319737586656	The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
0.0	0.336593383986	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.826349061334	Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico.
0.0	0.332666157221	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.30448728247	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.
0.0	0.329905759834	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.137080825031	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.583480125269	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.5	And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity.
0.0	0.225261959463	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.150434123058	If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs.
0.0	0.886823507088	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.237607607034	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.201292710989	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.07939540951	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.306872809228	We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.
0.0	0.270734849159	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.300395351899	In addition to that...
0.0	0.627088619213	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.337832034411	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
1.0	0.350185285002	We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.00998390992901	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.311904235957	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.223771473317	I would like to see it updated.
0.0	0.213668526959	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.0186310841917	You can have him.
0.0	0.839068712795	You should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition.
0.0	0.396206486615	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.864026004527	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.606248294777	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.185728401222	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.0689250378212	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.249858497157	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.0263020329305	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.320613538187	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.124316748999	And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?
0.0	0.0724305666866	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.520153144232	If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.
0.0	0.0452829860638	Good evening.
0.0	0.13931093083	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.458478822619	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.218788754348	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.406966478576	You cannot grant amnesty.
0.0	0.30573614864	Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare?
0.0	0.0803778139392	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.0259090587868	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.124701138627	Well, let me tell you this.
1.0	0.999983424826	So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education.
0.0	0.110171978497	And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.
0.0	0.0195618499679	Kathie, I think -- Kathie the...
0.0	0.148242883436	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.269506162537	That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities.
0.0	0.860939160622	Fifty-one percent of high school African-American graduates are unemployed or underemployed.
0.0	0.229188471128	That is...
0.0	0.263053554695	None of that information was looked at.
0.0	0.0583107466564	Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.
1.0	0.981482850906	I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians.

0.0	0.146988692916	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.

0.0	0.13635901408	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.132945182414	And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem.
0.0	0.728551089513	For example, it is outrageous that we don't have an opportunity for Medicare to negotiate for lower prices.

0.0	0.0497447796711	It is not tough talk.

0.0	0.0245326497505	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.690858798962	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.11748489223	We're rebuilding many countries.
0.0	0.393790907594	So that it will not be a federal crime.

0.0	0.20226668984	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.194640010833	And they don't know -- "Are you running?

0.0	0.215681390369	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.20708007068	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.139005671912	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.169395422853	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.359790438769	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.00300288174206	Look--
0.0	0.483075593521	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.453572783774	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.395709256973	It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.
0.0	0.350319388234	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.102581658426	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.33458179286	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.093299700074	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
0.0	0.349018030823	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
0.0	0.140910908261	And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.
0.0	0.148888201197	Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging.
0.0	0.256616308223	Sit down with people like John Mccain.
0.0	0.52974012725	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.

0.0	0.00627165919814	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.0311845793799	Right.
0.0	0.306630501825	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...
0.0	0.0954014893393	I've done it.
0.0	0.124595422697	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.251854915813	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.061586935229	I'm the only person...
0.0	0.441583697768	So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
0.0	0.134701996728	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
1.0	0.64196876417	Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.
0.0	0.215991830624	And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.
0.0	0.26717671628	All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.
0.0	0.361193706512	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.16179988676	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.159264307424	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.405949484059	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.646234691004	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.0923737993735	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.
0.0	0.1045426055	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.605505712451	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.446093428491	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.801510448189	She was naturalized.
1.0	0.999981983935	They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.
0.0	0.794793076915	You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.373595997909	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.0576868657119	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.946750774226	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.0740994782257	I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination.
0.0	0.0545699561354	So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do.
0.0	0.381102727729	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.0311845793799	All right.
0.0	0.0545004055647	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.737820182994	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.127958996846	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.853005116811	Bill.
0.0	0.397525226481	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.580586667647	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.323153394242	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.110911854389	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.0543905577617	That is the issue.
0.0	0.0755029770848	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.61199713443	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.491013160675	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.842952895112	So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.
0.0	0.221402774808	And I have to tell you, I would not want -- if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my health care.
0.0	0.0389973810335	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.241624689331	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.258112521761	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.184323847438	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.397123357211	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.161919776833	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.358599601383	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.328352108288	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.0829612952537	But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.
0.0	0.284472248354	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.43591236791	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.199241825324	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.0653300682277	All of these are very difficult issues.
0.0	0.16192304152	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.543028491004	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
0.0	0.677701761662	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.278133331088	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.253186776833	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.125569478116	We don't have victories anymore.
0.0	0.0849227010989	Excuse me, no.

0.0	0.0508692755662	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.141901908802	The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.

0.0	0.754017764043	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.

0.0	0.340627542615	But I went further than that.
0.0	0.177689543149	We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.
0.0	0.208402701155	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.161441955281	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.010626303254	You're welcome.
0.0	0.351504181942	As Americans, we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet, but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies, to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability.
1.0	0.259117477389	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.231122595745	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.0967244318643	We've got the consensus, what we're lacking is political leadership...

0.0	0.514839589581	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.0593888771327	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.230901842103	And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears.

0.0	0.174654012802	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.335585794344	You have all of these disastrous airports.
0.0	0.046108675269	Because we don't want them in and out -- we don't want them in and out of the prisons.
0.0	0.14012409309	But states need to do more as well.

0.0	0.154261040577	Absolutely.
0.0	0.369397311305	So, yes, this has developed.
0.0	0.41639920279	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.621366744905	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.283746068525	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?

0.0	0.329716054787	We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party.
0.0	0.0367183909625	So should the UK, so should France.

0.0	0.138090059378	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.214756695737	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.117591921504	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.205114870746	And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that.
0.0	0.0286007902113	He's an entertaining guy.
0.0	0.229188471128	No.

1.0	0.273900046272	A lot of people up there can't get jobs.
0.0	0.0585956292997	So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there.
0.0	0.911246887045	Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.
0.0	0.124236135519	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.0640218053112	I think it's a two-pronged issue.
0.0	0.315910306241	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.417739389419	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?

0.0	0.206572601344	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.126531965664	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.306341280638	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.0763034928645	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.289540266522	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.13520170718	It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino.
0.0	0.337258338588	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
1.0	0.999994651352	The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation.
0.0	0.208801596383	I've faced it.
0.0	0.392820662325	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.

0.0	0.0739502626584	May I respond?
0.0	0.278628953006	We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.
0.0	0.873449512867	Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent.

0.0	0.0562096504679	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.306851714205	That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive.
0.0	0.191797578814	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.44315095924	We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be -- we ought to send our surplus.
0.0	0.713052017406	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
0.0	0.721669026321	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.149335395886	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.
0.0	0.0311845793799	All right.
1.0	0.86586499567	And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent.
0.0	0.0603409614154	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.41381966013	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.0245906265315	It never happens.
0.0	0.174035466572	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.

0.0	0.289869997276	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.16160613359	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.
0.0	0.279497832445	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.354917095101	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.134998811751	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.421668362693	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.110705865615	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.0380991055625	We don't want to be Sweden.

0.0	0.156639515185	In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston.
0.0	0.369316179815	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.73297711765	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.229188471128	So what do we do?
0.0	0.873563810181	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.417247869698	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.377773129762	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.54171216258	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.942714984361	And remember the $5 billion Web site?
0.0	0.161513939267	He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims -- all Shia Muslims on the planet.
0.0	0.111876840104	Man (ph), their mother's here as well.
0.0	0.180167394905	We have tremendous people.
0.0	0.947899593296	Real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years.
0.0	0.080993842636	That is an egregious act.
0.0	0.68538301587	I led the effort, unfortunately unsuccessfully, against deregulation because I knew when you merge large insurance companies and investment banks and commercial banks it was not going to be good.
0.0	0.169315577915	Many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed.
0.0	0.281023465578	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.286781097844	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.899071473951	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.297912433843	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.279507916254	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.222335094502	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.52102160164	But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired.
0.0	0.286754562374	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.421201266478	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.0514922791764	I gotta do it, Dad.
0.0	0.528454575232	Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force.
0.0	0.100094305398	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.
0.0	0.0411623726632	They don't like that.
0.0	0.676005827902	But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it.
0.0	0.150956966068	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.229188471128	So...
0.0	0.147918491165	What our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as Americans.
0.0	0.403466356575	It's a country in which people choose to buy guns.
0.0	0.0487384165043	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.126411924354	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.549600286393	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.0936128176301	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.271509645418	And, also, acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration, and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners.
0.0	0.895022057425	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.0311305629669	I hate to hear it."
0.0	0.176239087241	Lehman Brothers was not a big bank.
0.0	0.404880141376	For a start, they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes.
0.0	0.179913393156	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.159100259215	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.312290783962	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.223389339889	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.607005177227	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.200212447146	Yes.
0.0	0.336154838484	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.331639728021	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.340681933698	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.229188471128	...
0.0	0.04807816335	We need -- we need somebody -- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.
0.0	0.938697821229	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.0822133211082	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.182007753858	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.471079898243	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.632357676126	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.515946677337	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.401606137945	We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt.
0.0	0.308712463463	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.0475161934918	I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country.
0.0	0.258304441587	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
0.0	0.172216854911	We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground.
0.0	0.0889836279566	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.149549627303	Well, we did have a plan, and I think it's fair to say that of all of the Arab leaders, Gaddafi probably had more blood on his hands of Americans than anybody else.
0.0	0.41898755968	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.473370209631	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.173896084728	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.120673286822	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.290843015014	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.0750136728394	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.117427503045	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.300049355627	Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.
0.0	0.18374572091	Well, I would just repeat that.
1.0	0.944393609128	That billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers.
0.0	0.143530007708	So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.
0.0	0.138394681509	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.785746716797	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.809070633933	I also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down.
0.0	0.477689365163	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.
0.0	0.00302303273442	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.323115709135	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.0685448813984	And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.
0.0	0.581878499917	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.194559168444	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.0502824597382	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.367083481924	We used to have victories, but we don't have them.
0.0	0.203530375666	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.299236648023	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.524502545763	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
1.0	0.999997383832	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.0713913172922	It sounds crass.
0.0	0.592877969101	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.579878238007	Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.
0.0	0.535493522446	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.903195074139	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.449924117281	If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune.
0.0	0.250285260236	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.540602078575	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.451500542971	Paul Volcker, one of the leading lights of trying to reign in the excesses, has also said he does not support reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.32987670503	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
1.0	0.995659421616	And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.
0.0	0.362705303089	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.182391113833	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.166495951748	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.071738019058	We have -- I don't know that there's any disagreement here...
0.0	0.0100313201588	We need a doer, not a talker.
1.0	0.999999985918	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.2322324569	But those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort.
0.0	0.0315292675917	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.145171149801	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.12875447684	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.108751168618	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.164780122604	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.657593328672	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.260636736323	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.546421288769	Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
0.0	0.0795553735	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.427190897449	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.455697879415	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
1.0	0.922562911473	She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.
0.0	0.178343484213	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.527400016399	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.172987456034	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.629881583796	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.492513653036	I have a comprehensive, tough plan.
0.0	0.232583458143	We overcame the NRA's objections.
0.0	0.413431695235	I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks.
0.0	0.608465653524	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.27461045429	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.047928040327	He can't have it both ways.
0.0	0.222313373841	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.221743452652	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.431866974966	I think it's fair to say that Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America, but the issue is...
0.0	0.0124325298874	Creativity.
0.0	0.269910567992	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.0961328433258	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.0806381022351	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.168206868188	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
1.0	0.14104283253	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.0697026218234	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.170408792271	... we will secure the border...
1.0	0.999999386226	Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education.
0.0	0.261199629905	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.401636584254	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.41851936227	Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, "Rand, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.251342820548	We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended.
0.0	0.0994471174829	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.185178883907	Starting with our children and moving forward.
0.0	0.180849864799	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.915972678167	I released 34 years of tax returns...
0.0	0.417709483819	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.134993323964	I do not believe in unilateral American action.
0.0	0.523794929094	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.548817428411	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.0755710329956	Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.
1.0	0.81113548268	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.205891077479	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
0.0	0.56854980064	But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
0.0	0.184522684063	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.0342042401677	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.0243349382112	That's really nice.
0.0	0.10538999427	... and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.741464141903	We were the first to pass a minimum wage.
0.0	0.166166479588	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.234865033439	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.68991311718	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.357816265115	I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.
0.0	0.273460133788	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.399149505471	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
1.0	0.367525853206	Unfortunately, Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, set about decimating it.
0.0	0.579087589634	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.230297721925	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.0126539350718	No, they shouldn't.
0.0	0.354009887496	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.81402126074	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.304671530723	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.205778469429	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.104199060675	They're killing us.
0.0	0.590483043936	You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization.
0.0	0.132190491754	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
1.0	0.137856539529	They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us.
0.0	0.420714441155	I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done.
0.0	0.142223912777	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.0350120986665	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.0260139170888	And you know what?
0.0	0.267189130424	We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.
0.0	0.344640770399	They are our first line of defense.
0.0	0.168729720462	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.06554059079	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.0964491019958	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.584799064402	And we've got to do more on equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.00733862019759	Thank you.
0.0	0.20889623458	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.538098101345	I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.
