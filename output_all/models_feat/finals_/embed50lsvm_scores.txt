0.0	0.422909395044	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.43722241741	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.257507911807	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.406231738093	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.290808042002	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.3647558744	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
1.0	0.40966539496	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.268517341643	I think we all support it.
0.0	0.447633698471	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.108721029529	I do.
0.0	0.344860882677	There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out.
0.0	0.343651899573	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.
0.0	0.430703557442	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.309307889151	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.47857872336	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.296061983365	We've got to build a coalition abroad.
0.0	0.423246179487	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
0.0	0.294692608074	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.478773314434	He was on the board.
0.0	0.210140226014	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.246084287503	DICKERSON: A question from Kathie Obradovich.
0.0	0.360160208174	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.323068493383	... against Islam -- radical Islam -- if you're not for border security.
0.0	0.38881217269	We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation.
0.0	0.464854330868	The simple fact is, we all have a record.
0.0	0.435868565468	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.
0.0	0.384432122546	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.
0.0	0.254012753003	I know how hard it is to build coalitions.
0.0	0.419002508984	Here's my promise-- Wall Street representatives will not be in my cabinet.
0.0	0.354423564085	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.43816409444	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.230610371831	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.428152061773	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
1.0	0.747132680482	They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
0.0	0.57709178868	We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels.
0.0	0.336574376783	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.299628360466	Marco can change his mind.
1.0	0.610678616959	Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.
0.0	0.133440261022	That's not right.
0.0	0.306028844125	But Obamacare kicks in in 2016.
0.0	0.477075692795	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.347829467649	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.430686950201	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.239346380114	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.193360878861	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.32388126535	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.338398836456	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.330027527969	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.369429280732	They would never be hired again.
0.0	0.448665542875	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.574629184003	And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to.
0.0	0.168387277451	You're certainly not very good.
0.0	0.500049190773	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.27223100405	And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous.
0.0	0.354715275591	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.450850314651	And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.
0.0	0.380164604704	And let me, by the way, take this moment to congratulate Hillary Clinton, who I thought not only did an outstanding job as our first lady, but redefined what that role could be.
0.0	0.285280026546	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.418710329972	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.359242913151	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.263118217246	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.327528769382	Let's do more -- let's do more than reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.360448604485	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.369234240111	I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
0.0	0.387428226735	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
0.0	0.262573684848	If I was president, I'd say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.320596676539	Given the fact that she's a lot smarter than me, yes, she would.
0.0	0.16002354032	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.33318744592	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.396382119263	That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
0.0	0.38097643907	You've got to be on top of it.
0.0	0.505738078276	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.320752239487	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.279064072511	Ever.
0.0	0.296313081493	Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.
0.0	0.366135249585	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.431659655299	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.262055606812	Yes, exactly, exactly.
0.0	0.35425727727	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.335387584493	So ladies and gentlemen...I am officially running...... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.
0.0	0.197512712074	Excuse me.
0.0	0.420972934634	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.311618947932	It's not about Donald Trump.
0.0	0.577755413645	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.240129831453	Jared (ph), Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family.
0.0	0.411500440546	The Turks are being threatened.
0.0	0.462212663077	You do the arithmetic.
1.0	0.326861537923	They're bringing crime.
0.0	0.420132307446	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.427115738771	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
0.0	0.355010080304	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.16237536626	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.17886675704	Here's what I believe.
0.0	0.387943829476	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.35529599676	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.212309523413	He does great.
0.0	0.264443657057	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
0.0	0.617379106656	It costs me $3.
0.0	0.449912791502	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.497804375331	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.452439895525	And together we make it possible for a new generation of young people to refinance their debt and not come out with debt in the future.
0.0	0.39596241452	When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war.
0.0	0.262414382499	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.471035050647	Clearly the best piece of veterans' legislation brought forth in decades.
0.0	0.424050429349	They're not supporting our law enforcement officers, it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.385136960067	As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.
0.0	0.264910878964	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.138539930265	I really am.
0.0	0.108721029529	Why?
0.0	0.428451011035	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.293273577582	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.39111289271	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.332996517338	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.385224301354	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.455388414518	This is what's made our nation so special.
0.0	0.320775434451	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.464227681302	He's actually a negative force.
0.0	0.412181905447	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.466770189427	We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001.
0.0	0.541350246237	But, bottom line is this is the year 2015.
0.0	0.346701503537	It's not a bestseller.
0.0	0.405746988137	Check it out.
0.0	0.553350846544	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
0.0	0.411924149921	I have formed them.
0.0	0.394645381357	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.3610366557	So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.
0.0	0.372110726109	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.310434444953	Because we need money.
0.0	0.227498311965	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.371931230902	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.219541494548	We're dying.
0.0	0.325493989994	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.384496206573	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
1.0	0.452241612429	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.429704158091	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.33390547222	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.32519674175	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.377566200742	The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.
1.0	0.42869470935	When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.328966039289	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.48818014648	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
1.0	0.789080061021	And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.
0.0	0.27293197347	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.295569252698	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.359943828754	But I'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya, you would be looking at Syria.
0.0	0.414963574107	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.470703056346	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.312865419343	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.300494221444	We need sound money.
0.0	0.332236568963	You have a bigger problem with China.
0.0	0.441835286706	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.413953679682	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
0.0	0.384472571368	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.324227658143	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.557410261192	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.345600022125	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.49080583759	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
0.0	0.291512286254	I will work my heart out.
0.0	0.269335019831	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.495931758159	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.162427589991	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.33780611516	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.356787153709	You have a problem with ISIS.
0.0	0.440164279013	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.270957355098	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.404689453514	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.263953907761	Let's have a Democratic Syria.
0.0	0.158549372405	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.337024544277	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
1.0	0.601449186334	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.563815639544	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.265867401724	You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well.
0.0	0.210950849739	I think any parent would be so proud of them.
0.0	0.270478789626	They are not our friend, believe me.
0.0	0.495798163753	Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.
1.0	0.472572769185	And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
0.0	0.202405283674	We're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.411663737235	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.371561046889	I was for legalization.
0.0	0.235190981362	That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.
0.0	0.330735536704	And here's the problem in this country right now.
0.0	0.339010160879	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.250054984064	Now, this is getting to be fun.
0.0	0.175740366379	You just want to...
0.0	0.3437964864	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.
0.0	0.313777661182	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.479581503261	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.295475374227	They were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.378140013608	And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.
0.0	0.268517341643	I think we all support that.
0.0	0.445010210681	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.301287584194	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.

0.0	0.453513909736	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.366643489419	Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone.
0.0	0.406467763554	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.

0.0	0.393613502267	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.383997359115	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.311866045969	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.321289574273	We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.
0.0	0.126564408081	Yes.
0.0	0.397589134632	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
1.0	0.78878967041	One candidate said, you know what, I don't think it's a great idea that we sell automatic weapons in this country that are used by the military to kill people very rapidly.
0.0	0.308679819594	Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
0.0	0.397140006331	It's not just Wall Street.
0.0	0.395511746756	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.430268537356	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
1.0	0.86794286795	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.474784616246	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.310637353796	I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it.
0.0	0.326410119057	So we need people -- I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.365055701634	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.384033710985	I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.380700113623	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.38087994973	We need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table.
0.0	0.34862379287	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.344908644755	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.324802178428	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.
0.0	0.289080136629	Look what they did in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.448192707236	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.256099799868	That's what our parents and grandparents always did.
0.0	0.427835863273	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.317367530891	Now, you'd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me?
1.0	0.827462307166	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.402716289041	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.396986542708	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.465192120538	You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet...
0.0	0.346240499547	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.425013233776	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
1.0	0.271126528716	We owe Japan more than that.

0.0	0.588830053806	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.244760777217	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.378519015318	So, what we want to do is to say, look, we have 11 million people who have been here, many of them for decades.
0.0	0.451456097032	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.16476884499	We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
0.0	0.421341318867	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.

0.0	0.396360245244	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.37787340481	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.278738753412	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.278549722467	I think it's important we put this in historic context.
0.0	0.240427207636	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.396677283644	The list goes on because the differences are so stark.
0.0	0.284070725904	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.381289115118	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.301311664822	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.382855184831	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.481374266559	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.173317259448	That's what should be done.
0.0	0.343560174028	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.686424936518	Of course not.
1.0	0.487810033265	He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage, and what its effects are.
0.0	0.42080939786	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.495541898518	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.536283683844	Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.
0.0	0.3014211824	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.313801214123	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.177061198254	I do not think it would come to that.
0.0	0.522299279095	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.305084291865	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.397931005126	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.32388296147	We can't.
0.0	0.460905930645	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.401650021202	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.311404617572	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.359758617381	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.459853440375	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
0.0	0.334536340665	Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home.
0.0	0.211345498328	But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up.
0.0	0.361402215549	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.244409682572	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.430934172583	So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.
0.0	0.329654349722	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.280983705203	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.415904989443	But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.406755056431	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.632594447009	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.357770993801	If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country.
0.0	0.432879155609	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
1.0	0.483541513059	You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small.
0.0	0.336823422609	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.350308219788	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.293885099076	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.37517926673	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.317267184052	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.314634927006	I don't care.
0.0	0.470369265395	I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here.
0.0	0.280157569274	The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans.
0.0	0.467613809748	If we are not successful, if we continue the same old, same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big-money interests, nothing changes.
0.0	0.310580733628	He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots.
0.0	0.189782384844	I love the Saudis.

0.0	0.380951297626	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.496502025989	If the United States does not lead, there is not another leader.
0.0	0.149089680636	That I can tell you.
0.0	0.108721029529	It was.
0.0	0.412183697329	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.421884599529	I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
0.0	0.328909489568	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.485896974808	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.426466083555	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.312238064963	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.390356374342	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.428598518678	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.108721029529	How do we do it?"
0.0	0.437195697424	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.382211771712	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.161496202035	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.439617104521	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.
0.0	0.379002795914	But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector.
0.0	0.293583214845	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.326739481094	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.375803961324	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.422227439765	I beat China all the time.
0.0	0.268543128013	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.478107595923	I am not the candidate of Wall Street...

0.0	0.429706795213	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.301680729086	If he'd like to play, that's fine.
0.0	0.284495571247	Please go to hillaryclinton.com and be part of making this country what we know it can and should be.
0.0	0.41258507952	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.388169133414	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.233072212673	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.427387400703	We are a better country than this.
0.0	0.359639100206	But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.
0.0	0.403826662565	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.330872501925	We haven't.
0.0	0.358504378681	So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
0.0	0.454735239478	I was not the secretary of state...
0.0	0.291758830229	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.258860023729	Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, "Sorry, fellas.
0.0	0.267698127805	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.397462710661	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.478145642097	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.326228235778	I've laid out...

0.0	0.321177301942	Afghanistan is a mess.
0.0	0.274289362453	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.381796824123	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.385581727437	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.
1.0	0.733617055544	In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship.
0.0	0.464971346047	Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.
0.0	0.0942409610085	And you know what?
0.0	0.149089680636	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.429861047186	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.524700443319	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.433636815001	Give Bernie Sanders credit.

0.0	0.437008061194	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.316998293555	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.322216553274	That's my view.
0.0	0.326837356254	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.108721029529	And here's why.
0.0	0.432997200753	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.317971053985	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.
0.0	0.336881147823	Kevin, if I could just jump in.
0.0	0.410901715422	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.402422645546	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.424443162074	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.50896273271	My daughters went to college on a mountain of bills.
0.0	0.328647069251	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.402205303153	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.339935245024	And, here's what she said to the American people.
0.0	0.313219662356	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.345673164921	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
0.0	0.49673731502	Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions?
0.0	0.530397070244	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.239386475779	We need more principle.
0.0	0.462343393949	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.337630587845	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.422320291069	When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up.
0.0	0.396255322642	And the world, no doubt is a better place without him.
0.0	0.271838944751	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.60946142691	Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.
0.0	0.202405283674	And we're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.317999999095	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.521939850362	I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.
0.0	0.435451225808	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.412358606423	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.429028223259	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.338756059253	It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible.
0.0	0.419273703701	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.108721029529	Not at all.
0.0	0.291031394887	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.429154483834	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.435144825726	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.400447801545	So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.

0.0	0.17886675704	Believe me.

0.0	0.240069611568	Whoever heard of this?
0.0	0.597322650736	We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government.

0.0	0.363937041384	I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.

0.0	0.359382539987	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.346311217823	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.359126932236	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.491269143068	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.355110543091	As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.

0.0	0.330318224072	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.302543699997	Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said.
0.0	0.437981936682	They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea.
0.0	0.206596491741	That is absolutely not right.

0.0	0.293112627304	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?

0.0	0.232019461053	I'll keep -- I'll keep heading in that direction, believe me.
0.0	0.396118998479	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.388515950309	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.472362324029	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.352067586996	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.318481510935	But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says.
1.0	0.490393368336	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.493304302989	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.423336015508	I am on the committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.394040957946	It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.
0.0	0.457490354967	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.237318385482	She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship.
0.0	0.357597942985	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.374872681958	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.518924454512	We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally.
0.0	0.420125486274	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.415583987369	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.245807757549	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.353509597519	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.373541142591	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.425584768574	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.295933191172	Everybody thought the deal was dead.
0.0	0.335752708694	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.342075913621	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.435826511376	And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
0.0	0.403006293442	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.447622043077	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.424775639315	It's a divided country on guns.
0.0	0.547552747977	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.573589643374	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.412775639122	The Libyans turned out for one of the most successful, fairest elections that any Arab country has had.
0.0	0.375383318591	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.328139608322	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.225308457245	I don't want it."
0.0	0.160667167164	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.453805731532	Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.272094536384	He's very smooth.
0.0	0.379663875383	That is abundantly clear.
0.0	0.425853057289	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.359774260709	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.389172757711	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.386807882223	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.412791156819	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.413682736229	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.314564424275	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.41705551759	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.606820066641	We defended the highest median income in the country.
0.0	0.508149722	And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.
0.0	0.406198549584	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.373005487221	Martha -- I would just repeat that --
0.0	0.340894109855	We need new leadership.
0.0	0.340933809526	I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to -- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.
0.0	0.401124112996	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.313330928678	It is a step forward.
0.0	0.108721029529	No their not.
0.0	0.41177471782	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.32014723994	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.378766886631	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.477624644011	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.367833847505	Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day.
0.0	0.408519417685	Every (inaudible) Democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rosa DeLauro, got ears (ph) to legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave.
0.0	0.51307868417	He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter.
0.0	0.401618361136	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.297292929248	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.457611779844	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.437474625424	There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.
0.0	0.464712935754	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.359379440015	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.194153249321	I kind of miss him.
0.0	0.369462936381	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.23391878256	Can I -- can I -- I just...
0.0	0.583376051112	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.412976299529	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.330481946672	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.326021473491	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.393534690249	The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...
0.0	0.447079388446	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.424866395233	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.454035133407	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.305490903995	I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.
1.0	0.605962837931	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.216799807893	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.33810217989	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.413371867382	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.375075023413	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.515868291108	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.323567710473	He said, "Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."
0.0	0.445850048468	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.
0.0	0.260875703041	And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
0.0	0.449208510496	As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country.
0.0	0.33682909047	Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond...
0.0	0.328215019659	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.226423096454	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.276264349103	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.411734030936	But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it.
0.0	0.37519919263	Chris I was mentioned in that question.
0.0	0.346539268557	The people aren't dumb.

0.0	0.199689011603	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.396870741445	Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting...
0.0	0.332474800601	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.353574466511	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.224961532282	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.

0.0	0.293447607206	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.406910287497	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.

0.0	0.413949036766	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.229884617819	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.227616335917	Oh, yes there is.
0.0	0.569713218519	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.409394352921	Planned Parenthood will be defunded.
0.0	0.3718830154	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.34094134818	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.238014713159	We were wrong.
0.0	0.504107021316	I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.328931914065	Yes, they control them.
0.0	0.705140680388	You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent.
0.0	0.417806832972	And when he moved on his own people, threatening a massacre, genocide, the Europeans and the Arabs, our allies and partners, did ask for American help and we provided it.
0.0	0.490201009724	More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows.
0.0	0.390276181473	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.347199064471	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.506540747369	They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?
0.0	0.244931293799	Let me...
0.0	0.411044695695	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.452260942597	This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.404774528587	In all due respect...
0.0	0.492523615853	But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
0.0	0.293774548359	But actually I am.
0.0	0.395656588962	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
1.0	0.757742871925	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.379428556533	Divide that out.
0.0	0.492019428138	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.369157718695	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.605895963772	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.430880429635	The bill would involve legalization.
0.0	0.45535443569	Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.
0.0	0.471111050627	So it was not against ISIS, it was against -- it was against Assad.
0.0	0.560553025968	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.226424061131	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.405003247667	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.437346080475	They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.
0.0	0.508251237366	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.418039982431	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.239754451146	So I don't think...
0.0	0.483094399032	First priority, destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.352059561759	I'll advertise my Web site as well.
0.0	0.402447308502	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.316217263545	Please become part of the political revolution.
0.0	0.373937493883	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.44804551672	So it's unfair to say in total...
0.0	0.202733090662	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.28812604112	And I hear their speeches.
0.0	0.386132263598	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.264984151055	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.2483808783	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.427526336496	You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?
0.0	0.133440261022	That's right.
0.0	0.371193093098	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.344772639541	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.391723576035	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.331339547408	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.41205438259	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.415561213815	... and I think -- you know, Governor -- Jeb, you -- the attack that -- the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS.
0.0	0.252943766529	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
0.0	0.417320466093	Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.
0.0	0.420324713718	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.318768639645	Great state, great people.
0.0	0.446014327814	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.343597084904	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.395955583509	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.262520485838	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.404449675515	You learn to create a security cabinet.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.300412144219	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.538224138706	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.284811570025	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.
0.0	0.548341024239	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.593049676759	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.222390758967	He was a great negotiator.
0.0	0.437233478665	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.365171006275	Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.
0.0	0.389065084305	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.441246774949	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.479238457622	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.390388762569	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.103910289588	OK?
0.0	0.477834019681	Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come...
0.0	0.452256048551	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.339432555511	We have no borders.
0.0	0.4699094033	We should make women third-class citizens, that we should allow children to be sexually assaulted, that they are a danger to modern society.
0.0	0.37057909376	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.365175357748	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.32716361007	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.334907013706	Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid.
0.0	0.303140840287	We need a collaborative approach.
0.0	0.320286202408	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
0.0	0.507656540374	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.421183166353	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.622345899205	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.45758303319	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.422990464941	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
0.0	0.345444507188	You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.
0.0	0.305747277835	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.
0.0	0.353329285651	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.136623570536	I'm going to tell you -- thank you.
0.0	0.487255881279	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.471182281897	That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.305251398342	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.385593027377	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.287484137848	He believes everything he stands for.
0.0	0.401082485401	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.34637372427	They wouldn't be there except for us.
0.0	0.436461510755	Our vets have been abandoned.
0.0	0.397881010267	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.274540432949	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.354801356544	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.433133959673	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.260879513617	Somebody said, "Oh, that's crass."
0.0	0.521829378434	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.319627603722	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.28033682248	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.27244266748	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.313742497176	I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.
0.0	0.478471318123	In this building, in Trump Tower.
0.0	0.387805287664	We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States.
0.0	0.410070512319	Making fun of disabled people...
0.0	0.106175361871	Yeah.
0.0	0.462162149594	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.321232345472	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.319748446919	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.515586083762	We haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.
0.0	0.295603285432	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.377598035517	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.37887539543	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.
0.0	0.155994395603	Everybody should.
0.0	0.277357754913	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.493443653673	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.336513035922	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.418051024404	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.350898096526	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.373264394442	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.286039565507	It was terrible.
0.0	0.532655028499	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.207428589997	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.137034862642	I think that is...
0.0	0.41846789342	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.212323648439	We know about the Brits.
0.0	0.349517509136	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.33044922814	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.317717807409	I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.356555775338	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.108721029529	We do.
0.0	0.384498088731	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.437600760471	But people have to be alert.
0.0	0.41298257586	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.308893207725	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.446531387497	That's off the table...
0.0	0.387180900669	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.414491465852	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.44478537437	White people?
0.0	0.358561529712	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.664452235938	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.203598130101	Here's what I'd do.
0.0	0.404332009016	We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.419002076028	We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.
0.0	0.315853449869	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.285246112095	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.327953720976	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.395354726076	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.304710652292	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.504780467029	There's no nation on earth that comes close to that number.
0.0	0.345603660763	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.320705325868	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.386027683206	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.401562053343	The Iranians getting more of a presence in Syria, linking with Hezbollah, their proxy in Lebanon, would threaten Israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with Assad's future.
0.0	0.317057491102	That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.
0.0	0.329451589856	You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.
0.0	0.351216786242	Find out what I said to Greenspan.
0.0	0.420370262	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.444652395584	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.281387266121	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.345140423867	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.377704923356	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.317336186796	That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities.
0.0	0.108721029529	I have.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.298101211933	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.410232352719	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.370004132359	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.269500350273	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.298786310501	And as our party's nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.531485579969	Thousands.
0.0	0.537175208604	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
1.0	0.601150799244	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.268433709166	I need your help.
0.0	0.451216950214	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.249580400293	Let's keep going.
0.0	0.511651745382	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.387955793638	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.282094634825	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.171306726772	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.137034862642	Think of it.
0.0	0.414963574107	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.447934617249	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.270269589238	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.486000080766	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.554681849542	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.410765849924	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.230158948059	I know the good ones.
0.0	0.267835383361	Hillary doesn't want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her.
0.0	0.298585199271	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.405353999428	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.292777441178	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.123282071021	And here's what's going to happen.
0.0	0.340289917767	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.428475914946	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.419451895179	That's the difference, and that's the kind of leader we need in the White House.
0.0	0.495219439841	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.365606806261	Quite likely, for that reason.
0.0	0.299404932143	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.108721029529	It was against Assad.
0.0	0.243816761493	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
0.0	0.143878671662	We can do that.
0.0	0.439156396008	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.429597416242	You have to lead.
0.0	0.496232552897	Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally.
0.0	0.42932151796	I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.
0.0	0.48330483547	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
0.0	0.330495888063	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.353300507408	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.169811038433	You're right about that.
0.0	0.388902703494	Number two, we had a really good plan.
0.0	0.457693819799	And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.
0.0	0.415800520077	But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.
0.0	0.429805343188	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.277947891167	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.475663803621	I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons.
0.0	0.438138542686	You're seeing cities like San Francisco, cities like Los Angeles doing it, and they are doing it well and workers are able to have more disposable income.
0.0	0.27662497758	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.285690511001	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.1874942006	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.686424936518	Of course.
0.0	0.334723280045	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.473896947638	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.381501061844	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.465090800294	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.
0.0	0.314062924222	That's true.
0.0	0.35114407916	That's fine.
0.0	0.363169969633	But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn't cut and run.
0.0	0.308948906873	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.579241194981	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.277559670289	... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street.
0.0	0.376868470147	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.288949366921	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.371394003878	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.428977152989	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.445665577626	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.370693316724	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.455890669422	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.387201696577	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.126564408081	Yes.
0.0	0.278991521973	I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.
0.0	0.394601356016	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.
0.0	0.388747707728	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.277396771625	But not for us.
0.0	0.426634845009	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.358612436287	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.526068233153	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.433589183595	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
0.0	0.322751623226	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.214972170701	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.367362642633	Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.
0.0	0.346840631491	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.3318616435	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.304287774107	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.269449216159	So you might not.
0.0	0.581167548546	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
1.0	0.804122109687	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.349882952532	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.265758139487	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.462523834073	Wall Street today has too much political power.
0.0	0.404234918814	But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.
0.0	0.452374761735	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.419167991246	This group needs to be confronted and defeated.
0.0	0.360770180572	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.403287569462	We have losers.
0.0	0.440608744018	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.389141512351	And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave.
0.0	0.333656217558	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.36703635759	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.304191219492	But it's a lot safer.
0.0	0.279741213646	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.464603242969	And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.
0.0	0.430269283533	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.301096275373	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.409074103894	I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures.
0.0	0.431728610423	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.419787214681	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...
0.0	0.402565814962	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.133440261022	All right.
0.0	0.302890327562	... do I go -- let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.481450666707	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
1.0	0.534487300767	Nancy, the blueprint in Maryland that we followed was yes, we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment.
0.0	0.276955229818	You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.
0.0	0.477045044794	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
1.0	0.593126842258	$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work.
0.0	0.329566257072	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.441471601693	What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS.
0.0	0.423584199828	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.412723731243	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.320651847641	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.426702015235	Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.
0.0	0.353462451923	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.202320114586	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.432483851762	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.356344243805	And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition, including Russia, to help us destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.329494119814	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.345367637189	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.545645100118	And universities.
1.0	0.496266132013	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.451387054998	In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, "what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"
0.0	0.379997456102	Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.
0.0	0.319561667515	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.44828896658	First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, "they cannot have it all."
0.0	0.378558646057	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.397157624865	Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe.
0.0	0.203418735981	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
1.0	0.590456816776	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.428603817709	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.263950498426	No vision at all.
0.0	0.315737460451	I won't be doing that.
0.0	0.312839921944	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.548392846345	When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
0.0	0.351872728311	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.
0.0	0.376561972734	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.39005706751	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.385969695943	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.189782384844	No, I love them.
0.0	0.327067816374	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.274588984916	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.303633520766	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.541505770852	To tell Qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep.
0.0	0.502166532371	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.
0.0	0.248233384758	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.490307696842	It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested.
0.0	0.385672567579	What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger.
0.0	0.36365312124	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.356020487438	Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.
0.0	0.12018631365	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.282568224534	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.433525986759	And I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well.
0.0	0.520399163287	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.36104588138	And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.352000007635	So the reporter said to me the other day, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person.
0.0	0.410115137362	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.321060138251	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.427242133099	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.29706757524	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.427067573459	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.303390412577	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.229729441533	That's good.
0.0	0.349929470403	And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.
0.0	0.411646033364	We can end welfare for those here illegally.
0.0	0.222873178317	I don't think we're at war with all Muslims.
0.0	0.430876499999	Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
0.0	0.239489107864	I have no idea.
0.0	0.322739550224	I am advocating...
0.0	0.431141897285	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.395972552171	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.253072401131	Just get me a job.
0.0	0.348314211582	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
0.0	0.108721029529	I was not at all.
0.0	0.543539539423	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.335672848089	And there is a lot we can do in college affordability.
0.0	0.388103452809	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
1.0	0.648370487413	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.164023235009	That's what we need.
0.0	0.326823619199	But I would say this to you, Bret.
0.0	0.443702628649	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
0.0	0.238362249444	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.345131778264	(APPLAUSE) They're trying to prevent people from registering to vote.
0.0	0.391243877554	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.294174990769	I waited and I got the scars to show for it.
0.0	0.390018871576	She did it for convenience.
0.0	0.247490429054	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.415131446793	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.108721029529	What do we do?
0.0	0.234922490969	And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.
0.0	0.436386846936	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.1632839751	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.385997404188	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.388364462975	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.556382024917	The number of women --
0.0	0.563123250921	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.388763992348	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.333328282361	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.43451020515	We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it.
0.0	0.350599429616	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.277312596873	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.353972767885	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.343860527933	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.435290927798	That is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.
0.0	0.434122425969	Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them.
0.0	0.308612228383	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.
0.0	0.498658178283	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.464539042912	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.634276180447	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.48049920346	Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers.
0.0	0.364240414043	We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
0.0	0.428353493794	The United States must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.337793120747	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.418992479481	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.452393851987	In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.
0.0	0.436745522323	I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.
0.0	0.441193324423	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.451058141192	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.121761302873	But look...
0.0	0.24506253249	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.430044400503	We have a lot of work to do, to better prepare our nation and to better lead this world into this new century.
0.0	0.299164758042	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.201727143096	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.53083089233	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.413346585003	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
1.0	0.616793359361	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.442749492107	You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
0.0	0.446551872482	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.423747091236	And that's what we have= representing us.
0.0	0.347355714416	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.496743728555	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.420704596897	There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan.
0.0	0.437077074271	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.311468683478	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.239236236406	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.429653383638	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.412980659085	All the time.
0.0	0.52937353833	Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.
0.0	0.390237564158	Now the Libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge ISIS from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.
0.0	0.455127622008	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
1.0	0.717696950789	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.360809684172	And, yes, we are at war with those people.
0.0	0.288567309081	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.472650873487	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.529587999149	We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York.
0.0	0.369720409124	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.396311775073	It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.
0.0	0.421039226503	Make ourselves stronger at home, but also our role in the world, yes, is also to confront evil when it rises.
0.0	0.318311927607	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.306409121934	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.686424936518	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.364348544819	Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face.
0.0	0.3277090779	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.
0.0	0.345257897169	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.234457251542	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.340756310514	There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
0.0	0.353417957073	And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.
0.0	0.413056546761	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.281004610232	Thank you Chris...
0.0	0.222358355437	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.430902294883	But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.
0.0	0.490516133992	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.449586334552	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.510344533416	The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.
0.0	0.297192295693	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.538074085015	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.400540047527	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.461833941406	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.370896506694	I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.
0.0	0.197572526738	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.44363315826	We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...
0.0	0.497242096915	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
0.0	0.360937873366	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.460398374281	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy.
1.0	0.820287390547	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.447905864388	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.268307241931	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.133440261022	That's not right.
0.0	0.161663180424	We're friends.
0.0	0.375434393157	And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young, old, everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard.
0.0	0.286477807583	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
1.0	0.744342921992	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
0.0	0.237106269852	You know, I like Marco.
0.0	0.306872956938	The Obama administration.
0.0	0.450166581937	As president, I would make the administrator of USAID an actual cabinet member.
0.0	0.447772958749	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.409254483131	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.342136690257	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.416268674527	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.
0.0	0.374264294677	We have people that aren't working.
0.0	0.357323840618	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.472112029041	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.353210093258	I would prioritize them.
0.0	0.330272243694	I have a problem with that, Martha.
0.0	0.361084005006	And Teddy Roosevelt is right.
0.0	0.436530633242	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.362355361107	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
1.0	0.42970127339	Well, we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists.
0.0	0.498471347068	The young officer who was killed responding to the Planned Parenthood murders.
1.0	0.504879738017	I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer.
0.0	0.323281691208	Becky --
0.0	0.261830849776	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.245008937441	And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.
0.0	0.335490141339	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.
0.0	0.607715946476	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.299148357923	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
0.0	0.335092901169	We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.
0.0	0.398066494948	And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world.
0.0	0.524925966306	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.53906784676	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.372444409232	And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go.
0.0	0.36664814799	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.363721007716	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.46243286701	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.108721029529	...
0.0	0.359879135682	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.47816723784	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.416928719994	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.453947351812	He's weak on immigration.
0.0	0.41985746769	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.398672096113	You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon.
0.0	0.258199136142	They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.
0.0	0.328696507526	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.386184690065	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.435232741445	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.163462099069	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.515737921999	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.542006073857	We have three children, eight, five and one.
0.0	0.413883763949	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.304624679752	We now have that.
0.0	0.510174731481	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.338225885915	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.242726827112	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.256883558337	They will never make America great again.
0.0	0.317988466772	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.
0.0	0.288457676287	I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?
0.0	0.288941707534	Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months.
0.0	0.370852361226	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.377564497402	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.439580545146	Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
0.0	0.686424936518	Of course, you would.
0.0	0.207689438866	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.346112067606	Judgment matters as well.
1.0	0.640624264925	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.284896337293	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
0.0	0.305226814054	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.315630166767	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.325356435372	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.388441813734	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.106175361871	Yeah.
0.0	0.270473473192	They're a scam.
0.0	0.413709296468	All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee.
0.0	0.377422076847	Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire.
0.0	0.254093370592	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.355082611046	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.50644491436	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.463118117453	And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent.
0.0	0.498001917339	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.108721029529	These...
0.0	0.410284106282	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.356075103743	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.29035293714	There's been no crowd like this.
0.0	0.241758252808	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.137942663083	Okay.
0.0	0.295122156214	Really big league.
0.0	0.103910289588	OK?
0.0	0.295387207502	That's not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.
0.0	0.333023733082	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.487804020059	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.373000837574	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.521461926903	Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
0.0	0.497610027095	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.405746988137	Check it out.
0.0	0.283599563007	We will do very, very well, very, very well.
0.0	0.342817630084	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.389581530401	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.473174502286	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.433347699087	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.328952690397	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.131179705084	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.451184405135	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.530496434574	But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.
0.0	0.339011430058	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.319190672162	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.290315707045	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.407491881554	If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.
0.0	0.244018247679	I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary...
0.0	0.26173573772	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.432848067949	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.447995951138	ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.
0.0	0.239754451146	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.212256571745	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.451378627684	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.182388757375	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.309554293286	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
1.0	0.73770746149	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.334501421923	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.469949764225	But the United States is not the policeman of the world.
0.0	0.39208392485	I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out.
0.0	0.478092457049	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.314736542887	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
0.0	0.444842991281	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.155557373383	I think he'd be a great spirit."
0.0	0.420653173468	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.121761302873	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.293160260276	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.381752815489	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.268469257754	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.326956053016	And, you know, I do think it's important to do exactly what Senator Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about, and that they talk to each of us about.
0.0	0.404007167006	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.313110691692	And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.
0.0	0.397196811179	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.201538784117	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.326941336073	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.224196538442	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.590376799615	Number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own.
0.0	0.270945073094	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.422265383569	But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.
0.0	0.474571553721	Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS.
0.0	0.387998818152	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.386611775978	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.471650344143	But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.327817365735	I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.
0.0	0.2184949038	We say "we're gonna protect."
0.0	0.108721029529	Both.
0.0	0.411734349421	I'm meeting with three of them in the next week.
0.0	0.442891293737	But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
0.0	0.263705199898	When did we beat Japan at anything?
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.410067578479	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
1.0	0.485620921618	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.342607081317	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.308093946867	Now, our country needs -- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
0.0	0.315625787871	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
0.0	0.308823331627	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.458563787505	How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years.
0.0	0.362040841989	I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.
0.0	0.34105556157	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.489898543253	You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks.
0.0	0.363232037235	You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.
0.0	0.259037023176	We've got to hate the Muslims."
0.0	0.21756640178	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.280807180782	I love this country.
0.0	0.403361484324	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.527574631087	Two points.
0.0	0.415024638914	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.26744282818	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.362825731522	And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work.
0.0	0.255954411425	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.232891201269	They'll all come back.
0.0	0.518271489115	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.399920306463	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.344547360948	I was in Burlington, Iowa.
0.0	0.255688749542	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.499415267532	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
1.0	0.473915232557	And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent.
0.0	0.395627945305	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.229729441533	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.227527835718	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.348687673671	... Chris, your questions that you...
0.0	0.340720834139	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.312127807391	Not bad.
0.0	0.145344943863	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.171085737167	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.4414117656	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.320606227294	Neil...
0.0	0.285899166026	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.205562402127	What sense is that?
0.0	0.341052509781	You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911.
0.0	0.240347219251	Well, I'll tell you who is on my side.
0.0	0.446586058724	I've spent my entire life, since I started as a young lawyer for the Children's Defense Fund, trying to figure out how we can even the odds for so many people in America, this great country of ours, who are behind, who don't have a chance.
0.0	0.240607259364	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.267309457207	And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.
0.0	0.167931488554	But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.
0.0	0.225201560277	But get this.
0.0	0.418725979512	He said, "Yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.277572437165	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.
0.0	0.143878671662	I can.
0.0	0.586973538816	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.493429046218	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.211462861403	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.303662216979	Chris...
0.0	0.225308457245	I don't want it.
0.0	0.203577036588	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.286605602779	We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
0.0	0.451965258233	We've enacted it in our state.
0.0	0.340630867786	We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.
0.0	0.308725913164	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.179787797212	They knew that.
0.0	0.481296096575	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.256275373093	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.439335567761	Our country is in serious trouble.
0.0	0.464226746474	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.449344593562	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	0.330872501925	You don't have to.
1.0	0.5897248012	In fact, wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century, after my husband's administration.
0.0	0.515327463367	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.348937627823	Number one, we're going to keep ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.479148185864	Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.
0.0	0.37916858109	You read about all the companies now that are doing business -- about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on.
0.0	0.388485194213	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.434429402473	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.436758113871	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.393252656858	Our next president...
0.0	0.364381653194	And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.
0.0	0.270375936833	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.373078277465	We now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act, and I don't think we should have to be defending it among Democrats.
0.0	0.403056113623	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.322133536427	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.415396791601	Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people.
0.0	0.375641818466	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
0.0	0.126564408081	Yes.
0.0	0.401298679818	We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.
0.0	0.313608817216	We have problems with Russia.
0.0	0.343697656705	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
1.0	0.672911134147	And I have assets -- big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected -- 9 billion 240 million dollars.
0.0	0.525393639183	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.427096208295	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.344475558618	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.41431924648	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.371516793283	And one of his little boys said to him, "Dad, what happens if Donald Trump wins and we have to move out of our homes?"
0.0	0.294080763355	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.262472148611	He didn't know.
0.0	0.337108728218	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.360816557253	Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.
0.0	0.319748152074	You know why three?
0.0	0.347627424328	He's not arming the Kurds.
0.0	0.328078062246	But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college.
0.0	0.286541804559	But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting.
0.0	0.442891286661	And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.
0.0	0.31788041381	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.438767568007	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.
1.0	0.793599230454	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.462869565996	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.311950139472	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.367241916701	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.408963607178	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.396339557275	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.330064643586	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.415086147134	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
0.0	0.317017588717	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.345318985052	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.349298140149	One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together.
0.0	0.202423401465	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.450460615694	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.283141763107	We're up 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.48678093042	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.398115247691	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.488585962359	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.471726118584	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.361995638062	I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.
0.0	0.447669061045	You do legislation.
0.0	0.223658989178	But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate.
0.0	0.456799891559	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.404474050848	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.467254357127	Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.
0.0	0.427056496847	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.254959391381	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.355343311808	They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America.
0.0	0.187118553563	I think I am a nice person.
0.0	0.378843918635	But I was born here.
0.0	0.431658489592	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.
0.0	0.334787471072	And Abdullah said something recently, very important.
0.0	0.326151712009	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.458050525645	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.108721029529	...
0.0	0.589367831342	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.366585136402	Everybody's for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.402289923559	I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
0.0	0.353249928639	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.408846678785	The big banks--
0.0	0.512843098551	No, both the federal and a state approach.
1.0	0.816514615868	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.478012018121	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.447346842495	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.205982173774	I think there is a consensus.
0.0	0.409585385087	How does that help us?  TRUMP R 15 94 1 N Where is that good?
0.0	0.558847367597	By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started.
0.0	0.347065470213	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.299121168584	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.328179611647	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.215439934876	I tell you that.
0.0	0.37244901048	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.242587606756	It really is important that we go forward on this.
0.0	0.423836089114	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.346554119768	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.395272304738	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.132624520149	Everybody knows that.
1.0	0.64212755343	They were wrong.
0.0	0.32213832397	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
0.0	0.383464153299	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.143878671662	You can do both.
0.0	0.411079963566	This is the election...
0.0	0.248958043441	I know the overrated ones.
0.0	0.437395837525	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.44802541853	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.271406159795	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.284524618849	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.372422951283	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.279725597376	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.395554858105	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.336684854529	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
1.0	0.601264152847	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.335679150662	Well, thank you.
0.0	0.423422508169	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.379564552736	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.26356884686	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
0.0	0.398440649827	We will -- when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice.
0.0	0.38557040083	Because you realize that people depending on you.
0.0	0.562613737359	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.418708350542	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.488210006182	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.360315889609	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.287632191587	What a brilliant idea that would be.
0.0	0.167327344253	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
0.0	0.433273713989	There's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.
0.0	0.314062924222	That's not true.
0.0	0.2627761336	That will change everything.
0.0	0.194515178145	We've got nothing.
0.0	0.32388296147	They can't.
0.0	0.311681156332	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.31234767099	I promise.
0.0	0.449535828499	And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.
0.0	0.354120325348	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.342714343322	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.598720690051	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.213356667281	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.445125271091	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.354186491068	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
0.0	0.304842919822	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.374420351881	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.304159602959	So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.
0.0	0.302572873823	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.361996532717	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.615424495796	...income tax...
0.0	0.263871923876	So, so important.
0.0	0.428484289782	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.454508015332	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.171122454124	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.470989616278	I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.
0.0	0.372788494734	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.498725637254	They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.
0.0	0.261659989763	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.419716987832	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.34005259351	That's the job.
0.0	0.43490109611	Al Qaida was based in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.394027304626	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
1.0	0.824114895933	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.337300578581	... Chris, keep it coming...
0.0	0.286067073972	And we are not England.
0.0	0.37083845759	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.218953262128	I've gotta do it."
0.0	0.277136978267	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.357386922821	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.244337561537	I'm asking you for your vote.
1.0	0.392286133897	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.24020413435	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.215352425498	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.313066356125	I'd like to offer a...
0.0	0.416613178324	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.34854697915	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.393856862405	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
1.0	0.695198985847	He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.
0.0	0.343218447728	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.431524016965	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.512470103402	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.371206233966	I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses.
0.0	0.294647570223	You learn to create feedback mechanisms.
0.0	0.350898206782	No, John.
0.0	0.344530690949	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
0.0	0.542057363895	But at the end of the day, what you have right now are millions of Americans working two or three jobs because their wages that they are earning are just too low.
0.0	0.363469487433	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.252623023922	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.32286405506	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.37662847406	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.474836996466	It's their money.
0.0	0.297295880393	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
1.0	0.659938958401	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.414335739475	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.314348333008	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.383483685404	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.106175361871	Yeah.
0.0	0.262126603412	And a lot of people are doing that.
0.0	0.259552723356	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.228075459567	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.420221519416	What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria, when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family you'd better get out now.
0.0	0.402859180962	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.283976698109	Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.
0.0	0.305198921476	Who denies that it is crazy...
1.0	0.761537626083	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.44306084654	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.306543150665	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.28657457456	And I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate.
0.0	0.428769623692	Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint.
0.0	0.403069057428	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.281825283924	If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're (inaudible).
0.0	0.108721029529	2,000?
0.0	0.67419714625	Could we loan you $4 billion"?
0.0	0.397564430951	John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL, and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening.
0.0	0.314634927006	I don't care.
0.0	0.326758268616	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
1.0	0.515536751066	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.385620819684	But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be looking for new sources of energy.
0.0	0.379633616051	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.473148206007	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.278663121903	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.250718060707	You want one?
0.0	0.450551005999	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.301241355301	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.384233821602	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.560093226874	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.313828599804	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.320398542758	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.354430122321	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.514058890747	The business model of Wall Street is fraud.
0.0	0.291849123005	But you know what we did in Maryland?
0.0	0.341948842101	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.392247722313	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.303649655247	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.3188514572	Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done.
0.0	0.23885870622	They're going to build in Mexico.
0.0	0.312902857861	I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video.
0.0	0.310292960089	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.345788313151	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.318240506044	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.263415650664	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.301664317325	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.488030315015	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.383047159876	I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third.
0.0	0.550647595976	They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care.
0.0	0.15444404082	It's nice.
0.0	0.264187593408	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.219287764346	They thought something was wrong.
0.0	0.385892469057	I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.
0.0	0.336481123805	How are they going to beat ISIS?
0.0	0.427205830288	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.298741189317	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.498417919086	So as a nation we need to increase what we invest in Pell grants.
0.0	0.378574532943	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.346870069505	Chris, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.226213850269	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.218943183307	Oh.
1.0	0.736079210688	It didn't say a word about legalization.
0.0	0.502512149271	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.166177656275	Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.
0.0	0.360700685696	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
0.0	0.397954515797	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.455113229303	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.403748958687	I guess the one I -- I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after Bin Laden.
0.0	0.589294722109	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.434517691971	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.464528576124	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.377852354797	Border security has always been a part of that debate.
0.0	0.195285575556	I totally get that.
0.0	0.437446946435	Wall Street is a threat to the economy.
0.0	0.370760002196	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.384464922521	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
0.0	0.338805337575	And I will go back and say again, AIG was not a big bank.
0.0	0.277986293191	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.428059328942	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.
0.0	0.399867184838	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.0942409610085	We know about the Belgians.
0.0	0.303148611665	Might I respond?
0.0	0.426474212419	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
0.0	0.319386911225	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.422029740981	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.279740012889	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.362608825042	Secondly, we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.
1.0	0.463165772558	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.207312520865	So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
0.0	0.55428314713	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.447137145431	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.384173276893	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.305923310271	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.30426981613	I like China.
0.0	0.486962729646	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.434902319906	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.346739642813	Go on to my website.
0.0	0.225319320393	You know, I've always had a great deal of respect.
0.0	0.27161385212	He's very charming.
0.0	0.470325040885	You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
0.0	0.379340030006	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.163515774345	Sorry.
0.0	0.39685055048	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.371389236903	So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years -- you know, we're at $8 trillion now.
0.0	0.281267659365	He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing?
1.0	0.832170127921	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
0.0	0.379899051094	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.307016821866	Let's put the gun makers and sellers on notice that they're not going to get away with it.
0.0	0.35217879512	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.390681890163	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.39982176783	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.43501152005	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.367465325826	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
1.0	0.382153190328	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.36961644915	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.386047159977	There is a vacuum.
0.0	0.441574326245	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.369351224723	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.388836698048	We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States.
0.0	0.319729269088	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.498414911968	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.282039107812	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.343699699727	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.322852564472	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
0.0	0.291366135032	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.310369000071	I win.
0.0	0.487277630291	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.342903498843	They've become rich.
0.0	0.274083988265	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.
0.0	0.303701579444	I don't think anyone has a magical solution.
0.0	0.219061704865	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.495840785427	It is a disaster.
0.0	0.108721029529	That's what he is.
0.0	0.368739319214	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.346459127236	Ford.
0.0	0.380448170839	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.583068961242	Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.
0.0	0.311407127273	Does my family like me?
1.0	0.75139872359	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
0.0	0.393495591903	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.360481170859	I -- I believe that we should make community college free.
0.0	0.332954532927	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.33418052121	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.188201017324	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.456863846352	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.242279611016	I like them.
0.0	0.405912441957	Fact check me.
0.0	0.320214903598	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.120392077122	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.387032077364	Well, this whole issue concerns me.
0.0	0.370309718805	That's a hard road to walk.
0.0	0.457003577183	The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.
0.0	0.28144429572	And they wanted to make sure it got built.
0.0	0.437270223274	And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.
0.0	0.299208481597	But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand.
0.0	0.372064247619	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.299622121571	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.370762268473	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.437555614153	First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.376872796486	She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.244682181281	So nice, thank you very much.
0.0	0.356990544797	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.371054738231	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.219548111547	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.422814376513	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.
0.0	0.280060939517	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.461627117067	So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.
0.0	0.372882816426	And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people.
0.0	0.39559229368	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.230595019835	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.320206770666	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.337093028524	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.31558002113	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.49125789127	The biggest bank in the world is from China.
0.0	0.416671348602	So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
0.0	0.379768492987	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.254059915617	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.389985547083	It's real estate.
0.0	0.465577493084	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.431878285138	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.372143098405	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.408126441509	No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.
0.0	0.425275583749	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.280715147695	That's not fair.
0.0	0.392996087331	I want this bill to be voted down.
0.0	0.404250750157	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.458459408475	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.
0.0	0.42062050215	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.593819114469	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.425262316355	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.416190025002	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.310755385168	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.146952543683	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.381203977646	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.127501718207	Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid.
0.0	0.44919357348	And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty.
0.0	0.445524055633	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.353288744728	And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.
0.0	0.362909422924	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.430462600256	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.350032256283	Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country.
0.0	0.254550569476	Come on now.
0.0	0.453806816972	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
0.0	0.27770025863	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.265986353757	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.511430131259	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
0.0	0.42492639493	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.331839410861	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.573066664587	Why is it that we are spending per capita far, far more than Canada, which is 100 miles away from my door, that guarantees health care to all people?
0.0	0.289656440079	No, I think they won't.
0.0	0.295450620568	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.370969201359	I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.
1.0	0.292126047539	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.301501274291	I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible.
0.0	0.351546468906	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.399433804571	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.505603865045	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.474066103216	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.349365695401	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.457871819136	A few days ago a similar incident happened.
0.0	0.335726895529	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.421256517663	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.446268224007	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
1.0	0.76392833917	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.356340337861	Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
0.0	0.353237507347	(inaudible).
0.0	0.525420232229	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.412322052681	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.372126540697	But he wasn't a cheerleader.
0.0	0.558593779376	Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.
0.0	0.367746781092	But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.
0.0	0.387716221325	Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks -- between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance.
0.0	0.402691488821	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.38918445175	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.544941579604	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.260403077028	And I -- I thought, if I didn't jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this.
0.0	0.330872501925	No, you weren't.
0.0	0.413799368371	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.288194706495	And for good cause.
0.0	0.440332538253	In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America.
0.0	0.41638595039	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.471657604346	And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.250875128496	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.244333930707	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.600982126935	That is why I support a $12 national federal minimum wage.
0.0	0.239228096525	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.209231049279	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.389479214873	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.254268528739	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.397359305613	You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country.
0.0	0.577219668867	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.343444014929	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.440074534532	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.388553307279	And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans.
0.0	0.4217487367	And that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity -- kill people who are unarmed who should not be killed, they must be held accountable.
0.0	0.156250259019	I will not do that.
0.0	0.386359235946	... And start taking advice...
0.0	0.433611872375	... people all over this country -- not you, Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other.
0.0	0.380691833292	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.311578439803	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.397586486521	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.305734069287	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.3593610935	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.378824832822	I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.
0.0	0.428537571508	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.338816033375	And Martha...
0.0	0.192521553588	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.437850023588	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.451293840247	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.327000849645	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.463212833162	These are often very long- term kinds of investments that have to be made.
0.0	0.539288415709	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.354722278703	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.367040623532	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.294371854202	It's a joke.
1.0	0.557168593606	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.325737723481	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.192222899428	They don't know what they're doing.
1.0	0.391990365548	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.219929223838	And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.
0.0	0.430686950201	My plan is there.
0.0	0.453040646985	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.257976430346	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.365430859809	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.374216374022	I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.48308187143	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.370364865659	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.20451769395	I think we're at war with jihadists who have --
0.0	0.681805715117	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
1.0	0.565660340693	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.493587378543	She voted for it.
0.0	0.39265323061	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.367001003432	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.293774548359	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.17886675704	That's what we believe in.
0.0	0.413272510691	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.399741808809	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.244328385901	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.569359114912	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.476261259877	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.463031652	You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.445566680917	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.406966599702	RADDATZ: OK. Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, right here at Saint Anselm college, Neil Levesque.
0.0	0.421294788626	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.502855230993	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.284579813627	You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that.
0.0	0.187793149124	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.291738904877	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.335261551415	There's a lot packed into that statement.
0.0	0.507069051083	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.328920648401	He couldn't answer the question.
0.0	0.505967447554	And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.
0.0	0.366704253245	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.416435861953	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
1.0	0.285854787257	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
1.0	0.660285151142	A $5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.243955335857	We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.
0.0	0.328225976652	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.234431045759	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.330872501925	I didn't.
1.0	0.530214472376	They built a hotel.
0.0	0.352001579734	May I have a chance to respond to this issue?
0.0	0.288562008132	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.495236257753	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.297022066929	And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.
0.0	0.292531317496	I'm using my own money.
0.0	0.464565243426	We actually passed a living wage.
0.0	0.303296448663	Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...
0.0	0.42983270911	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.419548760203	And I wrote a book about this called Immigration Wars.
0.0	0.267860670957	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.479170848577	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.389237610608	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.48414889032	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.476636950685	I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.
0.0	0.572065255508	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.349003381709	I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.464157863063	And I was determined to do everything that I could to make VA health care the best in the world, to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending.
0.0	0.211269773025	And it has been amazing to me.
0.0	0.347996098622	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.319973603885	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.497724279194	It'll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there's no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.
1.0	0.40501790045	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.330088803513	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.405952779227	Parents, and sons, and daughters and family members, and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them, we must remember this, that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century.
0.0	0.352779603279	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.323780087746	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
0.0	0.440222525561	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.256298138416	You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.
0.0	0.378459285115	Give people a chance.
0.0	0.290277998921	They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there.
0.0	0.600720846839	The number of heroin deaths are growing very, very significantly.
0.0	0.433446118058	Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground.
0.0	0.133440261022	That's right.
0.0	0.391748819823	And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.
0.0	0.293177810395	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.318367027882	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.126564408081	Yes.
0.0	0.300895837895	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.259447468325	I said, "how's it going?"
0.0	0.276588133775	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.
0.0	0.392739628989	Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.441756609003	We now have a gun on every table.
0.0	0.466175935734	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.35274569591	It cannot be contained, it must be defeated.
0.0	0.484247254074	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.413218945549	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.337110187887	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.0942409610085	You know why?
0.0	0.413383391061	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.416435005863	You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down.
0.0	0.543068279012	All through the recession, we defended the highest median income in America and the second highest median income for African American families.
0.0	0.354849631629	We have people that are morally corrupt.
0.0	0.325861484273	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.397065923698	They don't want to raise the minimum wage, they don't want to do anything to increase incomes.
0.0	0.335553678849	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.103910289588	OK.
0.0	0.387978063095	It's Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.
0.0	0.27053197674	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.412959139297	Sit down with people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the house, and work on a bill.
0.0	0.327710527665	You really can't.
0.0	0.440997834203	I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor, I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very, very powerful and most important of all jobs in the United States, the president, whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country.
0.0	0.346112067606	But judgment matters as well.
1.0	0.719244896618	What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons.
0.0	0.136716924859	I'll do it.
0.0	0.424200772847	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.490299031273	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.337942267248	How are these people gonna lead us?
0.0	0.364629840231	If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.
0.0	0.479469811516	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.36884116667	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.290056738938	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.408062091123	That's what I understand is the request from the international...
0.0	0.354419782738	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.414071701939	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.371257420913	But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.345061645006	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.255239947196	I don't need the rhetoric.
0.0	0.304292353657	And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce's great story.
0.0	0.319041766755	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.404978030438	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.180676411094	Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.
0.0	0.507305415758	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.476545784745	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.108721029529	No.
0.0	0.323631296154	We need to move aggressively now.
0.0	0.130019445145	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.357260648717	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.371230337027	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.379011009076	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.402856441811	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.330437885061	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.512750896871	I also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees.
0.0	0.453966126289	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.314639802101	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.331815142017	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
1.0	0.474044392902	In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.
0.0	0.416831850373	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.103910289588	OK.
0.0	0.350645659569	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.369783465953	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.577488216598	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.262211882644	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.377216498639	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.489684541763	We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.
0.0	0.485115381263	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.
0.0	0.205660042524	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.437678822993	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.398202896166	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
0.0	0.268828549763	I think after 11 hours, that's pretty clear, yes.
0.0	0.388021885031	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.44004525971	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.355295300271	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.45937762034	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.476746172694	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.40810553155	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.222122871707	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.228789008442	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.553092297774	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.480819491906	Or would you rather take less later on?
1.0	0.699107717829	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.335610939264	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.221836754772	We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.
0.0	0.169811038433	You're right.
0.0	0.411271819182	I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.163382915409	Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.
0.0	0.448617317224	I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
0.0	0.17886675704	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.515577405002	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.482889804568	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.323421760529	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.333989801554	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.354706694696	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.429618921886	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.422428120185	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.369539888047	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.480707288595	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.506641518387	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.438651423157	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.337954219975	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.324144415859	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.457810154515	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.297608112918	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.422484255757	There are no simple solutions.
0.0	0.334840945444	I gotta build those big buildings.
0.0	0.358819943098	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.355843984003	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.
0.0	0.406722748824	But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.
0.0	0.486040251815	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.378288380826	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.314062692495	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.292796073771	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.414147866041	The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.
0.0	0.350872350749	And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
0.0	0.327348200224	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.394594010265	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.31234732932	Good at email.
0.0	0.450296245888	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.459082463644	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.339091419125	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.205917978145	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.168475137697	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.393535724512	But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything.
0.0	0.406684943119	And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't."
0.0	0.414953716835	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.500665019935	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.408225582551	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.
0.0	0.373666452449	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.375067014558	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.387883927766	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.19600035531	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.
0.0	0.336111855572	We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game.
0.0	0.386853653488	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.275240190671	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.
0.0	0.212361571892	Does anyone know this?"
0.0	0.486610912899	It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.
0.0	0.411993409694	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.416876200612	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.321968559054	That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.
0.0	0.329126634325	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.487288787298	I hire people, they do a Web site.
0.0	0.476097484314	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.0942409610085	You know that.
0.0	0.288636029072	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.360650207203	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.
0.0	0.28196263498	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.486580026134	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.444113265872	So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.
0.0	0.133440261022	Right.
0.0	0.463160443748	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
0.0	0.338650539064	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.413504907196	And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina, and many other Republican states, that because of their right wing political ideology, are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act.

0.0	0.338760995787	Marco, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.407844668445	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.386524031525	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.342918905198	Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.
0.0	0.465753849581	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.293774548359	We actually did it.

0.0	0.390034242199	Saudi Arabia without us is gone.

0.0	0.299305068378	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.353100205172	Well, let's take it one at a time.
0.0	0.595356477239	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.394008109838	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.370979175711	And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.
0.0	0.36226762493	Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.
0.0	0.323235091559	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.404447517956	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.
0.0	0.108721029529	No.
0.0	0.310602554903	That's what the political revolution is about.
0.0	0.445040325854	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.126564408081	Yes.
0.0	0.379660895887	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.
0.0	0.523289023358	End -- end Common Core.
0.0	0.218039040508	You know, that's so simple.
1.0	0.775136033289	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.
0.0	0.26736466949	And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.
0.0	0.45556084606	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.480154765472	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.340811959459	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.437560446438	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.342390653861	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.482663072813	I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.
0.0	0.445128626933	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.398772562265	He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments.

0.0	0.422857533437	The NSA is another big issue.
0.0	0.356264202387	That's American citizenship.
0.0	0.421987801367	We shouldn't have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time.
0.0	0.242397774327	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.273118669985	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.378875182165	And your point is absolutely well taken.
0.0	0.310648544627	And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen.
0.0	0.424940292091	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.411593320268	I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart.
0.0	0.617100034629	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.450101335573	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.31297784629	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.288425601305	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.499587189167	Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons -- three out of four people in prison are black or brown.
0.0	0.379719549912	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.108721029529	You did.
0.0	0.320417430842	Look, the secretary is right.
0.0	0.34144102204	In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance.
0.0	0.35763599244	You can -- you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.
0.0	0.421308055776	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.56722349458	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.435038372683	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.35871788678	We needed 60.
0.0	0.333181527293	You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying.
0.0	0.396817649914	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.257038754434	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.284538457697	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.233671579318	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.404774528587	With all -- with all due respect...
0.0	0.274623328369	Let me just...
0.0	0.286998909764	I am telling the truth.
0.0	0.314062924222	That's not true.
0.0	0.581947954041	And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.
0.0	0.464699563832	Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.
0.0	0.47926072465	You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?
0.0	0.378252813612	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.407202257304	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
0.0	0.368639981209	As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
0.0	0.47073270834	I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
0.0	0.332433999823	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.33375117214	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.429365855299	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.446814857738	And it requires an entire world to come together, including in a very active way, the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.343966631094	It all will be scrutinized.
0.0	0.344566368584	Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values.
0.0	0.370173094971	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
1.0	0.725540427144	Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.
0.0	0.356270121133	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.421823036725	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.402650394302	They have to be alert to problems.
0.0	0.429437652519	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.288002017168	Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform.
0.0	0.390983047891	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.410999277509	The United States has, unfortunately, been victimized by terrorism going back decades.
0.0	0.354637291565	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.398542560299	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.269235371105	And, I will tell you, I love my life.
0.0	0.360836002535	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.414148644049	I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran.
0.0	0.500211426778	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.438225980524	We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up.
0.0	0.30156099522	Those are all really positive developments.
0.0	0.445339027956	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.108721029529	Do it.
0.0	0.214229786096	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.316331609685	): Secretary...
0.0	0.376826152229	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.361878768009	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.169619839962	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.389473540825	China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.27155673882	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.214865684308	Nothing's gonna get done.
0.0	0.106175361871	Yeah.
0.0	0.359724123588	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.360932760419	It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.
0.0	0.406516001	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.338609271995	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.202293894831	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.401687254385	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.394608071696	Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin.
0.0	0.416520042353	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.210809562738	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.342942995028	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.384581677604	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
0.0	0.421193621755	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.378089945025	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.462584050001	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
0.0	0.308680827621	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
1.0	0.64212755343	That's wrong.
0.0	0.405891183307	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.562882166454	Is there an area for a safety net?
1.0	0.695783477329	It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate.
1.0	0.850250198277	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.448492804004	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
1.0	0.547312490813	Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof.
0.0	0.389310189333	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.337885179098	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.334440493286	People who we should be welcoming and working with.
0.0	0.281067741369	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.313083696279	I said, "Is he intelligent?"
0.0	0.317786588337	And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.
0.0	0.459608861436	I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil.
0.0	0.386409773886	She is not qualified to be President of the United States.
0.0	0.299937715056	They have no choice.
0.0	0.350488220985	Thank you, senator.
1.0	0.913283961387	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.259678372051	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.462901764651	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.126564408081	Yes.
0.0	0.392979790422	It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.
0.0	0.335904854942	Folks, it's not too late.
0.0	0.331656005859	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
0.0	0.327519075238	Now, what the magic number is, I don't know, because we don't know the extent of the problem.
0.0	0.391890164022	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.379879064411	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.346689048241	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.305548310223	You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.
0.0	0.466643886165	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.352017619427	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.395059860069	I was mentioned in the question.
1.0	0.769487147866	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.355165940102	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
1.0	0.805719742138	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.41051146458	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.317454881583	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.27259374733	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.393713952276	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.275193353051	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.521000062381	We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.
0.0	0.351690112106	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.403532414376	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.443855313452	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
0.0	0.352718111442	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.359001617905	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.459902023359	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.309281766929	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.378660476423	A lot of the rights that have been won over years, from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights, will be at risk.
0.0	0.408885989433	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.473474321511	It had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.498769009157	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.308919819772	And I think has had a big impact.
0.0	0.436444106673	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.40402965956	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.406160572073	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.442554572035	What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years.
0.0	0.216965569478	Now I want to go back something.
0.0	0.418908481383	this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.
0.0	0.414146604753	But, of course, international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today.
0.0	0.108721029529	...
0.0	0.284965450039	Now, what does that mean?
0.0	0.460796003831	But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America.
0.0	0.38167938547	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.150448874542	I'm ready.
0.0	0.414529668044	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.363805326284	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.483368095226	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.242294381768	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.314062924222	That's true.
0.0	0.364722598534	They can't lead us.
0.0	0.491485007456	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.303243029796	I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis.
0.0	0.290831454344	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.326578287238	We have people that aren't smart.
1.0	0.631821003015	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.310195357356	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.459618382189	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.414767906687	I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.
0.0	0.4054411511	The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.350271057208	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
0.0	0.419897579919	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.32708498238	I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization.
0.0	0.359648162413	We have to come together as a country.
0.0	0.207407946859	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.295508437218	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.481296600157	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.338939880896	If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration.
0.0	0.46052843289	And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and I would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go.
0.0	0.133440261022	Right?
0.0	0.418282202432	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.467105934334	But I...
0.0	0.240427207636	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.278273122577	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.664452235938	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.156250259019	I will do that.
0.0	0.299856065586	And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.
0.0	0.428979055596	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.231061294434	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.445017224986	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.22918507962	I believe we've got to go further.
0.0	0.418763140136	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
0.0	0.412209744498	Both served.
0.0	0.437534840787	Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.
0.0	0.369235958878	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.282606584237	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.445283262919	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.452227215242	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.466651458796	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.444461808029	John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.
0.0	0.311974228457	I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena.
0.0	0.649480953092	He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration.
1.0	0.377891731603	We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
0.0	0.376777739724	I don't get any money from Wall Street.
0.0	0.333285315854	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.321570985083	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.221360152641	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.408697210882	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.358752899244	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.353565585364	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.380421627599	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.311298939041	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.292416880005	Well, I did.
0.0	0.527470790369	They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.
0.0	0.439133385724	And all over New Hampshire, I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose.
0.0	0.339832198619	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.362095729368	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.362988719602	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.348791552301	They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.
0.0	0.330179929463	They had a plan that was good.
0.0	0.381520413329	Never support.
0.0	0.25338181118	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.34913232995	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.285144161148	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.504218752388	We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.
0.0	0.234978000295	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.253988434768	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.431564758673	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.
0.0	0.328179611647	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.414220331178	It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state.
1.0	0.53096513387	Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees -- these are big vehicles -- were left behind for the enemy.
0.0	0.360290255597	Well, thanks for having me.
0.0	0.663348748418	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.688445420805	It was an investment bank.
0.0	0.480628118233	We have a corrupt campaign finance system dominated by Super PACs.
0.0	0.358202523306	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.388730512992	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.276109993813	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.482239707194	At the end of the day, if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities.
0.0	0.37770340622	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.0942409610085	I know.
0.0	0.258087039564	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.33025363355	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.
0.0	0.434929682125	They have no plan now."
0.0	0.128427689916	See?
0.0	0.422894881804	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.
0.0	0.339025633988	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.388102791689	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.388028359045	So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.
1.0	0.285899166026	Don't believe the 5.6.
0.0	0.349354328648	And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in.
0.0	0.534627055613	I never said that.
0.0	0.444969836378	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.504913033609	But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.
0.0	0.28777586202	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.456307864022	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.428681810982	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.317107373786	Well, I think it's perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid.
0.0	0.314009208042	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.566213222636	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.404090973006	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.430770416746	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.312403772612	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.350669053424	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.362575371633	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.444304500449	He's the greatest show on earth.
0.0	0.53530405008	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.145938749555	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.486584097536	I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan.
0.0	0.278315584416	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.40375740617	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.295397375943	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.391698566636	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.169518627085	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.463576446303	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.403324240945	Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.
0.0	0.309533351739	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.344483870459	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.23991079898	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.
0.0	0.37445001845	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.306746336104	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.396463368755	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.495541898518	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.450928942994	Yes, well, roughly.
0.0	0.301241355301	Megyn, that's the problem.
0.0	0.281452062283	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.388668037624	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.282166361882	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.561982867042	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.402812208735	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.455641717558	Media notwithstanding.
0.0	0.423511907994	What part is valid?
0.0	0.295087721461	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.372677071556	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.303294595588	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.250220776589	We will win on everything we do.
1.0	0.826572549859	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.337656621415	We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
0.0	0.309596092547	They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.
0.0	0.406770766509	I don't know and with all due respect to the secretary, Wall Street played by the rules?
0.0	0.487073453009	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.42361340218	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.421473732801	I -- you know, know that Senator Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers.
0.0	0.435278307065	Can I share this quick story?
0.0	0.347714175324	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.37109595442	So what I had to do then is go back and start working on a bill that wasn't the bill that I wanted.
0.0	0.414262492091	There are many crises that come -- a water crisis in Toledo.
0.0	0.24372744379	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.48780187078	But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.
0.0	0.489008705895	We were the first in the family.
0.0	0.438357136099	They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of Syria and Iraq.
1.0	0.387172806161	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.421025891788	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.4039558164	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.455909610027	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.262903843327	I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here...
0.0	0.369789206022	We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we're not going to hand out citizenship cards, either.
0.0	0.45241785963	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
1.0	0.59407996855	People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.
0.0	0.215371776768	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.368184716306	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.330798287333	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.680426217308	So the total is $8,737,540,00.
0.0	0.267089740313	See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together.
0.0	0.414238524709	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.280965513898	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.320884020277	This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along.
0.0	0.0942409610085	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.409703432726	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.330258928847	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.381199160514	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.3845710331	When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.
0.0	0.458430535957	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.45504426763	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.416533424626	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.171420434635	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.400632190044	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.534627055613	I never said that.
0.0	0.505204360512	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.195787228139	We never dreamt we'd ever see it."
0.0	0.353907837883	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.336185603296	All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.
0.0	0.397594253367	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.452520607497	I think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12 it would be the highest historical average we've ever had.
0.0	0.28040219864	And I watch the speeches.

0.0	0.369517060998	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.161570355515	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.447513283336	And so, you go the extra mile.
0.0	0.244328385901	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.

0.0	0.380024128312	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.149089680636	But I can tell you this.
0.0	0.586955580998	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.221343578593	Okay, thank you.

0.0	0.294013564064	So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly.
0.0	0.314175185475	You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.
1.0	0.928221794347	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.465044207796	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.523415925948	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.

0.0	0.443641180685	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.294882658848	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.162427589991	I think so, right.
0.0	0.397792200084	Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top.

0.0	0.32388296147	I can't do it.

0.0	0.186845245927	How stupid are they?

0.0	0.384208318288	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.419746806866	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.518945928257	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.
0.0	0.519316708966	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.3295120779	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
1.0	0.359536834864	I think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street...
0.0	0.47115805868	And if our middle class makes more money, they spend more money, and our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.439157659011	It was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up.
0.0	0.35422595343	She's an American citizen.
0.0	0.413044883705	That's calling it what it is.
0.0	0.465298288735	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.395832446817	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.443187152521	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.558735211258	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.313216802198	I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.352530647595	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.468179152845	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.325356560932	If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.
0.0	0.418643469495	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.41060182696	I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.
0.0	0.108721029529	But...
0.0	0.688472911232	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.339133190253	They would like to rip it up and start all over again, throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now.
0.0	0.179293840569	But I learned a lot.
0.0	0.324447438714	We need to do it now as a nation.
0.0	0.192208171895	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.103910289588	OK...
0.0	0.319271343562	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.310838738321	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.
0.0	0.608981229668	We have a stock market that is so bloated.
0.0	0.182801006102	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.291393532945	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.503451366666	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.327299524895	Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
0.0	0.466304291583	We saw a Muslim brotherhood president installed, and then we saw him ousted and the army back.
0.0	0.329326383708	What is the best way to do it?
0.0	0.352617807887	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
0.0	0.423519672069	... family leave for a very long time...
0.0	0.408078135842	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.401453183197	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.429685259997	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.440955744469	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.291345937926	Just can't happen.
0.0	0.496757186181	ISIS, now, is the major priority.
0.0	0.295200766855	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...
0.0	0.480623999443	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.413814106357	It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.
1.0	0.753067117489	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
0.0	0.248056604488	So Hillary and I have a difference.
0.0	0.269806311128	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.274623328369	Let me just...
0.0	0.356960745571	You've got to go the extra mile.
1.0	0.660080162089	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
0.0	0.360033280042	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.413397285201	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.366010252915	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.337110187887	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.297407823148	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.304075666922	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.444864314358	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.452652905926	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.429872502	And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.
0.0	0.44004874431	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.342059206584	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.600479820084	We raised the minimum wage.
0.0	0.324959981445	And that this world, with American leadership, can and must come together to destroy them.
0.0	0.555180937693	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.376102811518	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.324301086536	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
0.0	0.144716895216	And guess what?
0.0	0.410129563437	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.371263138954	Our country has tremendous potential.
0.0	0.451439452622	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.575651902836	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.212162507993	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.3023814605	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.
0.0	0.469963442555	And we have to stop all the divisions.
0.0	0.254611986487	I think this is a very difficult issue.
0.0	0.212853145268	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.357142613951	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.318885769156	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.327716532074	There are hundreds of things like that.
0.0	0.377086300304	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.461825661761	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.344970684088	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.396326618971	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.170474608275	And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are.
0.0	0.591671538008	No hour is too short, no dollar too small.
0.0	0.273333288197	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.325507618271	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.411326274395	We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America.
0.0	0.126564408081	Yes.
0.0	0.321593732434	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
1.0	0.351834752998	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.469137911936	My oldest daughter's a teacher.
0.0	0.514810059968	In fact, American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the National Institute of Health and that we then tested through the FDA.
0.0	0.394193524013	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.484317152995	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.167007925432	But you know what else they're anxious about?
0.0	0.36678119971	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.553332993409	But I have another one, Ford.
0.0	0.364967570594	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.202325244997	That can be done.
1.0	0.559211056188	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.325935051472	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.431228511481	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.70340083799	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.353210455529	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.398230153796	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.27729785403	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.256201333744	That makes no sense at all.
0.0	0.370425217809	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.405817521486	That's the future of banking in America.
1.0	0.504052708086	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.348723002572	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.449099622217	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.229456755773	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.161097825674	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.458806893696	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.319748152074	You know why three?
0.0	0.506364752669	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.296635778202	I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.
0.0	0.438592924774	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.551269080564	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.235923049423	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.
0.0	0.38580159603	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.414929894969	Marco opposed this because they made a deal.
0.0	0.372503345028	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.357083471	I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.
0.0	0.397044965111	Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly.
0.0	0.36828425895	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.
0.0	0.35276888503	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.378284270334	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.456434914375	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.
0.0	0.289073632863	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.286103449997	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.410190081094	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.304986137862	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.363307281771	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.218941359006	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.

0.0	0.514886781945	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.255016907867	Can I just say this...
0.0	0.274015045347	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.290081712101	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.103910289588	OK?
0.0	0.419439158124	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.242895615951	They are not going to go away on their own.
0.0	0.34220658375	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.388029856723	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.336757070824	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.33730161458	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.380196462126	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.386411903757	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
0.0	0.487333089313	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.471404105284	Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems.
0.0	0.400602051472	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.388953926492	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.498956810789	I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation.
0.0	0.354862203211	He was a little teddy bear to me.
0.0	0.320900558049	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.390599220388	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.325476235335	They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists.
0.0	0.298128023219	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.172919918874	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.278132428098	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.529727280563	And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.396861827224	And for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.
0.0	0.564887546589	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
0.0	0.227315875783	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.315795448823	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.108721029529	It's not.
0.0	0.426947961218	The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders.
0.0	0.356136716458	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.179002218249	Sure did.
0.0	0.190078745489	I'm running.
0.0	0.314844174421	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.32985306226	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.307363838242	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.405568947487	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.401012997563	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.318590705418	That is not what America should be about.
1.0	0.605813374403	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
0.0	0.312356476134	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.401684130186	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.46301723428	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.285978520114	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.375719531139	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.28683068256	I want security.
0.0	0.351437137494	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
1.0	0.611200236377	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.662271054702	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.40442205753	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.343089949721	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
0.0	0.509648802517	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.296204289012	All of us believe climate change is real.
0.0	0.387686105472	We did our own rallies.
0.0	0.187454627912	That's what really matters.
0.0	0.534627055613	I never said that.
0.0	0.326846202583	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.382516751212	When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.301343700349	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.4952229494	We're spending $80 billion locking people up, disproportionately Latino and African American.
0.0	0.39601993465	We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground."
0.0	0.456744706111	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.
0.0	0.325703047208	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
1.0	0.46055690979	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.259226473444	I said no.
0.0	0.416829318103	That is why we need to make police -- and I speak as a former mayor.
0.0	0.17236178269	It never happens.
0.0	0.328118583219	And there are many ways of doing it.
0.0	0.303591387391	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.
0.0	0.473208803827	Reinstating Glass- Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough.
0.0	0.478209535257	We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq.
0.0	0.493646891783	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.410252441723	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.443176087653	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.276135533561	Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.
0.0	0.483156494841	Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.
1.0	0.797172513297	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.280587225626	People that know me, like me.
0.0	0.182272767448	We have to do something.
0.0	0.380431527118	This will end.
0.0	0.32130723016	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.510507495412	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.187882175732	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.311934712624	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.438001957816	We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents.
0.0	0.303961852232	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.300027064803	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.327674365373	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.27574434134	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.271720681692	... issues they have to respond to.
0.0	0.248184057031	I know the bad ones.
0.0	0.345546513248	And it's impossible for our people here to compete.
0.0	0.390899553605	My heart, like all of us in this room, John, and all the people across our country, my hearts go out to the people of France in this moment of loss.
0.0	0.423928765195	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.463097534864	This country is changing.
0.0	0.307076363647	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.259768480815	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.388236866001	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.224718941605	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.41311377656	The troops on the ground should not be American troops.
0.0	0.452496956295	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.479303528973	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.305152103643	We have to stand with them.
1.0	0.606495516267	That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.
1.0	0.842703426465	Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.
0.0	0.313370868171	So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.
1.0	0.755465167038	Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?
0.0	0.355194362668	It was a different situation in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.411395229191	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.531073589017	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.255220951428	John, I think somewhere between...
0.0	0.179530018202	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.426819935087	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
0.0	0.386458941281	But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
0.0	0.379903001774	Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us.
0.0	0.408937208899	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.133440261022	Right.
0.0	0.179860637638	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.375181581622	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.347122759278	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.386841302208	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.444601981797	Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.481194299793	The first vote hasn't been counted.
0.0	0.236132219468	You see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, I'm an optimist
0.0	0.153063155659	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.416375393374	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.441254472604	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.309876283206	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.296798792086	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.462663160814	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.108721029529	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.322125628559	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
1.0	0.763453218617	But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.
0.0	0.635106334567	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.318240506044	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.347231492006	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.44712918993	Mark my words.
0.0	0.379872429844	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.
0.0	0.204810419543	As a Catholic, that's what I want to do.
0.0	0.30103854197	And he got nasty.
1.0	0.696995560665	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.387721468574	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.328053260685	About Medicare?
0.0	0.386234343071	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.437014851731	So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.
0.0	0.108721029529	Megyn?
0.0	0.277555244323	So I said, "That's OK." I'm proud of my net worth.
0.0	0.381288143757	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.
0.0	0.416945940324	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.295475042792	And he is a proud American Muslim.
0.0	0.312751844883	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.473559148502	They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
0.0	0.405333410589	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.57180979383	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.39413778309	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.328373418067	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.301625641845	Why weren't they vigilant?
1.0	0.753677340041	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
0.0	0.414367710093	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.436912965955	And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.
0.0	0.421658840078	Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.313223932445	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.4394231649	This entire question was an attack, but that's (inaudible)
0.0	0.272542081524	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.32824791961	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.445486081346	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.41149908951	We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress, but it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us.
0.0	0.499707032391	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.481681229422	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.531853509846	And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.
0.0	0.354292158775	Sadly, the American dream is dead.
0.0	0.431344469627	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.394193524013	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.384727563025	And now many of these candidates want to cut it.
0.0	0.0942409610085	And you know what?
0.0	0.503080301928	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.273611570557	They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do.
0.0	0.285899166026	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.327520793494	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
1.0	0.521558549855	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty, and we're the only country in the world -- virtually the only country that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.137034862642	Think about that.
0.0	0.151679065521	I think they'd want to hear it.
0.0	0.261128201461	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.321127384992	We don't win.
0.0	0.390038533398	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.420579988249	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.24218207166	I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.
0.0	0.41328672773	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.50712922414	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.242428765071	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.338081562099	There's never going do be perfect bill.
0.0	0.492192237572	I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war.
0.0	0.38781603171	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.455745479118	But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.
0.0	0.262111089077	You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question.
0.0	0.370061852663	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.361101661551	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.
0.0	0.394843102669	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.344152422224	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.468235267991	People came back from Iraq and Afghanistan without legs, without arms.
0.0	0.464946465213	She's the senator from New York.
0.0	0.417832796571	Rebuild the country's infrastructure.
0.0	0.521753166112	At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.
0.0	0.397574753414	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.397452072154	But if you place good ones, you pocket it.
0.0	0.19662882582	And I've been there.
0.0	0.363061858448	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.340291877136	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.415069794422	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.24009222949	We don't know anything about that.
0.0	0.371534241566	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.485589248185	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.364578268757	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.169811038433	You're right.
0.0	0.362821499944	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.391447176621	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.527038143634	hospital that needs to be improved and made better for them turned over to privatization.
0.0	0.400028918737	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.401588284325	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.497880181918	Ninety-three hours.
0.0	0.338188332343	And, they asked about her email situation.
0.0	0.201099006213	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.454572484159	I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.
0.0	0.590855998101	Number one...
0.0	0.553045129582	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.471621742673	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.274740120666	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.219726380353	And I believe he is absolutely right.
0.0	0.553916997772	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.401472992093	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.321375467354	But I said, "Don't hit Iraq," because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East.
0.0	0.314769953917	And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.
0.0	0.36217512885	They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.369934446902	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.354674858705	We saw that in Egypt.
0.0	0.25786850013	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.374134851139	Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.
0.0	0.521191850174	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.342495397903	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.422600417106	I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.
0.0	0.354071430876	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.511105197063	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.321050320939	I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.
0.0	0.23500448244	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.
0.0	0.212685616189	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.39676093121	... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.381981154531	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.305264402697	That's because we've put conservative policies in place.
0.0	0.108721029529	...
0.0	0.420415439819	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.503264843598	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.278328082768	It's great to be back.
0.0	0.236076419062	Everybody thought it was a done deal.
0.0	0.159147913544	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.310795289875	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.420022020961	Break them up.
0.0	0.470862612053	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.532386465618	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.442615225796	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
1.0	0.65362320502	It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.
0.0	0.520523631971	So there's more to my plan than just the cap.
0.0	0.234119570885	Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.
1.0	0.552921176875	Today, we have 272.
0.0	0.389092194286	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.235746965814	Nobody can do that like me.
0.0	0.596015978226	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.194551248114	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.47415078941	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.334080345895	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.424436217749	And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow.
0.0	0.310995338843	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.576417641219	We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations.
0.0	0.45245036225	And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.
0.0	0.378430740491	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.419651595666	This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.
0.0	0.394229326978	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.367371705069	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
0.0	0.479342472822	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.366817129574	And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
1.0	0.48211855989	But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.
0.0	0.356637252415	The American people are terrified.
0.0	0.33977508913	We were attacked from Afghanistan.
0.0	0.340538308199	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.574941967959	And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.
0.0	0.277877792819	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.449540600644	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.289660350273	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.313883925595	I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.
0.0	0.422411704362	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.370123813572	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.422021144455	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.684772244571	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.231069436657	We get a traitor.
0.0	0.32112491408	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.341137105943	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.377282912269	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.330438371654	My background is different.
0.0	0.344720002174	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.427887593429	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.412920810574	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.293197231273	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
0.0	0.332190622126	It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York.
0.0	0.344299820719	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.47183531639	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.267330953665	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
1.0	0.882809274646	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.393186052088	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.138107054049	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.329296720506	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.382367145174	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.314106068653	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.259552723356	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.408851319644	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.108721029529	How about this?
0.0	0.362193675948	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.476866105685	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.108721029529	That's it.
0.0	0.310459274894	And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party, but of President Obama.
0.0	0.322113748706	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.227601665969	You've heard some of those tonight.
1.0	0.465591559395	John -- John, this country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.349412899173	I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.
0.0	0.352535731346	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.351789259371	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.153608983129	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.337610965081	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.328792316302	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.38565038504	And we have people that are controlled by special interests.
0.0	0.288579683255	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.455685018553	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.365729333408	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.56462070582	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
0.0	0.376206914701	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.307214420833	You know, Ted didn't show up.
0.0	0.336985549941	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.262971184536	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.292981915364	I'd suggest people take a look at it.
0.0	0.310434444953	We need money.
0.0	0.409227190912	We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
0.0	0.351438428983	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.507429150021	When those buildings came down, she was trapped in her building and I didn't hear from her over six hours.
0.0	0.379182155307	But the facts are simple.
0.0	0.454516334933	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.106175361871	Yeah.
0.0	0.371700826251	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.401837949595	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.266654683729	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.295898231373	Let me respond...
0.0	0.464807187607	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.24832898548	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
0.0	0.361811094554	The formula is working.
0.0	0.345108610025	It's very important we operate on both at the same time.
0.0	0.272288325283	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.349478327279	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
0.0	0.369345596125	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.362392363167	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.480734984663	They should have made it more open ended for the next president.
0.0	0.271579566039	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.314512832099	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.311547594972	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.214917867052	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.273241892242	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.196060492934	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.213285436023	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.419481456903	And we ought to fight them on that level.
0.0	0.386859226786	The no-fly zone, I would hope, would be also shared by Russia.
0.0	0.388392518144	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.281155370061	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.254225515703	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.42823811982	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.331056406529	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.335765599314	Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted.
0.0	0.242529795473	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.207627614915	Go ahead.
0.0	0.407722820363	If I am elected president...
0.0	0.369927157891	As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe.
0.0	0.43620834347	The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.
0.0	0.461628550165	But there is a broad consensus on sensible gun safety regulations that I, coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, will do my best to bring together.
0.0	0.232005455277	So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
0.0	0.540491276089	First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster.
0.0	0.3181232482	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.126564408081	Yes.
0.0	0.207627614915	Go ahead.
0.0	0.402882749244	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.421535587358	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.25348179545	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.503331570054	The DNC has hired vendors.
0.0	0.406866287949	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.390451267223	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.164023235009	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.253179917379	And I think that's a mistake, and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways.
0.0	0.404430038872	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.348016664423	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.428274758741	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.357040340629	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.325574695863	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.268462314347	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.444161286079	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.388724377202	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.270473473192	They're a scam.
0.0	0.407501986636	Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.
0.0	0.313608160519	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.416854203495	And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting.
0.0	0.240525821899	I would not want to go to that point.
0.0	0.327656068223	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.307869501507	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.402698578234	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.239228096525	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.428002267746	It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
0.0	0.398207067672	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.254108505797	Those are your enemies.
0.0	0.322921658835	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.305759579273	So did you, Marco.
0.0	0.527552661364	In fact, if you remember, 50, 60 years ago, the University of California, City University of New York were virtually tuition-free.
0.0	0.321570985083	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.19519519901	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.392133496582	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.458089408536	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.468063426632	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.156217217732	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.496213090654	But it was also the cascading effects that followed that.
0.0	0.270357001069	Obama is going to be out playing golf.
0.0	0.381783675725	My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.
0.0	0.447145845933	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.260092603447	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.377477888175	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.31923975847	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.447640930124	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.352214420028	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.321246959829	Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.
0.0	0.344537334945	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.474289125906	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.221429975694	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.370316852531	There are a lot of factors involved in that.
0.0	0.121245837316	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.395775877806	I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States and literally around the world that there is a "clash of civilizations," that there is some kind of Western plot or even "war against Islam," which then I believe fans the flames of radicalization.
0.0	0.345476176535	I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.
0.0	0.421528380037	We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.363442343199	You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future.
0.0	0.284393585042	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
1.0	0.428972208153	Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion.
0.0	0.323248910061	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.372672568949	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.528501654341	And it has three parts.
0.0	0.470549244959	In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men.
0.0	0.438802733292	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.359525534534	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.44654566197	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.401502497822	And we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.
0.0	0.234162134365	Say again?
0.0	0.361411573663	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.351285329137	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.40678938341	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.380330634596	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.246208389947	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.305207906847	Your question was you have disagreed...
0.0	0.30145653586	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.258984606876	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.347291396692	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.143878671662	We can do that.
0.0	0.471909057387	That's what I said to my own public health people.
0.0	0.423837246329	And he asked me to support that.
0.0	0.33907636939	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.522890641404	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.294638635376	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.314615754479	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.255859003093	As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans.
0.0	0.543994606127	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.252384382201	I don't think we're at war with Islam.
0.0	0.396493981899	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
1.0	0.626523122373	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
0.0	0.126564408081	Yes.
0.0	0.359541444197	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
0.0	0.306309933938	it won't happen.
0.0	0.309506125312	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.496893905065	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.378174181903	It's become more complicated.
0.0	0.51437502248	But accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000.
0.0	0.323454382661	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.337085635198	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
1.0	0.448184845334	And some of them are like third world countries.
0.0	0.300401158499	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.431454494631	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.344771103372	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.108721029529	That is what we have to do.
0.0	0.346690828192	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.252350884417	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.190753445806	they expect to get something.
0.0	0.302311393484	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.126334574271	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.523722937464	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.286210315678	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.228692893653	We have the opposite thinking.
0.0	0.458036657409	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.436876395051	It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.
0.0	0.358669452136	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.304781681678	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.291359371122	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
0.0	0.405780512921	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.339071034432	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.454751790458	This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.
0.0	0.354074153055	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.397995316452	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?
0.0	0.380850665172	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.167933310347	I think I'm actually a very nice person."
0.0	0.461654370995	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.322191139115	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.247121347073	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.405223118261	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.210439365816	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.180201571535	That's kind of a no-brainer.
0.0	0.353672857244	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.39648663698	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.314574611999	And we do have a role in this.
1.0	0.578535440169	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.44145041165	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.531209695929	It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.234570527604	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.156250259019	But it will be...
0.0	0.204774394604	And that's not what's happening now.
0.0	0.489772593489	So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
0.0	0.318669150063	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.258376149693	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.440968843743	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.37085531532	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.430804206551	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.497505233581	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.393386403344	I was there and I saw the debate.
0.0	0.296640897936	He's very upset.
0.0	0.378600940536	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.261044035582	I've always listened to you, Megyn.
0.0	0.496017554756	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.344524615156	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.347301344493	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.39089166989	David, there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees.
0.0	0.365198756332	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.3888096265	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.25468900082	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.455427948882	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.343628971559	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.49622132526	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.389688934949	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.20836006842	I'm all about making sure we actually get results for whatever we do.
0.0	0.344354033292	Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.
0.0	0.309466587838	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.137034862642	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.386962946507	They come up to my office.
0.0	0.372250380061	I was the architect.
0.0	0.437567042188	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.404048106912	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.418597083965	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.377815794106	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.434630960588	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.294686308141	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.297643284024	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.373356167599	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.292784515556	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.374438343644	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
0.0	0.504088994316	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.36667271227	But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.
0.0	0.314910215925	The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.380509981793	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.235272786064	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.455378290526	And I applaud his record in Maryland.
0.0	0.34093056809	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.424520077692	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.480031602209	My name was invoked.
0.0	0.349552883439	And what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.331218023969	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.314107961885	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.
0.0	0.309071840764	How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
0.0	0.375525679423	Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild.
0.0	0.394368119681	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.570262112325	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.354698132298	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.422084516469	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
1.0	0.196738726797	They're rapists.
0.0	0.239095424802	But look, we didn't know what was happening next.
0.0	0.317262428761	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.360994941121	Big difference.
0.0	0.261896394238	You find me...
0.0	0.391506575538	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.580833801376	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.489525298156	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
0.0	0.490311313329	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.251785114211	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.47205689284	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
1.0	0.781667324216	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.174813898177	He'll say.
0.0	0.334545007842	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.
0.0	0.108721029529	No.
0.0	0.511698824198	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.353345638127	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...
0.0	0.310348596348	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.30268173369	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.39657126351	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.235898116686	Please think of our founding fathers as you listen.
0.0	0.497505233581	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.108721029529	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.291344980773	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.504986680948	But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
0.0	0.235510627438	If not, they can stay where they are.
0.0	0.396643559233	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.499066993824	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
1.0	0.546527164917	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.350898206782	John.
0.0	0.375860740689	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.438864048979	They went to the DNC quietly.
0.0	0.32352521745	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.557639646056	We reduced violent crime to 30-year lows.
0.0	0.198097780682	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.545498004054	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.500400260924	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.13810804585	Whoa.
0.0	0.552738332259	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.380938708872	I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
0.0	0.520225930172	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.268433709166	I need your help.
0.0	0.407323786476	We brought together legislation supported by the American Legion, the VFW, the DOD, Vietnam Vets, all of the veterans organizations, which was comprehensive.
0.0	0.429031341452	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.410524927475	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.243104383139	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.376521014922	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.319799660153	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.451409573852	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.352324655575	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.362740477449	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.440406548608	I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...
0.0	0.452458355077	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.229230212224	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.271772139978	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.285936692618	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.357541500091	This is revolutionary for education in America.
0.0	0.348254733568	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.390163644992	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.508415920067	People have been paying it for years.
0.0	0.403769863742	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.294453396068	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.429613418825	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.522530654223	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.375040939625	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.580450189436	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.472504064393	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
0.0	0.40159931451	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.31832271513	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.3375030522	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.39432475216	I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.
0.0	0.392191896018	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.421116794637	I mean, let's talk about this arc of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about.
0.0	0.491720195322	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.382882890867	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.136734816002	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.332113292935	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.363384909407	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
0.0	0.326931399066	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.345997200144	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.177488316595	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.305866319217	I know every one.
0.0	0.462185340288	The world has changed.
1.0	0.653651686134	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
0.0	0.242517166252	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.325716235763	Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem.
0.0	0.317242536772	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.320399124027	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.543357564874	Seventeen more million more people have health care.
0.0	0.424342242183	I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
0.0	0.460949784159	And she turned around many lives.
0.0	0.265672498691	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.407269439289	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.504073384848	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.41391233858	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.363021842359	Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take.
1.0	0.748799109923	Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.
0.0	0.437711149217	Since, you know, the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody.
0.0	0.387104121401	You are working at McDonald's?
1.0	0.617992138997	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.395563180919	Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.
0.0	0.134549034206	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.345507292792	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.397308477326	I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.144953811129	They're not good.
0.0	0.329682747269	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.288457776522	We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists.
0.0	0.269516199838	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.279856598325	They are ripping us.
0.0	0.366761543681	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.428092011986	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.414302670149	And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, "if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed.
0.0	0.312887303522	And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe.
0.0	0.338640406632	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.14650702805	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.409737320484	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.364050928939	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
0.0	0.458321022351	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.318798902891	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.361700872744	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.262681115019	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.392781758714	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
0.0	0.447539976606	I do not support amnesty...
0.0	0.504409159741	People were just being fined to death.
0.0	0.635984985374	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
0.0	0.412980659085	We are doing both at the same time.
0.0	0.261414373879	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.365755685425	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.537725830529	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.269318615098	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.308813452348	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.41011138444	When somebody is addicted and seeking help, they should not have to wait three, four months in order to get that help.
0.0	0.458353602664	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.43752469894	We also have to build a coalition at home.
0.0	0.344933970305	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.358464340475	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.296584037315	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.192222899428	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.418499951821	And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation.
0.0	0.495894850035	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.162427589991	I think he is right.
0.0	0.362670618057	I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.
0.0	0.409664491667	When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.
0.0	0.490496382767	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.31988452387	There's give and take.
0.0	0.449804511497	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.461915373978	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.332622931548	And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives.
0.0	0.407646207651	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.515717161719	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.433088561619	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.385477607299	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.351458817932	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.453011299854	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.316991283331	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.478080751187	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.357181491833	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
0.0	0.58653380821	To get deregulated -- listen to this, they spent $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions over a 10-year period.
0.0	0.350898206782	So was I, John.
0.0	0.402447540006	And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...
0.0	0.461709088613	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
1.0	0.684721715557	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.414194463514	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
0.0	0.373099262474	I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace.
0.0	0.543312710961	And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.
0.0	0.298956661961	They're sending us not the right people.
0.0	0.380900049391	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.337520397753	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.345487236783	Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.
0.0	0.438322418408	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.355978528389	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.304222415866	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.474382385508	And then on top of that, we've got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are pouring huge sums of money into super PACS heavily influencing the political process.
0.0	0.443090450029	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.46675491183	It has too much economic power.
0.0	0.395877548722	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.405761099477	First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.
0.0	0.40666380395	Germany, many other countries do it already.
0.0	0.379599415287	And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.
0.0	0.459965453106	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.0942409610085	You know why?
0.0	0.405373148962	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.390064715741	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.368375695695	Then, in 2008, you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying that we don't need those regulations on the federal level and now you're coming back around here.
0.0	0.266377819855	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.363762623369	I started off -- thank you -- I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said -- and I love my father.
0.0	0.483739653507	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.126564408081	Yes.
0.0	0.500358161944	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.504666751665	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.446702503565	... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region.
0.0	0.37451000006	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.426735022892	Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world.
0.0	0.137034862642	Think about it.
0.0	0.338485082736	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.370481158395	They kill us.
0.0	0.376509632194	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.482374774294	I'm one of the 77 percent.
0.0	0.57873403945	I sell apartments for -- I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.
0.0	0.424745714401	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.309114605386	And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.
0.0	0.165713582316	We got it.
0.0	0.443365678682	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.199561847257	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.22349478686	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.234972521014	... and I'd like to respond.
0.0	0.459719540189	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.372466292776	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
0.0	0.470453805342	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.389048552669	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.321009896729	That's the right of people.
0.0	0.597008536621	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.108721029529	...
0.0	0.479792692364	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.395179997854	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.468949576106	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
1.0	0.747061502857	When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.
0.0	0.328573348423	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.219450667544	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
1.0	0.757537029941	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
1.0	0.796648676185	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.341803674716	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.349276049322	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.
0.0	0.354828653971	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.394828895818	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
1.0	0.696684056782	Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.
0.0	0.202050042332	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.463910750687	May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care?
0.0	0.288988499583	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.362362677898	Why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want?
0.0	0.296185880189	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.343180754264	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.
0.0	0.589728707734	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.227833532665	I understand.
0.0	0.419542712313	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.497505010293	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.380237483481	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.444481012097	If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship.
0.0	0.343652806791	And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.504807003617	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.293507780981	We need to figure this out together.
0.0	0.28886314804	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.36111548605	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.286939548642	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.457713774703	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.376692698778	Again, with all do respect to Secretary Clinton...
0.0	0.447395100826	Why do -- why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major -- the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?
0.0	0.0942409610085	We know...
0.0	0.446640177629	According to the economists -- who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying -- that $24 trillion -- we're very close -- that's the point of no return.
0.0	0.286252950428	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.351000912195	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.225201560277	We get Bergdahl.
0.0	0.415188262407	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.328829950383	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.382391176018	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.455224414808	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.36733622159	You just can't do it.
0.0	0.388116351454	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
0.0	0.402466715949	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.368504522905	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.508914022234	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.598985622388	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.420471774495	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.369085469587	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.447130966826	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.356952303632	But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks."
0.0	0.403754070747	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.
0.0	0.252435876474	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.46156414119	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.221605389261	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.177827075628	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.435072216889	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.296388554016	We need security.
0.0	0.376921679504	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.285749434445	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.252788505097	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.280052142587	And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016.
0.0	0.481048742076	ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.
0.0	0.305301628765	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.273555503847	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.378173775346	No, what I would say is this is look, I was the first of the three of us to call for America to accept the 65,000 refugees we were asked to accept.
0.0	0.470847209113	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.46066234385	That's a drag on the economy.
0.0	0.17010478178	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.245906895936	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.133440261022	She was right.
0.0	0.272881599355	Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.
0.0	0.386532941891	You know where their United States headquarters is located?
0.0	0.279848731373	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.153063155659	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.310222658101	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.339225588965	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.379444512644	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.595138174909	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.314829495481	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.34730664776	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.0942409610085	And you know what?
0.0	0.398373682785	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.186132935938	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.338816033375	No, Martha, I would not.
0.0	0.292399336038	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.224700897281	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.405011506689	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.335873057522	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.309266393989	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
0.0	0.395495426318	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.303103989422	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.552497516389	Number one, there are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.108721029529	That's what it is.
0.0	0.335166155779	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.276017806281	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.480738936012	We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force.
0.0	0.218595343516	I just want a job.
0.0	0.324285190957	Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense.
0.0	0.346384882357	To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.
0.0	0.393713952276	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.373376793689	But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said.
0.0	0.108721029529	What should we do?
0.0	0.530134356207	Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.270080080627	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.363055426333	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.413560415892	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.288567309081	The answer is no.
0.0	0.52531915757	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.108721029529	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.287140806988	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.
0.0	0.478151814425	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.350592327162	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.367801387776	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.37407539807	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.401099251221	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.341801675433	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.617992138997	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.407000571154	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.313852984191	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.388040781053	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.447443266955	They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.
0.0	0.603333283578	You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56 percent, equivalent to 56 percent of the GDP In America.
0.0	0.413791924049	When he brought forward the "Gang of Eight" bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.
0.0	0.465224082079	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
1.0	0.663210333239	Very few children.
0.0	0.44198422393	It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.
0.0	0.328792316302	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.506802511593	When you ran in 2000, you said that we needed federal robust regulations.
0.0	0.53642575754	Tear down the EPA's blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates.
0.0	0.28547841431	We need much more than that.
0.0	0.412021202501	And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it.
0.0	0.108721029529	Again...
0.0	0.36828105987	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.108721029529	It is.
0.0	0.404487610096	So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.
0.0	0.303732541813	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.187216168324	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.265999792646	Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves.
0.0	0.422227028472	And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't.
0.0	0.186958082971	He was such a nice guy.
1.0	0.730061389475	I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance.
0.0	0.298663604945	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.455110402712	I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department.
0.0	0.261556181377	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.586659013473	Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts.
0.0	0.361138709099	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.
0.0	0.30672753232	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.455901073954	But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance.
0.0	0.351692892035	Who do you know will defend life, marriage and religious liberty?
0.0	0.241572995299	You know, this is not easy work.
0.0	0.3564715241	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.254024803638	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.279042223244	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.284922748036	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.547657861364	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.328789478235	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
0.0	0.462822626784	Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values.
0.0	0.45852106126	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.403613810211	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.341248680423	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.360514140726	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.229234554608	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.390181593443	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.346463437435	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.285633811099	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.108721029529	No.
0.0	0.148716706232	So be very, very careful.
0.0	0.478933212205	... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.
0.0	0.414224659997	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.353736257644	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.251566704116	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.424763129408	And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.
0.0	0.336486684602	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.309942686953	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.255439724423	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
1.0	0.653238718042	We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.
0.0	0.339222203352	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.196233577515	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.320273130585	They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.
0.0	0.406385234948	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.255599102338	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.253204022203	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.400547153261	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.544817208425	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
1.0	0.540281859624	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.394414784227	So -- because we got to make the country rich.
0.0	0.447135542599	That means medical.
0.0	0.231193913881	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
0.0	0.262870756228	Came out great.
0.0	0.311929657061	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.402268241981	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.
0.0	0.26869970359	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.449392561005	That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
1.0	0.722330613319	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.480416787992	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.277445854167	Let's be frank here.
0.0	0.421028218355	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.496467719267	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.414965781106	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.345179441682	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.279320134988	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.407432353368	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.487675880221	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.42389773257	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.358408468819	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.197512712074	Excuse me.
1.0	0.688517721457	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.393660188653	We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.
0.0	0.254886541278	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.351785781685	And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.277125899905	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.520932414516	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.346102773033	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.469338669144	Last point.
0.0	0.200533758442	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.420377753971	People have invested a lot of energy into that.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.545090131276	We only have one or two.
0.0	0.282555928325	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.354693174238	They don't even have a chance.
0.0	0.336772053338	We've been at this a couple of years.
0.0	0.478250731028	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.289693868561	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.441141587506	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.553882159602	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.324894427513	I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college.
0.0	0.437651140083	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.385399967876	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.334309321314	I want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, which they have not been doing.
0.0	0.364634719002	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.280695901031	She wants to pursue the American dream.
0.0	0.242157533925	I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...
0.0	0.314641087628	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.23234792478	Looking forward to it.
0.0	0.335085788858	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
0.0	0.421033159926	It's virtually useless.
0.0	0.680351743666	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.474910691211	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.37422811845	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.409491112287	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.391787632584	They're building up their military to a point that is very scary.
0.0	0.446102377796	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.286718218815	We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be -- and -- and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody.
0.0	0.426320935418	Or a young woman who had been performing at President Obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member.
0.0	0.284047284923	I said, "I don't need it.
0.0	0.669864335416	So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion.
0.0	0.379765586837	I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support.
0.0	0.443516016299	We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
0.0	0.478212137621	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.362841700217	We serve you.
0.0	0.425163794082	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
1.0	0.725002684803	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.441892015659	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.420296810824	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.436835224989	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.366914108154	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.0942409610085	But you know what?
0.0	0.282829214428	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.413435734945	And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.
0.0	0.454272290748	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.
0.0	0.445333511332	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.126564408081	Yes.
0.0	0.369440904447	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.535893704071	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.246427813175	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.352609578963	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.15473324091	It can happen.
0.0	0.433659497411	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
1.0	0.655379307229	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.46013098518	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.462802536988	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.421861369616	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.526100747256	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.545093864403	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.236435569579	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.38276087927	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
0.0	0.365212503898	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.251429383676	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.343186999823	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.404686933898	They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
0.0	0.317583789584	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.363090736456	He is a good man.
0.0	0.3513851739	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.180765892109	I agree with them.
0.0	0.316305099733	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.242279611016	I like them.
0.0	0.445410370569	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.470544790215	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.337647793247	Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president.
0.0	0.481641099267	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.280559512789	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.410720462091	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.343240750183	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.341510783298	It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.
0.0	0.264264214016	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.385815175803	And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
0.0	0.314062924222	It's not true.
0.0	0.314341832377	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.403025271124	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.591026696401	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
1.0	0.486550036951	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.298128023219	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.551526460474	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.361201418412	And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.
0.0	0.108721029529	We have to do it.
0.0	0.298329509406	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.322336582864	If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
0.0	0.385740956746	In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.489754811403	Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble.
0.0	0.299409632356	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.108721029529	So did you.
1.0	0.570250188802	$10.10 was all I could get the state to do by the time I left in my last year.
0.0	0.354612072737	Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.
0.0	0.38893787957	We need, basically, to pledge that we're going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.
0.0	0.187019473091	And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.
1.0	0.439172130554	It's never below zero.
0.0	0.337696677275	Thank you very, very much.
0.0	0.436791003028	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.33615540146	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.443812075491	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.392053695982	Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.
0.0	0.301401811107	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
1.0	0.727026456282	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.284718091245	We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.
1.0	0.679880681311	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.485392017396	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.369055995093	We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.
0.0	0.283297710008	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.600933871311	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.302544570377	So it is difficult.
0.0	0.429271776149	John, the world is a very dangerous place, but the world is not too dangerous of a place for the United States of America, provided we act according to our principles, provided we act intelligently.
0.0	0.31795219618	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.298902575166	David, let me give you a little bit of background here.
0.0	0.285899166026	Don't believe it.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.367801387776	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.210091514009	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.13810804585	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
0.0	0.459307725028	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.379078106562	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.400070977318	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.469517800221	We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate.
0.0	0.481238358284	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.215352425498	Absolutely.
0.0	0.313027612076	And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before.
0.0	0.386379804065	We went after those who had attacked us.
0.0	0.283058477832	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.169811038433	You're right.
0.0	0.372226372152	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.
0.0	0.360090850611	And we should be a welcoming nation.
0.0	0.428501032934	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.484127622532	You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super PAC and they're advertising against me in Iowa as we speak.
0.0	0.426668918543	By actually doing more for education.
0.0	0.293401170242	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.44645161044	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.288301864937	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.50653027836	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.419052788175	It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.444328281064	And for my part, I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has.
0.0	0.438438189139	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.590758090486	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.325084901424	I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.
1.0	0.381272982828	Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.
0.0	0.342368189894	They're going to take away thousands of jobs.
0.0	0.387795380283	We cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of moral nations around this Earth, we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats, because Martha, this will not be the last region where nation-states fail.
0.0	0.383741050136	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.380655500843	They started in Iowa.
0.0	0.429227523203	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.283031250099	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.
0.0	0.365856815693	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.345335698306	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.313995153243	Thank you, John.
0.0	0.234216269273	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.478110089468	Otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.
0.0	0.352786917074	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.187405179841	And that's what's happening.
0.0	0.567496074679	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.458803163718	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.337696677275	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.202544215141	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.259657599501	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.405214051355	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.321982924361	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.308664179478	I think that what we're facing with ISIS is especially complicated.
0.0	0.408791167334	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.336001055637	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.273467192789	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.391445501234	We don't eliminate Medicare.
0.0	0.342376020001	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.22384086212	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.342450667227	You don't serve us.
0.0	0.411401859852	So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income.
0.0	0.287550558331	Could I just say -- just say this...
0.0	0.304880604324	Hey, I have lobbyists.
0.0	0.320867523477	If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say?
0.0	0.534627055613	I never said that.
0.0	0.383941717942	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
0.0	0.306968437987	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.490929591542	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
1.0	0.661782318829	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.449650412009	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.422623421763	So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act.
0.0	0.284023159177	We're ready to start shooting."
0.0	0.372351431317	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.28002838951	No interest," because I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.403287569462	We have losers.
0.0	0.398801459235	And I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern.
0.0	0.411268315185	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.411573677144	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.3806731233	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.410379691234	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.187142360134	Now they're going militarily.
0.0	0.352467126942	We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?
0.0	0.358602418349	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.52490144316	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
0.0	0.528451618886	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.385495502979	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.453283437294	I've employed -- I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
0.0	0.382322817102	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.246084287503	... What was your question...
0.0	0.198552799405	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.462147124392	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.263871923876	That is important.
0.0	0.391179694398	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
0.0	0.284344581837	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.
0.0	0.506728118029	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.296939072448	I said, "I gotta go into Manhattan.
1.0	0.425527984661	In 1988, I lost an election because I said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of America.
0.0	0.523612160168	And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.314897893021	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.334546732534	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.312864904437	We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression.
0.0	0.529416223126	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.346086437242	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.42969527575	You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.
0.0	0.351378659944	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.652280359512	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.215352425498	Absolutely.
0.0	0.23014879899	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
1.0	0.473535387403	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.570146195184	My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.330872501925	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.33613947911	There are a lot of things we've got to do in our country, reigning in Wall Street is certainly one of them.
0.0	0.389172757711	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.433321115838	When was the last time you heard China is killing us?
0.0	0.348810719325	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
0.0	0.252045931872	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.345979814932	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.493176010921	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.303485565824	I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail.
0.0	0.430570062221	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.
0.0	0.588847028667	Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system.
0.0	0.383485696916	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
0.0	0.354220624007	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.
0.0	0.303389258619	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.349979734247	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.22718599965	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
0.0	0.242062441967	I said, "I don't know."
0.0	0.37062891073	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.422861891149	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.354621379012	As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election.
0.0	0.435334134072	I believe that our Federal Government needs to do more on pell grants.
0.0	0.438195305546	And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.302914491089	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.103910289588	OK.
0.0	0.521464105867	First of all...
0.0	0.312732312002	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.576740872431	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.43178708627	I think that is the number one requirement.
0.0	0.424727246378	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.348092575407	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.377237555021	They want American troops back in the Middle East.
0.0	0.494275596445	I changed that.
1.0	0.877386395466	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.310391752194	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.541423011068	They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
0.0	0.478667298937	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.367661968896	When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.
0.0	0.321521686913	We offered a lot more.
0.0	0.334038043511	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.231090081003	I am glad Donald is running.
0.0	0.605550020757	If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.
0.0	0.44855232632	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.431850971587	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.51541295081	Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military.
0.0	0.142344093337	I'm getting to that.
0.0	0.482927875033	But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks.
0.0	0.394554512662	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.396063846236	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.398305211253	Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.
0.0	0.343058771015	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.393863086861	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.557416517129	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.133440261022	That's right.
0.0	0.466345906396	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.210154309909	And you have to really work hard at it.
0.0	0.393690462903	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.63329081467	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.431930664934	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.405596217993	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.43790485121	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
1.0	0.572267284679	And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
0.0	0.428123870959	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.147037422084	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.409991347727	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.376699064089	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.37148065444	Today I heard it.
0.0	0.456282210214	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.401318598867	And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.
0.0	0.211784236701	I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is.
0.0	0.304409758382	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.3134345625	They will not bring us -- believe me -- to the promised land.
0.0	0.529508586605	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.394582552977	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.
0.0	0.426844171547	It's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement.
0.0	0.242869353952	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.437591094888	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.179002218249	That's for sure.
0.0	0.330939718306	So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again.
0.0	0.41367340312	When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it.
0.0	0.259051521978	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.536761484433	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.334781336151	I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out.
0.0	0.328685877092	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.26321827594	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.347865884135	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.519983941424	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.386904103673	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.461343055101	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.274226106622	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.438363837949	Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.
0.0	0.365735821793	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.345842619325	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.378323083942	It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably -- probably -- from the Middle East.
0.0	0.285285504244	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.369035162938	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.392065174325	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.366613295477	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.378613691983	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.359542061427	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.188112336927	We need that thinking.
0.0	0.335746917945	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.425193566107	On January 20th, 2017, the next president of the United States will walk into the White House.
0.0	0.336535074201	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.293774548359	We actually did it.
0.0	0.47207520652	There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction.
0.0	0.483971367016	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.421028218355	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.486436376122	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.600098820599	I want the Buffett Rule to be in effect, where millionaires have to pay 30 percent tax rates instead of 10 percent to nothing in some cases.
0.0	0.209038291523	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.340592360032	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
0.0	0.33591739639	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
1.0	0.516619312384	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.294936157342	And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage.
0.0	0.387777581296	And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.
0.0	0.385133123731	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.39128931711	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.462568893629	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.427448649411	Kathie, this was not merely theory in Maryland.
0.0	0.467105934334	And so do I.
0.0	0.444615919507	Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors.
0.0	0.247142598377	We want to build on it and fix it.
0.0	0.401536976014	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.352119144955	Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.
0.0	0.276237685807	Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth.
0.0	0.431114223292	As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.
0.0	0.313813251515	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.521464105867	First of all...
0.0	0.33700126958	So the fact is that we work for the people.
0.0	0.348854666823	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.403777682584	That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable.
0.0	0.387717221525	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.417611420111	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.312674998555	Like, I'm standing here, I -- I watched the video of Senator Cruz.
0.0	0.454009464616	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.353983678632	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.503959680764	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.108721029529	Have to do it.
0.0	0.337363948514	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.278830262117	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.35868366564	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.358735767493	I believe that the goal should be debt-free college.
0.0	0.257602015245	Because a lot of people said, "He'll never run.
0.0	0.302923604011	Wait a minute.
0.0	0.481989189193	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.341155923063	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.443395358672	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
0.0	0.327374143275	Donald Trump, for example -- I'm glad -- I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him...
0.0	0.425730473515	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.368980352299	Well, we're going to have to redo the way the prescription drug industry does business.
0.0	0.335490147575	I think the times are different now.
1.0	0.562802152963	The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.
0.0	0.295026029585	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.185708911806	You know, the situation is this.
0.0	0.472300417453	Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server.
0.0	0.356611515504	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.456389291493	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.422611528404	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.470054364528	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.307303147818	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.
0.0	0.333375346149	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.285101215988	I'm running for president, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people.
0.0	0.397702324593	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.

0.0	0.184309447207	That's who I'm indebted to.
1.0	0.480631591517	The truth of the matter is, net immigration from Mexico last year was zero.
0.0	0.440465545232	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.600058733236	As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.406319426208	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.377867990099	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.398695549972	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.39939034849	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.329834894211	They've been beaten into submission.
1.0	0.417529714551	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.595428316879	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.477685233081	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.326906580219	We'll be filing it right on time.
0.0	0.364119319635	What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.
0.0	0.530532692981	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.370791363322	At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida.
0.0	0.360457106693	I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism --
0.0	0.412791156819	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.386190804692	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.108721029529	But...
0.0	0.448059442502	That's the wrong number.
0.0	0.489653884687	It wasn't the bill that I wanted, but yet it turned out to be one of the more significant pieces of veterans' legislation passed in recent history.
0.0	0.312017245964	I kind of miss Donald Trump.
0.0	0.445422412251	... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.298290079521	I would change them.
0.0	0.305865278963	Maria...
0.0	0.413199333993	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.219497839511	Oh, great.
0.0	0.23951826118	You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now -- it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run.
0.0	0.294355684707	Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope.
0.0	0.355063294687	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.252600519866	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.490276635566	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.498586663224	Now, this takes, David, 18 months to 24 months, two years.
0.0	0.47709002254	That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.
0.0	0.33493329629	Well, you've got to be on top of it right away.
0.0	0.354053178963	When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.
0.0	0.2818693497	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.473887549288	I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border."
0.0	0.108721029529	Why is that?
0.0	0.442660401475	They all have jobs.
0.0	0.355239770732	One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this, is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations.
0.0	0.33769740174	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.32196181722	slot.
0.0	0.246910982246	That's crony capitalism.
0.0	0.372019095212	I am the son and grandson of immigrants.
0.0	0.381441807984	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.463258354991	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.214722292152	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.491040225333	Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.
0.0	0.245901719569	Yes, let's tell the truth, Martin.
0.0	0.512066630701	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.426002925559	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.347274641777	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.337682808112	I know that because I buy the product."
0.0	0.388292047406	I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.
0.0	0.361889925282	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.196154209895	...No, sir...
0.0	0.108721029529	No, no.
0.0	0.241349517684	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.353129714588	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.330366020183	It's what they call it.
0.0	0.498323362643	We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.
0.0	0.286765640837	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.300587114936	The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.
0.0	0.406612479858	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.302232868384	But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue -- requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.262074719052	That's just media stuff.
0.0	0.369915250408	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.588534132561	to save a company.
0.0	0.405746988137	Check it out.
0.0	0.414543194163	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
1.0	0.641134490381	In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.
0.0	0.515928210294	And so, look, the way that -- a stronger middle class is actually the source of economic growth.
0.0	0.343908033852	When you come back to me, I'll share that story.
0.0	0.24470403785	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.596418797096	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.332499997737	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.31784973564	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.321085995351	Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.574970953878	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.472575758491	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.361828932546	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.340270504955	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.390416300537	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
0.0	0.370445178541	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.427691876902	At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically.
1.0	0.689730079767	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.491600225163	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.338118943846	I've prosecuted terrorists.
0.0	0.364398481504	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.301241355301	The problem is...
0.0	0.300052650966	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.487192445369	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.354571623722	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.425663016699	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.324526005791	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.270457943392	I love China.
0.0	0.322396573281	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.240678368263	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.317998207785	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.579544120367	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.286873998754	We need to define the enemy.
0.0	0.363402410344	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.243854611226	...before I go.
0.0	0.391474210202	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.215352425498	Absolutely.
0.0	0.345541695905	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.346653362517	They beat us all the time.
0.0	0.389373379447	Social Security, which Republicans call a Ponzi scheme, may face privatization.
0.0	0.362337089877	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.386671949838	When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal?
0.0	0.404511238915	We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love -- they're great -- all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.
0.0	0.312794911906	Syria is a mess.
0.0	0.570829113358	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.239754451146	I don't think so.
0.0	0.319924589678	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.337338918337	Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.313423354594	Well, there are so many, I don't know where to start.
0.0	0.268527892398	We're going to create a border.

0.0	0.412090148176	So I said (ph), "No, that's the wrong number.
0.0	0.387274240035	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
1.0	0.50586424377	We passed it after 9/11.
0.0	0.399051261568	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.157423879419	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.345825071288	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.45342079281	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.422032162846	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.298016157546	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.364361533543	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.108721029529	What do we do?
0.0	0.398619060239	He has never defended...
0.0	0.436145294847	I do respect Rand.
0.0	0.411134898241	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.378625167689	It's great to be at Trump Tower.
0.0	0.540887735262	You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.

0.0	0.32406343339	You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.
0.0	0.47091421273	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.

0.0	0.219266727403	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.

0.0	0.344813159515	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
0.0	0.380849242665	We lose on trade.

0.0	0.315942261123	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.446173373827	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.263247516286	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
0.0	0.398670504111	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.
0.0	0.217331688128	We're running.
0.0	0.411853360828	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.385565884149	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.545381111092	Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs.
0.0	0.396991173144	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.262110488571	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.354588559873	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.397054293452	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
0.0	0.426398239969	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.
0.0	0.224048778111	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.280228706874	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.195719617983	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.388782112971	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
0.0	0.387342392441	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.

0.0	0.339240769751	And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.
0.0	0.4036586351	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.437255630357	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.
0.0	0.378848394087	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.395922304938	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.

0.0	0.330872501925	Don't do it."
0.0	0.29802390676	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.385452004817	First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.419978736176	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.405603614436	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.341221208672	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.403462637116	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.431659391473	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.404079949385	I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.
0.0	0.343969139222	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.49295510881	Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago.
0.0	0.303727328508	They blow people up.
0.0	0.374233680752	And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.
0.0	0.431798304993	What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people.
0.0	0.417393201117	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.399556351938	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.338792516314	That's when we become Greece.
0.0	0.354189744987	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.50234401541	Major crisis and primary health care.
0.0	0.20357055582	Wait for what?
0.0	0.312969429015	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.297845894583	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.51341624764	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.278552691376	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.344835264161	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.467985534973	Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country.
0.0	0.640090295363	Do the $12 and you would index it.
0.0	0.528410961353	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.288418002949	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.405097784731	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.41039152178	We are at war with violent extremism.
0.0	0.355024486538	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.413192861444	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.411804738049	Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization called ISIS.
0.0	0.214801695324	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.475060215071	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.291014607442	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.313045316453	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.280011581906	And, look, there are profound differences...
0.0	0.342666010472	He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
0.0	0.372611921148	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.238178775948	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.235401695856	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.222077583576	They don't know how to bring it about.
0.0	0.29638341369	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.387305186112	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
0.0	0.108721029529	No -- no...
0.0	0.396826799889	By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa.
0.0	0.384532891504	Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable?
0.0	0.154194209843	Alright.
0.0	0.393640124884	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.
0.0	0.309331214863	Our vets may see the V.A.
0.0	0.375685145913	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.214361225628	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.361549333967	But he used to say, "Donald, don't go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.334099055555	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.287257359666	Well, I just think you're asking a question with a false choice.
0.0	0.133440261022	All right.
0.0	0.4134841119	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.279938895222	They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn.
0.0	0.323705639332	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.613219204466	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
0.0	0.424524605354	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.377394334666	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.493543916211	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.364777760079	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.
0.0	0.463443891412	We have to do away with the strawman proposal.
0.0	0.249053678208	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.413633295872	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.427326367709	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.33057372309	Good company.... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in -- and I wouldn't even use -- you know, I have -- I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
0.0	0.616019263665	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.408011362022	Well, David, I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country.
0.0	0.404629237559	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.292510894115	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.363689506479	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.328930442774	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.210910968026	Well, sure.
0.0	0.38109731691	And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.
0.0	0.41789780839	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.37946412646	We saw a dictator overthrown.
1.0	0.675343096733	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.413453753952	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.611538707902	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.306353488067	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.
0.0	0.335588981916	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.234162134365	And before I say it, I have to say this.
0.0	0.403933221573	Got to go to Haiti last year.
0.0	0.366873862388	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.404712709898	Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country.
0.0	0.333346493124	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.430482872953	But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone.
0.0	0.334374263472	I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries.
0.0	0.21057227218	And they're all over the place.
0.0	0.452931107519	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.231357250672	I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.
0.0	0.520499033364	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.376805249109	But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country.
0.0	0.353497391228	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.441680702949	First of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy, as you've indicated.
0.0	0.413459022525	The intelligence was by no means absolute.
0.0	0.242345102347	We know about the French.
0.0	0.219829394024	I want a job."
0.0	0.108721029529	You do.
0.0	0.439532810818	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.273084228077	You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America.
0.0	0.316385267153	I say, "That's a terrible story.
0.0	0.372956993542	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.352425732324	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.318341785848	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.
0.0	0.320563750637	He's a bad negotiator.
0.0	0.0942409610085	They know.
0.0	0.289727743327	Well, thank you, John.
0.0	0.439596770018	Do I take the product?
1.0	0.518270920903	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.213153891486	And it's an honor to have everybody here.
0.0	0.292124488295	And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?
0.0	0.387184819978	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.461718915044	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.32758735121	Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.386899595541	But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future.
0.0	0.43350066211	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.50468862757	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.412556402679	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
0.0	0.370356258586	I do agree that in particular, Turkey and the Gulf nations have got to make up their minds.
0.0	0.333440203352	You can't be in favor of defend us...
0.0	0.133440261022	That's right.
0.0	0.435128971586	In the 1980s, it was in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Reagan's administration, and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel, and others were murdered.
0.0	0.337468790179	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.438350500693	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.439515639941	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.343455675308	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
0.0	0.32388296147	We can't do it.
0.0	0.334405166738	I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.
0.0	0.404121973416	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.43570353942	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.210706955304	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.230104323507	It's hate action.

0.0	0.260086658694	That is a pledge that I'm making.
1.0	0.608040555952	7 percent and 8 percent to go to college?
0.0	0.405143776831	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.382071548175	If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences.
0.0	0.393771025675	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.259728088906	They all want me to support them.
0.0	0.353671632203	Dynamically.
0.0	0.436678913469	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.473558792152	That's my bill.
0.0	0.537137648356	He's been a negative force.
0.0	0.361048650129	It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them.
0.0	0.472833860968	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.339805631457	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.435982954079	What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the Muslim nations in that region who are going to have to fight and defend their way of life.
0.0	0.461440001284	That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.
0.0	0.472761734353	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.271263642299	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.267264147775	And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.
0.0	0.248145189975	When I'm president, that will change.
0.0	0.405598456752	I was recruited to H.P.

0.0	0.201995196561	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.321679142373	John, may I -- may I interject here?
0.0	0.526479389561	On two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago.
0.0	0.447743160592	For over 200 years, America's light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again.
0.0	0.337459986948	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.440733111083	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.296787955208	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.396810928067	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
0.0	0.495840785427	It's a disaster.
0.0	0.417115773745	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.349004587466	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.262996777836	And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.
0.0	0.338692278279	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.44667257149	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.338219898182	They like to ask direct questions.
0.0	0.228958428075	I agree completely.
0.0	0.394638391801	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.

0.0	0.376636210345	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
0.0	0.312547521778	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.396014743612	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.

0.0	0.242730798054	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.420787320696	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.44718842574	It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English.
0.0	0.477410392252	... and 85 percent of gun owners agree.
0.0	0.293197994731	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
0.0	0.108721029529	No.
0.0	0.34265663787	A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this.
0.0	0.420437200963	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.425919310906	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.648659516368	$2.5 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world.
0.0	0.432532165042	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.537219271971	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.324954229956	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.538894421521	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.218628967339	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.
0.0	0.270474673238	You can go to my website...
0.0	0.133440261022	Right.
0.0	0.364182728404	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.426719405526	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.373561926827	You know, we had this incident before, Secretary, with your famous e-mails.
0.0	0.420038948389	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
0.0	0.322920571999	I didn't know I had so much power.
0.0	0.370160764405	Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens.
0.0	0.46175851108	It was the most highly sought after -- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
0.0	0.366410097055	... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before.
0.0	0.199545530524	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.328750859695	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.368069889675	They won't accept it.
0.0	0.557009858923	It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military.
0.0	0.250133978938	We've gotten off the Hillary's e-mails, good.
0.0	0.463440153878	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.353995299766	And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.
0.0	0.295869145899	I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie.
0.0	0.351710619966	We're going to cut costs.

0.0	0.50601053941	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.544269733084	And that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums.
0.0	0.474529577287	What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.108721029529	Why is it...
0.0	0.298220457902	They don't have a clue.
0.0	0.327311757758	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.371691154953	But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here.
0.0	0.363358946521	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
0.0	0.280071828546	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.409858888632	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.409071661427	And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.
0.0	0.383559925509	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.292218426764	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.377654445536	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.4456506743	The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.
0.0	0.314896213007	So, your original question is the right question.
0.0	0.454980851819	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.366919763318	Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that's not good enough.
0.0	0.318666378532	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.421623719027	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.144953811129	But they're not good.
0.0	0.126564408081	Yes.
0.0	0.192222899428	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.409449434972	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.293834278201	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.315717606256	But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
0.0	0.210294107913	Please reconsider, I'll say no.
0.0	0.445397424569	The nature of warfare has changed.
0.0	0.348924279067	I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s.
0.0	0.298734666097	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.390797096778	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.447818158747	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.330914538377	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.353237507347	(inaudible).
0.0	0.108721029529	...
0.0	0.238594906188	So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.
0.0	0.506198841117	Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care.
0.0	0.422949020712	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.296438547491	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.233079780342	And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a -- that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.
1.0	0.326795754712	They're bringing drugs.
0.0	0.34197995833	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.329647929752	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.406353276704	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.578967232544	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.306833690089	We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.
0.0	0.344763864876	Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy.
0.0	0.311637437625	Everybody got out -- and they kept our equipment.
0.0	0.638558338988	They make a billion dollars a day.
0.0	0.380500140452	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.343898354329	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.37992636579	Jeb, please attack Ted..."
0.0	0.134136062085	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.479641827734	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.133440261022	Right.
0.0	0.563700911771	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.290175180861	Look, I served on...
0.0	0.364311067597	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.419288063441	In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...
0.0	0.381593836838	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.392341255661	They will be our early warning signal.
1.0	0.429039470898	I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded.
0.0	0.174813898177	I'll say this.
0.0	0.337865156716	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.341419195846	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.221119888092	How are we gonna -- how are we gonna go back and make it great again?
0.0	0.444249280151	I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.
0.0	0.308641686047	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.51322365986	You lead and you produce results.
1.0	0.826778988608	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.262925500955	You looking at me?
0.0	0.327674365373	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.575013615438	It is not because of the tax writeoff.
0.0	0.108721029529	No.
0.0	0.320606227294	Neil?
0.0	0.458461547822	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.341850262228	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.449200334982	We have to go after what is called the shadow banking industry.
0.0	0.261480171267	Listen, we can solve immigration.
0.0	0.42832658869	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.272370689113	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.3233102232	David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave.
0.0	0.388625174745	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.436494592	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
0.0	0.328349229224	Bigger than that?
0.0	0.439411229975	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.434893055533	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.309986555591	They are going to have to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.498096692922	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.404959286397	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.126564408081	Yes.
0.0	0.337696677275	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.549178683902	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.391088623181	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.453168857526	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.212309523413	Great.
0.0	0.346710546671	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.308934552082	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.539163095884	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
0.0	0.429646652524	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
1.0	0.470149992559	They just built a hotel in Syria.
0.0	0.472783231246	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.17886675704	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.243600391611	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.26791452626	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.555123453514	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.228176992511	I don't think it's gonna happen.
0.0	0.437500797142	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
1.0	0.679496794997	And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph).
0.0	0.419649116145	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.379134381685	That means education.
0.0	0.33645230761	But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.
0.0	0.285311247437	Now, it's very interesting.
0.0	0.467121616672	Support community banks and credit unions.
0.0	0.471111050627	It is ISIS.
0.0	0.386020096503	So let's move toward what we should be doing as a nation and follow the values of our immigration history and begin to make it possible for them to come out of the shadows and to have a future that gives them a full chance of citizenship.

0.0	0.417097843881	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.194280632195	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.
0.0	0.455175310324	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.539478484866	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.507222731719	I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.
0.0	0.380340782113	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.292784515556	But let's be clear.
0.0	0.268945940508	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.614828391391	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.447799606367	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.11820028058	Now I'm not doing that...I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?
0.0	0.490667891067	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.385146009198	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.457748587342	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.330090301522	I think the issue here is -- and I applaud Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.501530414939	When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.
0.0	0.45854330125	That is our government today.
0.0	0.458945624264	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
0.0	0.522439994348	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.688551420632	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.283067026745	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.262472148611	He didn't know.
0.0	0.27539686801	I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.
0.0	0.598950632981	Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978.
0.0	0.235246067374	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.443996938849	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
0.0	0.264264214016	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.392457929646	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.451057176472	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.222677563204	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.
0.0	0.274536765699	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.
0.0	0.586967124551	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.32255000112	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.388445611807	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.413641724139	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.420809465671	In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, "Donald, you don't have enough borrowings.
0.0	0.285220704512	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.54136746275	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.3775708308	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.23263046337	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.421315614455	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.
0.0	0.462748903833	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.304542868355	Let me give you the bad news.
0.0	0.443125968929	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.437164964505	A military island.
0.0	0.244654138954	You want to know what carpet bombing is?
0.0	0.451337491273	... that's the -- that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration.
0.0	0.463953038902	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.556712399217	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.416652109544	The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign.
0.0	0.123373722149	And there's a lot.
0.0	0.408695722532	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.289177428027	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.262561369367	It goes away.
0.0	0.386661182112	I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.
0.0	0.346256197929	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.153207100857	They're not so stupid.
0.0	0.231381168629	But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
0.0	0.430066104478	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.477878175694	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.317720855138	I'm not using the lobbyists.
0.0	0.438192280256	It is not a barbed wire fence.
0.0	0.504942974678	That's the secondary issue.
0.0	0.478858146469	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.
1.0	0.48854453119	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.465515973891	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.17886675704	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.301241355301	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.331767741036	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.
0.0	0.16398318229	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.403161990102	I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country.
0.0	0.594919777083	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.389982764174	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.399015915606	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
1.0	0.621549358883	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.448028180862	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
0.0	0.268568621519	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.283891817971	There won't be any -- you can get it.
0.0	0.411258532031	They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.
0.0	0.439245264474	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.
0.0	0.401907680002	In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill, "Well I assume Hillary has told you about this."
0.0	0.349857341936	I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.
0.0	0.388837218132	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.361186157622	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.
0.0	0.239754451146	No, I don't think so.
0.0	0.351163480457	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.263740667004	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.383307790215	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.381901382567	Ask Boeing.
0.0	0.354776125199	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.394873141608	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.419627289334	And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.
0.0	0.30259823966	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.346253501376	You are not our adversary, you are our partner.
0.0	0.27913055081	If they want to accept our values and our laws.
0.0	0.310691418646	They've advertised that.
0.0	0.32823459307	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.108721029529	It was...
0.0	0.133440261022	That is not right.
0.0	0.212947483937	It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee.
0.0	0.421436347479	And we have to do more to prevent the flood of foreign fighters that have gone to Syria, especially the ones with western passports, that come back.
0.0	0.383672131926	KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.
0.0	0.327187132299	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
1.0	0.42869470935	When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.244931293799	Let's...
0.0	0.389382044455	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.486028436586	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.392836988384	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.372173947864	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.219541494548	We're dying.
0.0	0.364188711031	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.32127371346	It will give hope to millions of young people.
0.0	0.346539268557	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.314681970561	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.340415675572	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.325612701959	We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America.
0.0	0.108721029529	No, I have not.
0.0	0.429600260529	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.342021229547	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.399164246486	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.456774803112	We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
0.0	0.451451148642	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.355101401065	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.379256336428	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.389372742124	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.283763910816	So, yes, I did know people.
0.0	0.419393075493	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.103910289588	OK?
0.0	0.287605997553	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.408372167215	They;re gone.
0.0	0.436210040218	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.264709427757	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.457833358111	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.137034862642	They think they are.
0.0	0.402962752389	And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
0.0	0.268682995568	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.30401176661	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.292993419912	Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody.
0.0	0.314062924222	No, it's true.
0.0	0.306309933938	It won't happen.
0.0	0.494027993874	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.212309523413	How great is that?
0.0	0.331816608363	Revolution never came.
1.0	0.53849417283	2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.
0.0	0.361700666166	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.179002218249	Sure.
0.0	0.354519430775	There has never been a jihadist group like this.
0.0	0.429810681122	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.392788575376	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.296292836245	Thank you, Marco.
0.0	0.274074406295	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.437274146566	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.398154959389	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.144483059658	I'm proud of my family.
0.0	0.210536108436	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.330389338968	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.46415128563	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.276075668027	We need to stop that.
1.0	0.670068491422	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
0.0	0.4031457774	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.457379935188	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.250676738265	I've done an amazing job.
0.0	0.388987577035	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.
0.0	0.364558635744	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.495370186977	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.34552560305	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.420404117663	He's not a leader.
0.0	0.352573656513	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.463784402852	And if they have to be in the Middle East for 20 or 30 years no problem.
0.0	0.268732990832	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.266335148539	They've got nothing but money.
0.0	0.273333288197	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.396068138239	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.592370279525	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.325572560864	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.284699891455	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.428766270496	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.332905035591	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.
0.0	0.263881181292	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.380571652004	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.353503749488	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
1.0	0.757690884637	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.362116563365	And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition.
0.0	0.222471572732	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.534973061999	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.144716895216	And guess what?
0.0	0.511091150514	States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government.
0.0	0.326914115714	I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House.
0.0	0.368040770164	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.353574282132	But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.
0.0	0.291552004285	You get together.
0.0	0.339465882691	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.443713681817	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.337836962906	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.329566257072	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.438526811871	We are already de-conflicting air space.
0.0	0.397722732264	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.373476502376	So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe.
0.0	0.326962073038	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.446314314901	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.390018871576	For her convenience.
0.0	0.303527749145	But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding.
0.0	0.434875310895	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.305264769657	It's called the politics.
0.0	0.630494959865	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.427400390974	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
1.0	0.378579784399	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.354733555999	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.326810992855	... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do.
0.0	0.45546228875	Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, who said my plan for what we should do to reign in Wall Street was more comprehensive and better.
0.0	0.464163150511	And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.
0.0	0.415171457521	I've had had two town halls, one in Keene, one in Laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do.
0.0	0.330471749885	That's the difference.
0.0	0.534583696271	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.273890641073	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.333337274279	And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China.
0.0	0.259226473444	And, we said no.
0.0	0.315345129846	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.238434736708	We did a lot to help.

0.0	0.296433907061	Reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.343337991111	But we have a serious problem.
1.0	0.739097002791	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.483671968021	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...
0.0	0.257973820046	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.274623328369	Let me just -- let me just...

0.0	0.440659606747	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.384750596675	This is a complicated issue.
0.0	0.194274264656	You get a lot of them that are overrated.

0.0	0.320582961813	This is a terribly complicated issue.
0.0	0.369628487548	And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.208777245275	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.48629887022	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.

0.0	0.326685716326	These are very, very real issues.
0.0	0.36889404275	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.274067345263	So I've watched the politicians.
0.0	0.350376589976	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.274203754796	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.40532254369	Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.
0.0	0.303662216979	...Chris...
0.0	0.299960588437	I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen.
0.0	0.269108437999	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.418208755773	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.454012835832	We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is.
0.0	0.338115400862	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.346712513373	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.488274697651	I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
0.0	0.545795817604	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.405148376021	So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.
0.0	0.108721029529	But...
0.0	0.315857892593	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.454437460417	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
1.0	0.49440695275	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.405640542778	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.305426097122	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.365288026846	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.370651748085	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.376013190646	As president, I will support law enforcement and we'll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community.
0.0	0.507469490795	Two weeks later, the place was blown up.
0.0	0.271235805542	I want to thank the people of Iowa for being so welcoming to me.
1.0	0.713066190398	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.370282691887	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.4461018838	They serve in the military.
0.0	0.285558489698	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.384784781593	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.460917212734	Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.
0.0	0.440349543748	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
1.0	0.730426990088	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.487631276555	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.358961016769	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.417684342812	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.440758485953	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.345645036057	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.401706550373	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
1.0	0.795766099407	In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.
0.0	0.283082933736	And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.
0.0	0.132624520149	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.352661135283	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.108721029529	I have...
0.0	0.223846658339	I will be ready.
1.0	0.758343938709	And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.
0.0	0.161377359314	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.482272566232	And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.
0.0	0.480572515791	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.32692455927	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.385997404188	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.413164406558	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.36739693821	... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.156250259019	I will...

0.0	0.486945799187	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.437551159918	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.488612374716	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.448951698503	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.346012184313	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.18837917751	Am I supposed to dislike them?
1.0	0.580140737594	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.392039164501	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.494217235016	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
1.0	0.604570669858	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.401328839391	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.29947792731	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.403927718917	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.

0.0	0.234380167996	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.617503859431	But you would index it -- you would index it to the median wage.
0.0	0.344255950498	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.301773481013	They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).
0.0	0.47160618071	But I would add this.
0.0	0.589441625897	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.448844800759	Illegal.
0.0	0.3185102357	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.
0.0	0.367548696337	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.403326711145	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.405710147193	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.46233841216	And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.
0.0	0.380433112828	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.728499970675	...10% flat rate...

0.0	0.458544680073	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.373793389067	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.
0.0	0.420972934634	Are you not running?
0.0	0.469085375935	Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it.
0.0	0.404624260613	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.

0.0	0.457469279732	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
0.0	0.311269023464	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
0.0	0.36874459962	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.339177692651	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.357403101451	I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.

0.0	0.466140981674	Their business model is greed and fraud.
0.0	0.386148460698	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
0.0	0.405665977883	You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?

0.0	0.431178605367	We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.
0.0	0.333016986483	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?

0.0	0.488282023585	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.

1.0	0.653953092249	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.369714642249	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.324572246219	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.

0.0	0.316385579089	Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process.

0.0	0.40289254099	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.357372879418	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.30405008675	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.350860278347	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.405834195406	Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.
0.0	0.399230447003	And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.
0.0	0.445208805221	They elected moderate leaders.
0.0	0.31365923438	They are trying to attack us here in America.

0.0	0.298730262509	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.108721029529	But what...
0.0	0.235217011064	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.262472148611	Don't know that.
0.0	0.2699011621	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.165713582316	I got that.
0.0	0.187402409068	It feels different.
0.0	0.248342525374	But wait, I just want to say this Senator.
0.0	0.454730712503	ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.
0.0	0.25401078466	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.369717684623	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.299228460549	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.350958541281	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.29034503616	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.30264016023	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.362791721446	That's the big leagues.
0.0	0.477584357661	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.345874510375	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.197130172656	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.480441561385	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.328704362731	Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.
0.0	0.228142686925	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.214466740673	We have nothing.
0.0	0.330841690224	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.318160405496	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.288115477558	So they put together this.
0.0	0.548287988902	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.352528646203	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.330526515061	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.248019809011	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.181542387186	And he'll say, "Please, please, please."
0.0	0.294689042291	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.154616060225	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
0.0	0.491695501857	I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal.
1.0	0.66048202561	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.378262676585	We have people that have no incentive to work.
0.0	0.34360816766	I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.
0.0	0.4207896142	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.497260669654	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.2866350322	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.436353515909	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.
0.0	0.290007372339	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.352256664408	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.412789383818	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.313305913257	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.323676630765	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.
0.0	0.460905930645	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.273713737375	Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.
1.0	0.905181854893	Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.
0.0	0.286090756836	All of that together, we're going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.
0.0	0.311506413252	That was a terrible mistake.
0.0	0.358010524675	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.353143740558	Secretary Clinton is right.
0.0	0.439568925729	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
0.0	0.108721029529	No, you did.
0.0	0.413046151426	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.466503557872	She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.305374507867	And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them.
0.0	0.487731163872	We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.
0.0	0.223008117979	Did she do a great job?
0.0	0.391176647568	It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
0.0	0.391044504986	Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris.
0.0	0.437225530255	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.414223099571	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.428776213145	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.227955757799	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.275679911682	Fine, I'll take it.
0.0	0.4108109327	We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.
0.0	0.123282071021	But here's what's going to happen:
0.0	0.411009454583	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.419115019559	Doctors are quitting.
0.0	0.373594961818	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.303294595588	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.278930111302	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.425184604973	Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?
0.0	0.28806660198	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.50712922414	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.40467190576	Of course the United States must lead.
0.0	0.396063312324	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.412098912415	We have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as General Dempsey said.
0.0	0.39899132128	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.356638785605	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.270597978785	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.460298483671	I met recently with some members of the Chaldean Christian communities and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months.
0.0	0.453722577213	I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of State, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now.
0.0	0.455877837026	He's in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.241720549055	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.411749678756	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.178860869215	We're laughed at all over the world.
1.0	0.83466672135	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.413161549502	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.495541898518	Bottom line.
0.0	0.203730392822	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.400812930586	Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.
0.0	0.262681115019	Let me just say this...
0.0	0.335510737966	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.298418654034	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.343096076718	Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title.
0.0	0.436779769312	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.
0.0	0.304083716181	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.307231564596	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.240758807562	I would invite him, I actually would say.
0.0	0.444667512387	And I opposed it.
1.0	0.515217427714	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.229453459277	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.162072525774	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.391996706062	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.181054653173	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.511529768831	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...
0.0	0.352437873686	We actually took action to do these things and as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families.
0.0	0.628152441089	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
1.0	0.478226513171	And the overall message is that it doesn't result in job loss.
1.0	0.454102165136	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
1.0	0.697556570651	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.355069709908	So Ford will come back.
0.0	0.388008318065	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.108721029529	She did.
0.0	0.414023892406	We ought to send used equipment, right?
0.0	0.47208770409	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.0942409610085	But you know what?
0.0	0.30572368935	And we need the right people.
1.0	0.557240041636	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.495879016683	What about hydroelectric power?
0.0	0.43913580554	And that's only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.
0.0	0.292416880005	... Well, no, no.
0.0	0.30994806284	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.444135578543	Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.396349002567	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.438919943358	And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
0.0	0.3690780811	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.25180744096	And I think this is an important question.
0.0	0.476324199723	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.143878671662	And we can do it.
0.0	0.484617610779	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.299936256536	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.282810597308	He said, "You know, I make great product."
0.0	0.380188699778	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.353545038278	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.410972946284	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.429694514028	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.348078809352	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.243376684159	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.395356334833	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.47979377781	And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring.
0.0	0.202733090662	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.445305105322	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.292811915125	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.299648914753	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
0.0	0.214420004294	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.436373617857	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.364945732805	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.232553085956	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.300953198428	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.458892094406	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.362109687676	Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough.
0.0	0.382290625201	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.271245358693	That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them.
0.0	0.431036725588	I think we need major reform in the military, making it more cost effective, but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.33256384663	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.266027799616	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.278482787507	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.47111231531	I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.
0.0	0.538129357983	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.
0.0	0.239346380114	But what -- I will tell you this.
0.0	0.169485946033	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.336364203195	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.39864198554	Yes, this one falls under the category of, I have actually done this.
0.0	0.405416652796	More importantly, I want kids in Burlington, Vermont, or Baltimore, Maryland, who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade, who don't have a lot of money, whose parents -- like my parents -- may never have gone to college.
0.0	0.282688417296	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.44818358904	And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.431459851278	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.327838428398	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
0.0	0.184927842719	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
0.0	0.20393547579	I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
0.0	0.313665124715	But it cannot be an American fight.
0.0	0.418319465445	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.335597440709	It's not crass.
0.0	0.296052492566	Yes, I apologize.
0.0	0.300989981577	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.20109470616	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.465365133081	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.335815016258	It is enormously complicated.
0.0	0.415614831918	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.316952027688	I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path.
0.0	0.335502415464	I want immigration reform to pass.
1.0	0.368090092419	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.379388080082	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.28670917037	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.296289520384	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.461997298662	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.484177816076	I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains.
0.0	0.347063804723	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.241758252808	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.384299272209	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.432380187297	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.380004071833	Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS.
0.0	0.364545304288	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.314788206734	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.348387778448	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.388625174745	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.326534317005	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.382245810481	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.502557749068	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.283720797386	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.366727752343	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.427672407735	I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not.
0.0	0.387323102015	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.375772194324	As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that.
0.0	0.27490366964	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.30813622459	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.179530018202	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.343656386356	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.189972081951	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.338564345315	But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.
0.0	0.429549259165	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.380388481288	That is the clear and present danger.
0.0	0.365682510666	But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that.
0.0	0.333837504546	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.55536245488	And he also had no trouble appointing an investment banker to be in charge of his consumer protection bureau when he was governor.
0.0	0.292742471898	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
1.0	0.546365728689	I did introduce legislation to reign in compensation.
0.0	0.417057583206	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.272327924854	And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country.
0.0	0.408688575771	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.
0.0	0.162488848872	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.531693357985	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
0.0	0.354965190796	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
0.0	0.335506454067	Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
0.0	0.321792455781	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.344496801	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.436809717927	We have the U.N. Security Council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path.
0.0	0.215352425498	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.229568360962	That is exactly...
0.0	0.312347646103	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.577495481456	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
1.0	0.346651926868	They stole it.
0.0	0.219061704865	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.337500559252	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.304664967005	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.378248832993	They can provide resources.
0.0	0.356960201029	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.414490510156	We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.
0.0	0.292915054516	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.373481099993	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.277563759108	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.458145467508	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.4742056515	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.438274523368	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.334936985472	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.273354654673	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.403349893664	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.504637568372	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.322848515553	All of you in Iowa, I need you to caucus for me.
0.0	0.242440584956	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.42962431273	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.286698653373	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.31138440072	You bet they do.
0.0	0.365498854903	It ain't complicated.
0.0	0.368302365057	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.328224077141	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
0.0	0.224168588215	That's not the America that I think we should be.
1.0	0.458993130887	The Republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times.
0.0	0.330872501925	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.355957761334	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.262081157482	All right, Nancy, I really wish you'd come back to me on this on this one, John...
0.0	0.442646606818	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.26091531726	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.287415941357	They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it."
0.0	0.34794705919	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.354671278849	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.382887109119	So, in terms of refugees, I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe, with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that, of course, we reach out.
0.0	0.384476740836	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.444500459161	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.302505176001	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.321588463897	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.346844590393	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.416515687017	It means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana.
0.0	0.461765780288	Now that Russia has joined us in the Security Council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago, now I think we can have those conversations.
0.0	0.390371246272	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.514875394862	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.33207885119	He said, "I can't get it into China.
0.0	0.37700170031	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.297793382436	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.475730152976	We can triple the border patrol.
0.0	0.367585796897	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.431700404336	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.227833532665	We all understand that.
0.0	0.30149078561	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.506490513175	People died, and only three people have been fired.
0.0	0.411196126624	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.297353956249	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.311681904346	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.62899239848	We got $18 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.358877552884	We must keep America safe from this threat.
0.0	0.374374627925	By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job.
0.0	0.395785005491	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.329384835319	It cannot solely be America's fight.
0.0	0.302923604011	... but wait a minute...
0.0	0.253898400809	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.361140468415	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.247640808683	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.365324816677	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
0.0	0.108721029529	...
0.0	0.402752686333	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
0.0	0.355032878375	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.338369548963	And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.
0.0	0.420388004533	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.290512218733	We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.
0.0	0.512731366659	Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor.
0.0	0.398081466977	Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country -- we would never build in an ocean.
0.0	0.108721029529	How?
0.0	0.24121078282	I think we're missing the point here.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.29440105883	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.293012509519	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.288586689141	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.423979713252	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.453368503904	And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.
0.0	0.517893146707	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.499334589564	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
1.0	0.792657641782	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.421863515559	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.395023531162	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.403904904529	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.288941498984	Look at my family.
0.0	0.270571670917	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.437227904447	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.363868236191	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.238014713159	They were wrong.
0.0	0.604852581368	We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.
0.0	0.218872733932	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.317630440971	Our president doesn't have a clue.
0.0	0.48818014648	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.448663014242	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.327793517843	... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message.
0.0	0.243413439888	We must anticipate these threats before they happen.
0.0	0.377704923356	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.513574583342	My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.
0.0	0.371316268622	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.156472983794	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.52552504707	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.494510619636	So I believe that over the next few years, not tomorrow, but over the next few years, we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.108721029529	But Megyn...
1.0	0.79274660049	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.469025864646	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.660285151142	$5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.300052650966	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.369129352029	People were shocked, Trump got it.
0.0	0.415410966491	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.470678379895	Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.
0.0	0.358898711041	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.495604374738	You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.
0.0	0.430759931317	Got to be on the floor of the Senate.
0.0	0.214086396654	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
1.0	0.614369272565	I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.
0.0	0.4060451091	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.445188671703	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.202492210707	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.32784703151	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.362887781991	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.376539067742	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.42018313176	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.38627235199	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.214364480406	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.473154677577	It's campaign -- a corrupt campaign finance system.
0.0	0.106175361871	Yeah.
0.0	0.489292060112	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.364083956851	And in 19 -- and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said -- and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever.
0.0	0.374666941454	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.427526683431	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.515990871253	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.341506269658	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.320381662545	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.277622306066	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.311620301724	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.377423840354	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.108721029529	But...
0.0	0.41355027632	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
0.0	0.24688584807	Bret, we're just starting.
0.0	0.296082960131	They're terrified by the saber rattling.
1.0	0.471446074287	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.320332613388	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.407934120119	I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up.
0.0	0.395821339416	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.352398287189	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.417409759798	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.443291340434	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.364220163474	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.51349151533	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.309290926291	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.414805622213	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.477066968633	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.45667178449	That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.

0.0	0.322298024148	I'm not using donors.
1.0	0.552921176875	Today, we have about 4,000.
0.0	0.108721029529	It is.
0.0	0.319223795775	The Secretary's obviously right.
0.0	0.279412484614	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.402439871137	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.500694974197	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.241974024225	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.372489997896	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.418793510074	I made it the old-fashioned way.
0.0	0.213069678994	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.278445754606	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.
0.0	0.137034862642	I think what is...
0.0	0.404473334976	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.414023462323	We can in fact create jobs and provide job security.
0.0	0.242760594503	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.36988737066	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.31364770097	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.394781763248	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.108721029529	...
0.0	0.144716895216	And guess what?
0.0	0.263970012233	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.397297646005	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.319167602669	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.339225588965	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.306400231649	Again, Americans murdered.
0.0	0.364436529201	He thinks low wages are a good idea.
0.0	0.234700496897	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.43961583807	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.
0.0	0.474285336313	... funding to them.
0.0	0.137567247152	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.396129677707	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.386969100746	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
1.0	0.611115535626	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.410197422854	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.401134561225	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.345813179483	And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.423308344641	We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up.
0.0	0.390455359068	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.352123914404	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.259222219811	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.108721029529	No.
0.0	0.156250259019	They will not.
0.0	0.566537514053	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.386541191373	He said, "we have the military in the streets right now.
0.0	0.378585360826	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.377489418911	You can go to opensecrets.org and check that.
0.0	0.430168705975	Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.
0.0	0.446009770944	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.342240228561	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.355230084259	So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.
0.0	0.366234816313	But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble.
0.0	0.433128631519	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.45150074441	We have more people in jail today than any other country on earth.
0.0	0.293623504808	Now, I understand that this is very difficult.
0.0	0.612613508988	Trillions of dollars have gone from the middle class and working families to the top one-tenth of one percent who have doubled the percentage of wealth they now own.
0.0	0.30149078561	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.422095853604	... an agreement with the...
1.0	0.703818508838	This small country has welcomed in many refugees.
0.0	0.467957712374	And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals -- the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
0.0	0.240427207636	Let me say this.
0.0	0.54549809408	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.41322599951	The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.
0.0	0.422241816626	... (inaudible) opening statement.
0.0	0.437939438201	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.448336345873	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.623428198019	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.316178183235	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.336252612913	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.322594100283	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.301241355301	No problem.
0.0	0.294330925086	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.498180874994	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
1.0	0.506151231723	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.304962508191	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.203394526931	Talk about what?
0.0	0.330924136008	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.433251425774	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.325144690379	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
0.0	0.330857389859	We can build the fence.
0.0	0.0942409610085	So you know what?
0.0	0.37783384667	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.415015973586	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.36964110859	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.225687752801	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.33701308832	And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
0.0	0.387801373101	My point is this.
0.0	0.477752707637	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.486325163681	We expand Medicare to all people.
0.0	0.429828550962	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.368690835925	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.370588136919	Let's reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.294105455856	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.560831926673	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.402701330826	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
1.0	0.834569286914	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
1.0	0.625503327421	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.213892185289	The mentally ill?
0.0	0.352425732324	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.363630180681	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.424680232459	I believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation.
0.0	0.354078499448	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.
0.0	0.282380812367	We now finally are where we need to be.
0.0	0.478118003719	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.246233418217	So I would say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.237707172631	We got nothing but problems.
0.0	0.404691441706	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.385650752767	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.33508640177	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.360726798629	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.27113731905	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.53973475099	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.446925110726	I am proud that I was the first member of Congress to take Americans over the Canadian border to buy breast cancer drugs for one-tenth the price they were paying in the United States.
0.0	0.337196406283	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.472666798295	And also -- also, what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health care outcomes are not necessarily that good.
0.0	0.546832367982	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
0.0	0.541528656659	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.409782975562	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.
0.0	0.435239795041	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.421962940199	The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
0.0	0.413069741188	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.550404581955	Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico.
0.0	0.398817011977	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.324518900999	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.
0.0	0.376237467937	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.35170722852	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.457704900117	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.446389103029	And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity.
0.0	0.511983482477	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.359755709595	If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs.
0.0	0.488349409722	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.387643501147	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.288566005408	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.398323526609	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.382220707758	We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.
0.0	0.343444014929	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.537847295365	In addition to that...
0.0	0.537726118319	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.425906016451	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
1.0	0.429861083769	We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.154381130654	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.383951575001	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.305174789808	I would like to see it updated.
0.0	0.28619148892	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.143878671662	You can have him.
0.0	0.488568645721	You should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition.
0.0	0.411229832495	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.561791161657	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.514924199147	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.349091847793	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.25289015032	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.379862892914	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.181054653173	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.481829032518	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.257609514435	And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?
0.0	0.306746336104	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.469946976093	If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.
0.0	0.377157726817	Good evening.
0.0	0.40592303764	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.436669380079	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.41245489693	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.380168979697	You cannot grant amnesty.
0.0	0.319113366058	Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare?
0.0	0.261709405327	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.144113882326	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.239408250571	Well, let me tell you this.
1.0	0.826503056887	So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education.
0.0	0.339539825497	And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.
0.0	0.137034862642	Kathie, I think -- Kathie the...
0.0	0.281777336331	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.36103711561	That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities.
0.0	0.592409111325	Fifty-one percent of high school African-American graduates are unemployed or underemployed.
0.0	0.108721029529	That is...
0.0	0.439683099625	None of that information was looked at.
0.0	0.194019742921	Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.
1.0	0.707978704855	I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians.
0.0	0.30728058614	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.360786486388	And we also need a cheerleader.
0.0	0.473168132424	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.0467553028524	...Thank you.
0.0	0.459750225875	My son is not a pair of boots on the ground.
0.0	0.425853057289	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.225419482707	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.
0.0	0.172677233103	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.0942409610085	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.165051752246	... not everybody else.
0.0	0.387570185942	Terrorism in this country scares everyone.
0.0	0.138410631703	You're simply not.
0.0	0.548436828282	Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage.
0.0	0.286650250438	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.287663405292	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.37773147861	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.328289487027	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.333175728222	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.338519229128	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.213506572248	Please go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.364175604214	One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy.
0.0	0.431560915451	They can't even answer simple questions.
0.0	0.318686659605	Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."
1.0	0.55759371193	Two hundred children have been killed.

0.0	0.311866045969	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.271451609976	And that is what we have done in Ohio.
0.0	0.108721029529	No.
0.0	0.337696677275	So, I thank you very much for that.
0.0	0.275805158268	What have you got now?
0.0	0.46517209045	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.

0.0	0.394150693998	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.

0.0	0.298290079521	I would change them.

0.0	0.541676600715	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.531752204152	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.36051050258	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.521275217946	What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security, through the State Department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening.

0.0	0.253113324338	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.341060087449	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
0.0	0.227539037717	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.248430666278	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.520806465165	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.353237507347	Then (inaudible)...

0.0	0.145201406878	They're great.
0.0	0.489373756959	Many are in this building.
0.0	0.429784738736	Our country is in crisis.
0.0	0.362544424859	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.303668477615	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.328570432069	And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem.
0.0	0.473713104968	For example, it is outrageous that we don't have an opportunity for Medicare to negotiate for lower prices.
0.0	0.337885179098	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.22745730338	It is not tough talk.
0.0	0.313604297913	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.185595033537	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.555412510028	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.319881056518	We're rebuilding many countries.
0.0	0.394980896715	So that it will not be a federal crime.
0.0	0.425056575345	And I'll tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign.
0.0	0.455397575116	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.30580601398	And they don't know -- "Are you running?
0.0	0.179002218249	He sure did.
0.0	0.344265508467	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.258758231966	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.370535131766	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.361748784065	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.487212971242	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.121761302873	Look--
0.0	0.43164176059	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.404641418372	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.44165183781	It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.
0.0	0.446497099947	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.167669502087	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.416983323428	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.277959118077	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
0.0	0.454974449973	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
0.0	0.317879304443	And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.
0.0	0.313569790132	Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging.
0.0	0.344277199163	Sit down with people like John Mccain.
0.0	0.322730499654	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.364579706778	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.185542438197	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.133440261022	Right.
0.0	0.388677712671	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...
0.0	0.194652491209	I've done it.
0.0	0.371459619282	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.354418623828	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.153718177058	I'm the only person...
0.0	0.478506671582	So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
0.0	0.352337525819	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
1.0	0.506480237037	Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.
0.0	0.351893237063	And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.
0.0	0.330409161619	All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.
0.0	0.28842147216	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.375114500298	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.292784515556	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.414515867661	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.522673625885	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.311873321613	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.
0.0	0.410774877947	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.499215318314	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.518270920903	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.464430293943	She was naturalized.
1.0	0.75826664737	They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.
0.0	0.608787147459	You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.431169738832	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.319998843341	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.632189143212	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.262133249632	I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination.
0.0	0.191716200861	So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do.
0.0	0.43000154825	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.133440261022	All right.
0.0	0.31129874616	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.515615798608	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.360219405253	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.473558792152	Bill.
0.0	0.389253672739	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.439670406424	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.346026526402	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.343579911404	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.352387847265	That is the issue.
0.0	0.241666046858	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.512600280973	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.539774390899	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.490134631942	So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.
0.0	0.352285014967	And I have to tell you, I would not want -- if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my health care.
0.0	0.143350004019	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.375489435931	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.360899429127	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.436141106378	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.445015264134	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.405425083518	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.398886590197	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.40379968754	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.3358674796	But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.
0.0	0.34223130759	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.43705878197	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.347530448087	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.31068596643	All of these are very difficult issues.
0.0	0.326775113348	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.404761044701	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
0.0	0.517860300928	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.393646704323	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.241288116787	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.275760358302	We don't have victories anymore.
0.0	0.197512712074	Excuse me, no.
0.0	0.323140946971	Let's get rid of Assad later.
0.0	0.161570355515	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.254806597102	The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.
0.0	0.305860075123	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.419655088727	Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.
0.0	0.294569473645	We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear.
0.0	0.379951535651	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.390372475222	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.521464105867	... first of all...
0.0	0.282847267009	It is time to believe in America again.
1.0	0.843554219716	And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money.
0.0	0.564052938368	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.331246973179	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.422835286255	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.422046509474	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.369297053153	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.466705781026	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.387382869275	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.555249657827	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.414336643584	But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.353690423182	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.

1.0	0.327534240831	A lot of people up there can't get jobs.
0.0	0.326103183621	So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there.
0.0	0.618952778493	Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.
0.0	0.3293379882	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.20505790605	I think it's a two-pronged issue.

0.0	0.403565792704	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.379520823624	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.421621405699	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.29534315116	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.3787658918	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.

0.0	0.3831925748	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
1.0	0.819126142696	The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation.
0.0	0.303681881546	I've faced it.
0.0	0.385219876872	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.

0.0	0.465611781859	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.342851126947	May I respond?
0.0	0.337008921513	We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.
0.0	0.598989560117	Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent.
0.0	0.54843022034	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.

0.0	0.291698089988	I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.512308282077	We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that's what's keeping him contained.
0.0	0.460983839276	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.404401082176	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.

0.0	0.337696677275	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.437343010406	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.

0.0	0.133440261022	That's right.
0.0	0.215352425498	Absolutely.
0.0	0.321630338942	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.392336025515	That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive.
0.0	0.30386904539	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.397234502046	We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be -- we ought to send our surplus.
0.0	0.538699228135	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
0.0	0.570458227905	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.290180270883	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.
0.0	0.133440261022	All right.
1.0	0.598051048983	And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent.
0.0	0.187245853462	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.448873607189	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.17236178269	It never happens.
0.0	0.367466788447	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.343565782999	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.332000237658	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.420525469919	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.289662491444	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.
0.0	0.359980387335	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.420790111078	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.392180776041	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.386661677376	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.24317032008	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.266344718323	We don't want to be Sweden.
0.0	0.379320876394	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.293666855365	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.30938768821	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.412063496346	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.536212139339	And, unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage, I actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.371007538199	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.422924113916	That is some group of people.
0.0	0.337210880167	From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made.
1.0	0.410247898428	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.405468834916	Medicare for all, single-payer system is the way we should go.
0.0	0.525095595014	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.428406257553	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.369444272799	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.37429360371	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.312621747626	I don't think a halt is necessary.
0.0	0.448413097072	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.36373724067	And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country.
0.0	0.423620048613	And most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that.
0.0	0.299355849676	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.332620308431	We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
0.0	0.354493243193	Predominantly African-American and Hispanic.

0.0	0.295555473111	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.447104084332	But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired.

0.0	0.468130024813	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.

0.0	0.264264214016	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.455057787513	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.158356215826	And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.
0.0	0.547814985317	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.313600335571	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.286800844644	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.418392144664	We used to have victories, but we don't have them.

0.0	0.335899820431	It sounds crass.
0.0	0.431039599788	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.

0.0	0.346506254244	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.566736726239	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.389068145166	If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune.
0.0	0.395481176865	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.487115732403	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.468535234476	Paul Volcker, one of the leading lights of trying to reign in the excesses, has also said he does not support reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.41442596762	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
1.0	0.786830733698	And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.
0.0	0.395978818795	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.372975849525	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.299959339299	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.261869137294	We have -- I don't know that there's any disagreement here...
0.0	0.173696475506	We need a doer, not a talker.
1.0	0.855311931309	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.386207541107	But those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort.

0.0	0.1576119106	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.313947806457	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.313397639293	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.31128563681	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.431335784736	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.43120473484	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.498373060886	Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
0.0	0.252140068765	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.339723545434	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.401267943278	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
1.0	0.660533179754	She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.
0.0	0.259542717425	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.382872729337	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.411962224722	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.

0.0	0.51725423423	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.507163659387	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.355585527663	He can't have it both ways.
0.0	0.480207910387	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.446657776061	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.420778369365	I think it's fair to say that Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America, but the issue is...
0.0	0.263718690335	Creativity.
0.0	0.461447804236	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.259224108771	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.346718219809	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.368321831043	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
1.0	0.385072382008	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.224162372652	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.369903878287	... we will secure the border...
1.0	0.857868591433	Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education.
0.0	0.392239293015	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.396315479029	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.48932990958	Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, "Rand, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.373890749773	We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended.
0.0	0.306901630482	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.475716497477	Starting with our children and moving forward.
0.0	0.382427822145	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.631890450584	I released 34 years of tax returns...
0.0	0.303826697916	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.311551235641	I do not believe in unilateral American action.
0.0	0.411119826389	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.387138257268	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.279019148055	Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.
1.0	0.559206479482	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.360664557586	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
0.0	0.450509871009	But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
0.0	0.311633437992	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.304701598323	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.161609924097	That's really nice.
0.0	0.31949750744	... and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.565587718106	We were the first to pass a minimum wage.
0.0	0.251527127924	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.443153256358	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.522294158187	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.461612510712	I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.
0.0	0.363204509564	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.379091896289	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
1.0	0.494241081404	Unfortunately, Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, set about decimating it.
0.0	0.51267869072	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.39093003908	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.330872501925	No, they shouldn't.
0.0	0.473072406393	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.533738092714	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.429048939125	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.312608196705	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.236929976317	They're killing us.
0.0	0.454472862169	You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization.
0.0	0.269415617324	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
1.0	0.322657805105	They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us.
0.0	0.390791594339	I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done.
0.0	0.267093111975	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.168225885639	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.0942409610085	And you know what?
0.0	0.394668712908	We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.
0.0	0.521259776705	They are our first line of defense.
0.0	0.349037327492	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.210179840793	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.291949220143	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.384235774119	And we've got to do more on equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.0467553028524	Thank you.
0.0	0.391046507492	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.444060522638	I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.
0.0	0.597530125361	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.330810551577	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.336789844964	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.374529332941	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.345827719552	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.246910982246	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.455530138181	Well, I'm kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time.
0.0	0.414240030606	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
1.0	0.388252429464	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.39417508606	Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees.
0.0	0.362641711883	And America's best days are in front of us if we move forward together.
0.0	0.381050109597	We got a U.N. Security council vote.
0.0	0.402758771119	This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.
0.0	0.293732355276	He'll say, "Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico."
0.0	0.42859285149	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.229729441533	Not good.
0.0	0.278195179266	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.349842242186	They have children who are doing so well, I've met and worked with dreamers.
0.0	0.325509206407	That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.
