0.0	0.250043036166	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.
0.0	0.160069978204	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
0.0	0.258794516965	It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.

0.0	0.337156240973	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.311384981525	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.107470431705	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.273524169607	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.190944528462	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.
0.0	0.0546838435725	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.521095266135	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.0305485971871	You know why?
0.0	0.3822807565	Not keeping the government open.

0.0	0.109167000819	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.0964636700282	And we do have to form a coalition.

0.0	0.0379457804944	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.142592357948	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.267986647708	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.383295647096	No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.
0.0	0.483805162178	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.621684688032	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.621867191758	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.181864732483	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.037868264785	Okay.
0.0	0.480459047122	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.107986142916	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.271531912813	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.368483568814	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.164562328196	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.311571852484	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.

0.0	0.175901505622	Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid.
0.0	0.181952092887	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.383318153907	You know, on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign, I was in Keene, and I was asked what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?
0.0	0.0308955078265	...Chris...
0.0	0.171225863237	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.488123146412	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
1.0	0.525473287818	But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.
0.0	0.0657569252939	We can build the fence.
0.0	0.10907916271	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.458445483601	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.0563632223006	He's very upset.
0.0	0.0588165827754	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.168063454498	I -- I believe that we should make community college free.
0.0	0.399957885423	No, both the federal and a state approach.
0.0	0.544637286726	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.26253128688	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.
0.0	0.200035627896	And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.
0.0	0.0230121088788	I love China.
0.0	0.145317373763	Yes, I'm getting...
0.0	0.0657201694779	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.0249092610804	That's what our parents and grandparents always did.
0.0	0.181361713184	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.266753470798	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.5	But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
0.0	0.373904835821	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.331104890917	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.293982252178	I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
0.0	0.0791540691298	I have a problem with that, Martha.
0.0	0.156847355182	But they're killing us economically.
0.0	0.5461393852	Some of the bravest people that I had the privilege of working with as secretary of state were our development professionals who went sometimes alone, sometimes with our military, into very dangerous places in Iraq, in Afghanistan, elsewhere.
0.0	0.039127347241	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.644829093258	I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.
0.0	0.108798623304	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.202812969351	No.
0.0	0.488886551559	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.594692821566	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.
1.0	0.966166590326	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.374638880756	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
0.0	0.158972466451	And I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern.

0.0	0.212943715476	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.428943693942	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.456047556417	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.166901469728	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.212046479244	I was there in '89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.
0.0	0.330392945731	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.485342647155	It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act.
0.0	0.47796154211	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.

1.0	0.396038099284	Twenty-one mass shootings, including one last weekend in Des Moins where three were murdered.
0.0	0.0855010838419	But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand.

0.0	0.474417937392	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.0696323050724	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.0723886579984	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.

0.0	0.301679823509	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.30049397097	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.

0.0	0.012702575237	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.352768586791	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.289069481338	Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.
0.0	0.0671475899599	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.188578592336	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.108518694064	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.

0.0	0.0200283638491	You get together.
0.0	0.493423016673	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.855649575732	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.139106992178	It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.
0.0	0.204370156024	Quite likely, for that reason.
0.0	0.365407917151	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.101227581965	There is a vacuum.
0.0	0.0642498943263	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.33799873914	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.0456246286896	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.153322393937	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.227842338602	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.126709489024	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.052401072897	We have to do something.
0.0	0.138475258486	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.

0.0	0.261496267979	How the hell can you vote for this guy?
0.0	0.634920362939	And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.
0.0	0.222832597228	I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.

0.0	0.166537483197	They don't know if it worked.

0.0	0.0749375665267	They have to be alert to problems.
0.0	0.219384962549	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.432709780792	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.0128300704216	The mentally ill?

0.0	0.292276877057	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.543095036403	But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector.
0.0	0.141318941045	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
0.0	0.352302775294	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.339530910892	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.188960149765	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.50885893575	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.861619052988	And I opposed it.
0.0	0.837858695453	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.0632847406465	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.154518548925	And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.
0.0	0.0728559940451	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.404560361981	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.522001973776	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.517217915331	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.0649887177406	They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists.
1.0	0.338447771188	Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees -- these are big vehicles -- were left behind for the enemy.
0.0	0.2941645133	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.428990015438	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.251252181606	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.0718147995584	We need much more than that.

0.0	0.459642635614	... first of all...
0.0	0.253109221158	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.0594038111639	I have no idea.
0.0	0.508692431374	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
0.0	0.0819060989293	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.484263463086	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.175368936853	Today I heard it.
0.0	0.241845296694	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.77276047413	That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.
0.0	0.473197606633	You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks.
0.0	0.150700370982	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.314503210377	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.62279990484	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
1.0	0.262693302958	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.474825619946	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.145144049655	I don't think the term is what's important.
0.0	0.448462231597	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.145802117534	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.200717580943	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.297792221073	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.016861635848	We did our own rallies.
0.0	0.347445996386	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.28015544539	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.368163437005	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.20359650736	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
1.0	0.780378606598	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.200163038326	And God bless America.
0.0	0.0848064098354	Don't know that.
0.0	0.0770455867579	And for good cause.
0.0	0.121706097053	Last point.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.202812969351	I have.
0.0	0.518535541336	It was the most highly sought after -- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
0.0	0.153179373945	I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.
0.0	0.22661985089	I mean, that's a fact.
0.0	0.198418667304	You've got to go the extra mile.
0.0	0.303099469326	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.0688740813382	And, we said no.
0.0	0.0671439757322	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.172820803773	And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth.
0.0	0.128959478634	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.280087860481	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.381256600208	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.651411064821	We reduced violent crime to 30-year lows.
0.0	0.238267738073	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.128305417079	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.156568435624	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
1.0	0.511981504351	But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works.
0.0	0.0675751458379	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.261890653828	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.621326937982	You do legislation.
0.0	0.215803815349	Dynamically.
0.0	0.291932866747	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.0938256980049	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.179049392627	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.0732290335842	OK.
0.0	0.0395274868586	Right.
0.0	0.202812969351	...
0.0	0.304457151585	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.187390921487	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.124391903248	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.743079886363	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
1.0	0.646379366002	Well, we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists.
0.0	0.276998979748	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.
0.0	0.155958953878	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.489157377762	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.166778296502	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
0.0	0.0970769053373	But I would say this to you, Bret.
0.0	0.646914436166	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.24087492801	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.221521552179	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.175034349498	But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate.
0.0	0.297617896346	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.116429593725	I've gotten to do some incredible things.
0.0	0.227366059801	Common Core should -- it is a disaster.
0.0	0.873782638731	Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble.
0.0	0.0844779572658	She never lived to see that.
0.0	0.202812969351	No their not.
0.0	0.275857692122	Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone.
0.0	0.48180371816	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.
0.0	0.2220907079	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.133219527821	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.249772921781	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.
0.0	0.0104459871355	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.550854884999	And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.
0.0	0.133092601989	I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.
0.0	0.305387782248	Chris I was mentioned in that question.
0.0	0.0587245763487	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.492093937598	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.00603126525195	So be very, very careful.
0.0	0.281855983516	They all want me to support them.

0.0	0.342562597276	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.

0.0	0.22097396037	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.176463810283	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
0.0	0.26404926553	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.346641953839	We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party.
1.0	0.936781896445	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.335204479579	It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.
0.0	0.0995595934626	He said, "I can't get it into China.

0.0	0.335974026569	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.463210386119	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
1.0	0.595389129386	I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer.
0.0	0.0464096693605	Don't do it."

0.0	0.630455126508	I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.
0.0	0.08147903493	Divide that out.
0.0	0.356350417295	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
0.0	0.162957002439	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.0363874932861	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.587150625205	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.384805799017	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.332056068452	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.

0.0	0.201500253507	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.127923100869	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.13330264546	There are a lot of things we've got to do in our country, reigning in Wall Street is certainly one of them.
0.0	0.202812969351	How about this?
0.0	0.829799891325	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.462925189225	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.393137033182	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.234870517622	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.0969956746264	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
1.0	0.912891744955	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.0996043162799	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.176341212184	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.070027956992	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.293497388876	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.307143793132	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.539108569429	The nature of warfare has changed.
1.0	0.965983266202	We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.
0.0	0.257284785055	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
0.0	0.582303094838	And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.
0.0	0.254209090386	Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground.
0.0	0.0464096693605	We haven't.
0.0	0.129971376552	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.466965537083	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.473365660403	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.45785090825	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.226235163807	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.

0.0	0.868321352401	Bill.

0.0	0.139009006629	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.247287861156	And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.
0.0	0.37203751236	I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.
0.0	0.247542770602	So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe.
0.0	0.112651991394	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.
0.0	0.204175688344	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.293500113849	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.193738879308	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.709162231127	First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty.
0.0	0.144435087526	So I would say, "Congratulations.

0.0	0.22867662495	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.281891153478	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
1.0	0.999994119296	In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.
0.0	0.29947016545	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.276125976093	You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.
0.0	0.18333946504	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.203345434194	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.37448697137	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
1.0	0.999999143763	Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education.

0.0	0.0172655699747	We are rebuilding China.
0.0	0.689583298308	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.241001174741	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.975387762925	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.371939562039	And second of all...
0.0	0.456905839027	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.131888966064	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.181977770345	So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.
1.0	0.510873152118	Unfortunately, Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, set about decimating it.
0.0	0.258084767973	Now, what does that mean?
0.0	0.150589376895	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.144669714676	No, John.
0.0	0.46352387965	And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement.

0.0	0.484620315342	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.103307421078	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.115323418142	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.0374024968704	I think he is right.
0.0	0.359741046658	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.537085984052	And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.
0.0	0.03505135047	We need to define the enemy.
1.0	0.166050718211	Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.
0.0	0.129148357741	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.
0.0	0.221150864983	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.119537000743	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.140580742157	But they can't get along.
1.0	0.994223487137	And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.
0.0	0.330460837553	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.202812969351	That has not been...
0.0	0.50688954185	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.123853590587	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.0756254706019	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.281700330461	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.070617458654	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.675708796247	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.0950083345415	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.104194364189	And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce's great story.
0.0	0.444250903793	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.303744332685	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.396852503634	These are often very long- term kinds of investments that have to be made.
0.0	0.328351695403	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.163580303232	We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game.
0.0	0.236654466808	That's not true.
0.0	0.288622196341	But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.207234734242	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.557699290917	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.0543309966041	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.097224068258	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.0869782569444	I will find -- within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy.
0.0	0.292272751384	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.482949796804	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.448281333735	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.316892998161	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.231295823504	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.414660285182	We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.
0.0	0.107553947072	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.206325556578	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.211979383598	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.308833872984	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.160827344898	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.786046750385	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.372607875231	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
1.0	0.165215661474	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.222271699609	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.672423576582	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.231986404543	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.0852668106106	I have to tell you.
0.0	0.134145512028	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.0432095368678	Wait a minute.
0.0	0.96042612207	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.387742195663	The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.

0.0	0.0772416237082	I won't be doing that.
0.0	0.138898123257	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.

0.0	0.202812969351	What do we do?
0.0	0.172973554931	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.

0.0	0.468901569467	We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be -- we ought to send our surplus.
0.0	0.452540840614	I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.
0.0	0.0305485971871	You know why?
0.0	0.313027413942	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.

0.0	0.512145179388	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.198729904828	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.349885443811	A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.

0.0	0.208770249134	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.576533162517	So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.
0.0	0.127954162884	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.0732290335842	OK?

0.0	0.23004146043	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.275393687854	No, I've never made a promise like that.
0.0	0.0629382932618	There's give and take.
0.0	0.245293116417	Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.
0.0	0.531548093413	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.394568248942	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
1.0	0.999996136482	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.

0.0	0.0385215524443	Absolutely.
0.0	0.605550457514	And, unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage, I actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.224440795466	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.

0.0	0.172192946642	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.127159621018	I would just say that...
0.0	0.106544834013	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.377354393323	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.107868988545	I've always listened to you, Megyn.
0.0	0.370080999069	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.399054389211	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.687963904632	So as a nation we need to increase what we invest in Pell grants.
0.0	0.287054685761	We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States.
0.0	0.0995846741291	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.161315136882	I've had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say, I don't agree with you on everything, but I like what you do.

0.0	0.459642635614	First of all...
0.0	0.186217869278	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.
0.0	0.13149539505	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.379153947622	Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
0.0	0.0664171981496	I have formed them.
0.0	0.261116107263	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.124180437585	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.144588569336	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.0952069318619	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.115692965213	And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.
0.0	0.348203473681	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.113014779459	All right, Nancy, I really wish you'd come back to me on this on this one, John...
0.0	0.336320162926	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.425864983193	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.25045055613	It has too much economic power.
0.0	0.202812969351	It is.
0.0	0.05673979827	They don't have a clue.
0.0	0.21979190423	And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.199829369776	I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
0.0	0.492845798858	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.279526178587	You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.
0.0	0.567725507339	I think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12 it would be the highest historical average we've ever had.
0.0	0.53147925592	And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.
0.0	0.01789899153	Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.
0.0	0.308817694843	And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.11865334348	And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it.
0.0	0.170981348573	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.147772377343	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.34940114189	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
0.0	0.346939226101	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.351332763614	Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.

0.0	0.239696640539	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.
0.0	0.0521191986218	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.244805111259	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.405035105164	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.483022133393	We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents.
0.0	0.333249756829	And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence.
0.0	0.35932584857	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.608372049145	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
0.0	0.506827473467	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.47677017097	John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.
0.0	0.190584688643	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.270866986109	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.

0.0	0.118892168021	Check it out.
0.0	0.263432375827	In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.108016335386	Go ahead.
0.0	0.240886745939	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.451929859552	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
1.0	0.976031477688	Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.
0.0	0.148487668953	And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
0.0	0.311756816778	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.45111632681	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.95460788987	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.0540570396827	I would not want to go to that point.
0.0	0.245055894992	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.079590341037	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.272153536966	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.0413537856195	Excuse me.
0.0	0.17657422273	And America's best days are in front of us if we move forward together.
0.0	0.587922772559	We have a corrupt campaign finance system dominated by Super PACs.
0.0	0.0656995517812	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.288989257972	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.
0.0	0.13776774277	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.
0.0	0.344977398285	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.175218958054	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
1.0	0.997114482512	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.0665238688536	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.

0.0	0.221436810331	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.299635166383	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.

0.0	0.114098592873	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.

0.0	0.228824773394	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.0257362740199	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.531270671376	I do respect Rand.

0.0	0.123794411955	We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.
0.0	0.474170443943	But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.
0.0	0.601939066983	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.179043122198	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
0.0	0.225353330722	Afghanistan is a mess.

0.0	0.111311173063	I've faced it.
0.0	0.17992854892	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.617898163215	We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.
0.0	0.398988895917	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.34847347595	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
1.0	0.429966388847	You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small.
0.0	0.16482702931	She said the truth.
0.0	0.246877088711	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.

1.0	0.996444748876	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.204776050536	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.537033389574	The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.
0.0	0.54262128486	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.22915358904	That's when we become Greece.
0.0	0.637491033303	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.038313390626	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.410736448345	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
0.0	0.863908439302	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.186410253363	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.151658384787	I'm all about making sure we actually get results for whatever we do.
0.0	0.457054425474	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.154815390917	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.437134965517	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.280118960527	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.285289351654	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.176489582323	I never said that.
0.0	0.509423199966	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.222933547477	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.3991589214	You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
0.0	0.284860683556	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.222565419357	And here's the problem in this country right now.
0.0	0.0415893403577	It sounds crass.
0.0	0.141640308164	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.256322579058	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
1.0	0.328959856173	When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.0967561185038	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.203787712435	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.0218343752538	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.0647975904533	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.0619550830772	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
0.0	0.226309123971	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.202752942477	Yes.
0.0	0.110789335998	And he is a proud American Muslim.
0.0	0.18979139106	If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.
0.0	0.290225152327	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
1.0	0.99607462443	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
0.0	0.539160804469	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.47540573501	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.175151146917	Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging.
0.0	0.336326468881	We have a lot of work to do, to better prepare our nation and to better lead this world into this new century.
0.0	0.18005456619	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.179822576142	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.29524432787	I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.
0.0	0.0599538712997	So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.
0.0	0.138524710179	Now, here's what is going to happen.
0.0	0.630520911551	So protect the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.205776577489	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.519052158056	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.242952000611	I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.
0.0	0.945214540518	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
0.0	0.348423915588	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.130853283268	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.395362076689	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.224778654404	Good company.... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in -- and I wouldn't even use -- you know, I have -- I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
0.0	0.275211978953	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.0435804276146	We can't.
0.0	0.202812969351	No, no.
0.0	0.0351462573542	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.268979573114	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
0.0	0.429697542593	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.136509019093	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.20556644889	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.103953088274	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.171331391756	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.1953914543	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.253462284971	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.3436558714	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.180884281502	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.381440388024	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.0547573227921	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.317684217823	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
0.0	0.00555190211782	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.206500251757	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.120300623453	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.273788573264	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.306564915164	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.420528457039	More importantly, I want kids in Burlington, Vermont, or Baltimore, Maryland, who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade, who don't have a lot of money, whose parents -- like my parents -- may never have gone to college.
0.0	0.627737699627	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.0489924136114	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.617734787288	States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government.
0.0	0.159278092601	We never dreamt we'd ever see it."
0.0	0.254848556104	I've had had two town halls, one in Keene, one in Laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do.
0.0	0.843648448046	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.230698838388	And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.316302795338	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.181754140085	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.45785090825	And loose money is one of the major problems.
1.0	0.13579914704	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.299674659694	We also have to build a coalition at home.
0.0	0.295939172413	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.
0.0	0.114526063598	I think it's important we put this in historic context.
0.0	0.428847037502	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.5	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
1.0	0.74208326282	That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.
0.0	0.235438817666	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.11369261337	I can promise you.
0.0	0.383512201494	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
0.0	0.0823593741351	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.0967777411399	I said, "I don't know."
0.0	0.344463452664	Make ourselves stronger at home, but also our role in the world, yes, is also to confront evil when it rises.
0.0	0.367808080893	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
0.0	0.257064406155	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.835011874094	I introduced...
0.0	0.17786936538	And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said.
0.0	0.0442879962786	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.387700901618	So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years -- you know, we're at $8 trillion now.
0.0	0.573432959352	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.30199542462	Let's do more -- let's do more than reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.168739672568	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.395656762995	Now that Russia has joined us in the Security Council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago, now I think we can have those conversations.
0.0	0.145650313813	That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.
0.0	0.200176653866	But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."
0.0	0.179517357553	I want immigration reform to pass.
0.0	0.306624415546	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.113946443704	Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy.
0.0	0.669311135357	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.560485759434	And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.297065324316	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.

0.0	0.0725738610332	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.172457325949	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.264881438314	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.43986181636	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
1.0	0.940826323304	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
0.0	0.547006083854	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.57855513587	And he also had no trouble appointing an investment banker to be in charge of his consumer protection bureau when he was governor.
0.0	0.331298972791	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
1.0	0.157686807237	It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.342214658435	He's the greatest show on earth.
0.0	0.303885274711	I'm totally open to a tariff.

0.0	0.268975161357	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.351678366425	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.392457713019	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.353839510607	We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.
0.0	0.659397378722	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.

0.0	0.691005301515	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.688222085004	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.707902948528	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.158148930673	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.30993141008	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.22335108167	And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.

0.0	0.451463154358	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
0.0	0.0676937803855	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.417893366128	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.

0.0	0.5	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.259951182025	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.348875168077	I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones.
0.0	0.234161185558	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.563935582734	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.

0.0	0.099382499191	We need more principle.
0.0	0.145463689577	Yes, we must protect our borders.
0.0	0.0892523028351	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.144254467223	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.193745961185	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.0970243131211	I didn't know I had so much power.
0.0	0.147655749942	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.176292911407	Otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.
1.0	0.970885515904	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.269759314884	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.

0.0	0.572845781864	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.25625614012	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.0760003834338	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.2497604586	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.345158347137	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.
0.0	0.0757372329241	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.604625662785	Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage.
0.0	0.377782439725	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.

0.0	0.0704731779551	I don't care.
0.0	0.113368568304	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.399696412362	The worker's out of a job.

0.0	0.332374076771	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.160009440646	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
1.0	0.656752271334	Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion.
0.0	0.0308955078265	Chris...
0.0	0.310477436477	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.370724527607	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.284994710192	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.667689424049	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.465302877022	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.170760024518	You can -- you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.
0.0	0.232519144339	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.277861184035	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.0933028419638	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.24999249205	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.
1.0	0.999999998971	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.201796178267	I think after 11 hours, that's pretty clear, yes.
0.0	0.0999216163433	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.20716761513	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.5	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.352901352173	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.429963707055	That's what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I'm proud that they're supporting my campaign.
0.0	0.429792950977	The American people are terrified.
0.0	0.443468475753	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.383754013155	I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.
0.0	0.236048421931	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.25238420343	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.167354370717	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.159378433714	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.329062852199	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.0922745486383	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.894758855031	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.491174490565	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.562708130496	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.105562753472	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.218770430853	The Obama administration.
0.0	0.293124306906	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.840769811477	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...
0.0	0.445769716579	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.180407648256	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.0514485855219	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.462882377952	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.0814055733617	As governor, we continued to work together.
0.0	0.202752942477	Yes.
0.0	0.216431842985	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.650181957309	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.279508230678	Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.523807452816	Just for the record.
0.0	0.0480910159811	And he'll say, "Please, please, please."
1.0	0.937167731655	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
0.0	0.118234272289	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.0467306468737	What about hydroelectric power?
0.0	0.154254285748	I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.236758602141	We have people that don't have it.
1.0	0.982605174613	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.116628942119	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.0385215524443	Absolutely.
0.0	0.956019761105	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.243180807704	First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.110174329596	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.0356632368434	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.0333360255058	Here's what I believe.
0.0	0.318859661405	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.
1.0	0.332635085862	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.38635935799	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.716297011886	There was a minimum wage at the state level, and some places went higher.
0.0	0.144669714676	John?
0.0	0.282162411301	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.190378686289	As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
0.0	0.284136980279	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.
0.0	0.154082987125	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.992558202432	So the total is $8,737,540,00.
0.0	0.125103869279	My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.
0.0	0.227115929211	I want to thank the people of Iowa for being so welcoming to me.
1.0	0.975011226905	One candidate said, you know what, I don't think it's a great idea that we sell automatic weapons in this country that are used by the military to kill people very rapidly.
0.0	0.131893363147	We can't even go there.
0.0	0.132201615535	I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third.
0.0	0.110025102657	How are we gonna -- how are we gonna go back and make it great again?
0.0	0.126947343316	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.240765801721	They blow people up.
0.0	0.0169385288069	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.166092093115	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.20151558727	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
1.0	0.345140397266	They're bringing drugs.
0.0	0.0974206920401	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.202812969351	What should we do?
0.0	0.409544615724	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.089385713174	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.0395274868586	Right.
0.0	0.192332304472	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.219640499883	I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis.
0.0	0.218591324513	But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble.
0.0	0.436888558917	The endorsements that I'm proud of are conservative leaders like Dr. James Dobson, and over 700,000 contributions nationwide, people going to our Web site, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.0756813275578	You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches.
0.0	0.18269550714	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.130376018554	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
1.0	0.341421494883	And some of them are like third world countries.
0.0	0.178863995089	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.41632163552	And let me, by the way, take this moment to congratulate Hillary Clinton, who I thought not only did an outstanding job as our first lady, but redefined what that role could be.

0.0	0.284213671037	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.932250062446	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.

0.0	0.232228453497	We've got to build a coalition abroad.
0.0	0.738070066585	Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.
0.0	0.0259011329949	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.230485363802	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.0940631059786	What we know is we're living longer.

0.0	0.14481116879	You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America.
0.0	0.574612078914	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.

0.0	0.170421111407	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.461198599403	We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress, but it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us.

0.0	0.100769288822	I don't want immigration reform to fail.

0.0	0.0166630619335	I will not do that.
0.0	0.24146816246	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.298678403914	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.282363487995	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.0982530827347	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.105125751697	That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
0.0	0.115000453252	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.0480231033094	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.837145396416	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.181945774793	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.201608746727	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.
0.0	0.0189421095439	We serve you.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.259709664655	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.277099139334	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.041811131246	Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.
0.0	0.137300565227	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.125042540395	You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.
0.0	0.0819445902611	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.268374871086	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.349225993121	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.264779663	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.223524183544	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.417210532417	RADDATZ: OK. Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, right here at Saint Anselm college, Neil Levesque.
0.0	0.3890828408	Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top.
0.0	0.590628970252	Kathie, that is the kind of economy I believe, put money in the hands of working people, raise the minimum wage to 15 buck an hour.
0.0	0.609602713197	According to the economists -- who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying -- that $24 trillion -- we're very close -- that's the point of no return.
0.0	0.0103599617639	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.0857794600717	I'd suggest people take a look at it.
0.0	0.58113128609	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.28526702412	Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem.
0.0	0.0145162024085	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.202812969351	...
0.0	0.767618226762	I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.
0.0	0.524678342557	First of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy, as you've indicated.
0.0	0.161719369025	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.449972776492	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.428228552347	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
1.0	0.978248342024	And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.
0.0	0.104666499377	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.591691636303	But the United States is not the policeman of the world.
0.0	0.225678033296	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.129376705186	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.477636908215	And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues.
0.0	0.230680502154	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.605265006256	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.0875729971809	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.177228096478	It certainly does cover it.
0.0	0.345662735051	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
1.0	0.459036959469	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.155005386331	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.822766232749	Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions?
0.0	0.136421543348	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.480514682191	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.168737660503	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.
0.0	0.151143152398	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.028660604609	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.189315602108	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.351075982685	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.233214835729	If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.
0.0	0.523686026719	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.736058849517	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.442809265238	Yes, and it was the same one that President Obama made.
0.0	0.248906390736	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.0922726528557	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.331439723017	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.907478923435	Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day.
0.0	0.274826623975	How can you get people to vote for you?"
0.0	0.0952717681152	They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it.
0.0	0.269395989525	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
1.0	0.176936077549	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
1.0	0.999997026396	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
1.0	0.997153177014	Very few children.
0.0	0.332416041345	Parents, and sons, and daughters and family members, and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them, we must remember this, that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century.
0.0	0.228580820221	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.400540731657	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.173570377959	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.318759586808	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.288741652186	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.395622971618	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.213008400475	What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy, and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need.
0.0	0.449414821323	So I said (ph), "No, that's the wrong number.
0.0	0.236654466808	It's true.
0.0	0.0614149209324	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.287034531621	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.235358691452	When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.
0.0	0.769198079389	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.252743174008	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.901751151764	I released 34 years of tax returns...
0.0	0.225140169919	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.0704731779551	I don't care.
0.0	0.230155570441	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.223339804881	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.243969298487	We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
0.0	0.0493499105695	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.109175826967	It was a different situation in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.350364740205	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.337017066509	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.12883357788	There has never been a jihadist group like this.
0.0	0.386777875348	The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign.
0.0	0.178056649372	Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
0.0	0.202812969351	...
1.0	0.968205058338	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.348730876806	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.164737751108	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.202812969351	Do it.
0.0	0.026080491474	That's what really matters.
0.0	0.121712481969	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.283388018468	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.407352602757	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.738400293505	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.0333360255058	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.287835685911	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.052507589464	I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country.
0.0	0.0691708738758	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.510173792981	I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.
0.0	0.235390720408	We can have debt-free college in the United States.
0.0	0.0152880989302	I think you're --
0.0	0.0131828890796	It's not crass.
0.0	0.204436288695	The CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary.
0.0	0.0331102921547	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.487175230957	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.0502173361694	They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.
0.0	0.378918027644	Who are we kidding?
0.0	0.202812969351	It was.
0.0	0.243363785646	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.0608279300721	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.105175270766	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.311934542838	And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.202752942477	Yes.
0.0	0.115544978309	That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.
0.0	0.167285222889	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.400200401999	It's a divided country on guns.
0.0	0.314269053476	The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders.
0.0	0.17181396305	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.312512850097	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.410654957742	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.687200810128	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.123137674785	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.366095369931	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.167206575856	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.650322689575	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.0865919695626	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.509531878525	Kathie, this was not merely theory in Maryland.
0.0	0.202812969351	What are we doing?
0.0	0.36645478676	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.517462946341	And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.
0.0	0.31765056525	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.727243749099	It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military.
0.0	0.386053455575	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0223434456694	They think they are.
0.0	0.672423576582	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.248175380642	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
1.0	0.996538598006	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.0605536072787	We have the opposite thinking.
0.0	0.300342715938	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.0999216163433	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.152061080436	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.302466529778	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.
0.0	0.259301440357	And now many of these candidates want to cut it.
0.0	0.0675014367317	You know, this is not easy work.
0.0	0.632181328623	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.144669714676	...John...
0.0	0.123965555949	I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work.
0.0	0.330087524566	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.30003101355	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.409766827673	I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground.
0.0	0.350398846061	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
1.0	0.972858585397	There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign.
0.0	0.784501282747	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.782027128534	You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.525871528134	Why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want?
0.0	0.206012488083	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.319209385684	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.27244948028	I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.
0.0	0.110652960021	Jeb, please attack Ted..."
0.0	0.188151033395	That's because we've put conservative policies in place.
0.0	0.409133365164	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.211540177281	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.52470542897	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.573840585326	I'm not using the lobbyists.
0.0	0.190001107186	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.197043555027	I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.
0.0	0.199619058061	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.220110199825	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.168920400027	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.361320623984	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
0.0	0.170312463071	I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria.
0.0	0.228151889339	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.261706972699	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.602925556811	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.194502945182	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.0781457123351	I said, "I don't need it.
0.0	0.602765401262	I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan.
0.0	0.244285555037	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.0720392027615	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
0.0	0.072501180748	Martha, if I may...
1.0	0.421034709347	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.202752942477	Yes.
0.0	0.981807838389	We increased education funding by 37 percent.
0.0	0.236654466808	That's not true.
0.0	0.528250088433	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.0448080186341	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.121153128773	People say, "Oh, you don't like China?"
0.0	0.284118175672	Marco opposed this because they made a deal.
0.0	0.311050021361	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.596784039088	You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.
0.0	0.355188724266	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.0942773530745	And I think this is an important question.
0.0	0.193303654235	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.123954009245	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.826566386972	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.319930366407	David, there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees.
0.0	0.130868933292	And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.
0.0	0.200389525904	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.584587286679	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
0.0	0.255044672238	But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.
0.0	0.866938080233	We raised the minimum wage.
0.0	0.180509217437	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.130921831503	We don't need more of the same solutions.
0.0	0.145173341856	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.
0.0	0.547459961504	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.206060593019	I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.
0.0	0.484933429035	And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.
0.0	0.250081831355	We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended.
0.0	0.635706607799	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.321406948813	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.451707997983	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.202812969351	No.
0.0	0.178604808753	I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.
0.0	0.0707902665273	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.245793831614	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.132252147524	... ground and air.
0.0	0.16965764846	We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.
0.0	0.180625828195	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.281449512095	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.250355284653	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.320089677978	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.241568263167	We need new leadership.
0.0	0.563955034939	They've advertised that.
0.0	0.0873047150627	But what -- I will tell you this.
0.0	0.105814670608	Say again?
0.0	0.653977681761	But accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000.
0.0	0.118604916224	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.400847469806	Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.
0.0	0.274302633966	I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support.
0.0	0.190556079331	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.167371999121	Wall Street today has too much political power.
0.0	0.47053144891	You have all of these disastrous airports.
0.0	0.444597512018	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.
0.0	0.0191729437991	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.543977366679	That's the wrong number.
0.0	0.0251169141141	Can you believe this?
0.0	0.202118653954	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.0769523029113	We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.
0.0	0.245418951221	I mean, let's talk about this arc of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about.
0.0	0.0979623742193	I think that what we're facing with ISIS is especially complicated.
0.0	0.22270923625	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.481329487488	Could we have your support?
0.0	0.252670945854	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.182997436839	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.458786653156	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.101527661285	Everybody thought it was a done deal.
0.0	0.386909731674	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.274192768993	So that it will not be a federal crime.
0.0	0.0910637009819	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.119174644485	They are not going to go away on their own.
0.0	0.0945836026107	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.424566056861	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	0.5	And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.
0.0	0.173013561063	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.113455244143	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.162092826174	None of that information was looked at.
0.0	0.725583241838	And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.
0.0	0.580207280508	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.105601651726	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
1.0	0.999999962144	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.106200684219	It won't happen.
0.0	0.158665741207	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.096145887806	We have to come together as a country.
0.0	0.168421213861	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.262343013191	I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.396869934502	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.131312912467	You want to know what carpet bombing is?
0.0	0.15303594654	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.563000020702	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.
0.0	0.202812969351	No.
0.0	0.258824397382	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.0991029517576	I know the overrated ones.
0.0	0.220625546978	One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this, is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations.
0.0	0.312020179814	The people that Washington leaves behind.
1.0	0.551505114087	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.221769244446	The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.
0.0	0.113220077816	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.27667368609	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.652536552894	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.337866889674	May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care?
0.0	0.172816159363	Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.
0.0	0.159033020233	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.438114091359	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.556220326466	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.229509541347	So -- because we got to make the country rich.
0.0	0.253283490792	That's gonna be the real growth engine.

0.0	0.208006630831	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.101712823207	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.138633649234	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.110431835545	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.518595877068	She's an American citizen.
0.0	0.242371437903	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.12975814591	But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go.
0.0	0.0713932048944	He can't have it both ways.
0.0	0.596495317016	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.448968905697	I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
0.0	0.0421308821	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.217382817912	So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
0.0	0.202752942477	Yes.
0.0	0.172968347783	It is broke, it is not working.
1.0	0.985582716934	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.182253416264	Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.
0.0	0.0564506806249	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.202812969351	...
0.0	0.321962509153	She wants to pursue the American dream.
0.0	0.192386755116	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.241510729646	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.

0.0	0.328248497883	I know that because I buy the product."
0.0	0.236941240468	I lead the opposition against it.

0.0	0.0395274868586	That's right.
0.0	0.224052017408	And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition.
0.0	0.0395274868586	All right.

0.0	0.0848064098354	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.638638391649	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.109972369806	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.147521670743	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.168955294143	They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.
0.0	0.789036394382	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.0856449491634	I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination.
0.0	0.429639588223	I would change them.

0.0	0.168044304794	The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.
0.0	0.278346285007	In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...
0.0	0.189735061975	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.148826005328	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.0856176411729	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.

0.0	0.169474477079	And so do I.
0.0	0.319464373933	But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks."

0.0	0.0671318206652	Came out great.

0.0	0.0616390520452	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
1.0	0.52276719688	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.281364406143	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
1.0	0.978472850999	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.203989548625	And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.806444137501	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
0.0	0.115538394331	They're terrified by the saber rattling.
0.0	0.327712590056	But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
0.0	0.0198482246873	...No, sir...
0.0	0.368492094526	When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.220168574356	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.131693699075	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.125401997778	The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering, these are not the perpetrators.
0.0	0.101171801883	What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.
0.0	0.274972263976	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.171459239007	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
0.0	0.276142582544	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.154599823509	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.234392123688	This is not the type of campaign that we run.
0.0	0.0922859067115	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.592731444103	... we have the tools in federal law to do this now.
0.0	0.0933028419638	Let me just say this...
0.0	0.258729290396	Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.281097873458	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.349364233754	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.255619912157	And we ought to fight them on that level.
0.0	0.206693047944	And that this world, with American leadership, can and must come together to destroy them.
0.0	0.482505045903	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.0912965625185	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.578639396877	In fact, if you remember, 50, 60 years ago, the University of California, City University of New York were virtually tuition-free.
0.0	0.322471954289	Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.389527270916	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.194343474577	Many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed.
0.0	0.687524884416	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.0612463693493	But here's what's going to happen:
0.0	0.537163590844	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.0830508401674	Let me say this.
0.0	0.107564813378	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.396298108342	It had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.109715324875	They're killing us.
0.0	0.2888662625	That never works.
0.0	0.321431011075	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.13575782633	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.158117775205	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.
0.0	0.413498872997	What is the best way to do it?
0.0	0.404288133715	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.41048615224	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.
0.0	0.893889625172	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.408510499982	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.169438608434	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.0597300301133	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.0487412865249	But we came together.
0.0	0.452371828248	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.376712830462	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.378661139503	It's a country in which people choose to buy guns.
0.0	0.289784952459	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.292124359101	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.180074629742	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.219188375128	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.211541695141	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.187287727319	I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is.
0.0	0.0739869582962	And one more point, one more point.
1.0	0.663090257826	And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
0.0	0.0395274868586	Right.
0.0	0.0790879164994	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.146367450791	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.641097947275	That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
0.0	0.302536672297	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.
0.0	0.471255839178	It means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana.
1.0	0.810402932925	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.284194689115	They can provide resources.
0.0	0.680778175154	Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.
0.0	0.327762890611	They are not doing it now.
0.0	0.920603133773	It is not because of the tax writeoff.
0.0	0.184270261625	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.108418116524	That's the good news.
0.0	0.379397629005	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.546590628308	I was in Burlington, Iowa.
0.0	0.335915962693	But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that.
0.0	0.73644923425	I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.
1.0	0.766993111613	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.0613428332135	We don't need that.
0.0	0.108954341071	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.0417742231444	I think we're missing the point here.
0.0	0.0920919689915	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.52381873118	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.0688740813382	That's what I said.
1.0	0.657565656117	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.17653419116	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.144840283175	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.
0.0	0.418245155658	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.449109606568	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.294222262278	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.203062771377	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.25539087893	We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground.
0.0	0.216186277632	We were attacked from Afghanistan.
0.0	0.143896988127	We only have one or two.
0.0	0.25605369436	The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world.
0.0	0.221600290498	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.155978860189	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.202812969351	...
0.0	0.161351937662	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.089272184015	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.161120274562	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.438869709029	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.334173626437	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.280782598932	We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.
0.0	0.375859393243	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.116952629578	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.12697015651	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.202812969351	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.363276530724	When we put money into the hands of working people, they're going to go out and buy goods, they're going to buy services and they're going to create jobs in doing that.
0.0	0.434047323295	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.0977474764917	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.548804344721	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.538849296727	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.356350819764	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
1.0	0.99999816726	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.0795094497982	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.370385253315	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.
0.0	0.146783508394	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.299174926512	So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income.
0.0	0.362900976218	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.257787646157	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.871154605741	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.0522421659253	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.346331604332	I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks.
0.0	0.164385106487	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.0285528179149	You're welcome.
0.0	0.307494533293	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.0588848694184	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.440188776884	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.287453823195	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
1.0	0.886630356313	It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.
0.0	0.0612654742447	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.447343528289	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.364311624719	This is a complicated issue.
0.0	0.539485232909	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.208717615301	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.0924806636832	That's fine.
0.0	0.322605944358	The young officer who was killed responding to the Planned Parenthood murders.
0.0	0.478027157104	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.393401317579	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.384139069667	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.0238978237082	We can do that in Washington.
1.0	0.922942207793	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.390636436032	We shouldn't have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time.
0.0	0.158157019069	But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.
0.0	0.110293652247	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.0670822243268	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
1.0	0.999982670146	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.360644813851	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.465901991201	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.680214181867	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.187848768879	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.318196038376	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.245537076894	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.300334578148	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.204800269117	The people don't work for us.
0.0	0.309075475967	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.387769980245	Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.
0.0	0.387406812477	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.272574486489	It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably -- probably -- from the Middle East.
0.0	0.0385215524443	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.137471884491	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.113605047241	I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary...
1.0	0.978032433314	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
1.0	0.911826273988	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.569156673453	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.202812969351	...
1.0	0.415339555565	2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.
0.0	0.342209103734	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.13264510114	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.151864724889	All of that together, we're going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.
0.0	0.290124691327	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.227482483421	That is why we need to make police -- and I speak as a former mayor.
0.0	0.607066114156	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.266932025498	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.0464096693605	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.192685279614	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.153616823109	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.
0.0	0.292735257048	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.658909601128	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.312548520349	We need to do it now as a nation.
0.0	0.042764335049	It's great to be back.
0.0	0.26202961822	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.0679234204023	We have problems with Russia.
0.0	0.377171915173	Every (inaudible) Democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rosa DeLauro, got ears (ph) to legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave.
0.0	0.138367408437	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.215452266108	So Hillary and I have a difference.
0.0	0.26414758059	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.213861232446	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.582849249439	They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe.
0.0	0.341004439866	What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years.
0.0	0.85259953121	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.120043090895	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.11884951673	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.083914285975	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.0176746652634	Then I looked at Rubio.
0.0	0.277668631888	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.168093456846	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.
0.0	0.231646274264	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
1.0	0.833228119796	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
0.0	0.0939659209289	We get a traitor.
0.0	0.585571775653	Tear down the EPA's blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates.
0.0	0.217286161034	But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
0.0	0.747510418148	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.298973097705	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.153046971363	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.306271521446	Our country is in crisis.
0.0	0.353410160532	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.556220326466	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.212988142173	And I will go back and say again, AIG was not a big bank.
0.0	0.230243183784	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.114900756651	That's the big leagues.
0.0	0.312581697193	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.916821219831	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.839228792992	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.360211809491	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.264368127036	But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.
0.0	0.288371694573	When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it.
0.0	0.214101192585	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.0460303582945	Can I -- can I -- I just...
0.0	0.34519296413	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.
0.0	0.651187500153	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.0975101485426	Wow.
0.0	0.46793752885	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.238883795525	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.109014364517	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.372903940364	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.285605848554	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.19459692447	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.0909369787326	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.253891104391	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.419161012543	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.0448616767001	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.211888594668	... and I encourage everybody watching this tonight to please, acknowledge that by going online at martinomalley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism.
0.0	0.199055221176	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.1313374461	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.264705656731	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.
0.0	0.50593322937	They would never be hired again.
0.0	0.313805403976	ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.
0.0	0.345779130991	And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.
1.0	0.999999774546	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.0792598472784	OK, good.
1.0	0.5	According to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.97461027392	They make a billion dollars a day.
0.0	0.123534423505	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.205689738624	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.912285231155	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.405214924512	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.34848341166	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.135923335889	I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.311257221426	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
0.0	0.294102684006	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.370167136683	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.388063470267	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.272128879756	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.0679837428627	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.0277068601855	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.246385879955	As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election.
0.0	0.153192818074	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.00791438484351	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.171416260207	And that is what we have done in Ohio.
0.0	0.197868527903	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.86128599594	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.0395274868586	That is not right.
0.0	0.40568646922	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.109605091139	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.993348429763	...income tax...
0.0	0.146311238344	On welfare.
0.0	0.354907493623	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.
0.0	0.465611994744	But unlike either of these two fine people, I've actually balanced a budget every single year.
0.0	0.355741750203	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.107983098983	You have a bigger problem with China.
0.0	0.142973926574	Martha, thank you.
0.0	0.852951134076	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.574440649606	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.286154437657	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.294593313676	The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
0.0	0.524720330368	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.673285304722	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.157409220775	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.609328434995	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.292057181849	And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.265336071111	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.187572211054	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.21421947941	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.0612372728125	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
1.0	0.320845878729	We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
0.0	0.462573481202	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.06018639835	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.183382873456	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.447442435363	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
0.0	0.770479781349	They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
0.0	0.00815476577777	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.156799786649	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
1.0	0.0737818000644	The 500,000 who came home with PTSD, and traumatic brain injury.
0.0	0.444250903793	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.353424163337	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.775653777722	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.651909893856	They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
0.0	0.311984202547	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.238160600115	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.679026673852	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.584680754941	Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.
0.0	0.444686233312	Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, who said my plan for what we should do to reign in Wall Street was more comprehensive and better.
0.0	0.124209686137	We've got the consensus, what we're lacking is political leadership...
0.0	0.216157159678	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.66606540367	Yes, well, roughly.
0.0	0.202812969351	And why?
0.0	0.5	Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
0.0	0.115847939771	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.79507779474	Number one, there are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.422600184681	We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we're not going to hand out citizenship cards, either.
0.0	0.0977753469751	And it's just not going to work.
0.0	0.541727159653	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.599880987949	But, bottom line is this is the year 2015.
0.0	0.368361053558	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.213503484807	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.161767800565	If you want to make it into the middle class -- I'm not saying in all cases -- we need plumbers, and we need carpenters, and electricians, that's for sure, and they should get help as well.
0.0	0.235099944877	They can't even answer simple questions.
0.0	0.0622680066767	We will do very, very well, very, very well.
0.0	0.311199078917	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.690945813171	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.310233717162	Again, with all do respect to Secretary Clinton...
0.0	0.387862152152	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.788377164927	And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.670609384727	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.0230121088788	I love China.
0.0	0.0664973881258	That's off the table...
0.0	0.0305485971871	And you know what?
0.0	0.179563008245	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.241658339504	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.923096678352	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.149328483033	David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave.
1.0	0.494053403599	In 1988, I lost an election because I said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of America.
0.0	0.255378274986	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.0235758205707	I agree completely.
0.0	0.446925367303	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.549258347264	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.103645084002	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.0944893431867	So nice, thank you very much.
0.0	0.269253157127	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.084733177707	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.094059296239	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.107470431705	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.330819933137	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
0.0	0.201654215207	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.214889028027	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.648098741631	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.12549518107	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.213841374103	Very valuable.
0.0	0.0852668106106	I tell you that.
0.0	0.0385502834392	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.306968065913	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.0395274868586	That's not right.
0.0	0.0600339055822	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.366163557437	Yes, this one falls under the category of, I have actually done this.
0.0	0.509680640878	There's never going do be perfect bill.
0.0	0.172061100587	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.269663597648	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.195288098627	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.448048374689	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.00705167047735	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.318137580291	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.367020158371	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.0605810340288	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.276334758883	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.191877558298	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.0222183227505	Sorry.
0.0	0.283160995037	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
1.0	0.63342498334	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
1.0	0.378571044855	We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks a piece.
0.0	0.39301701233	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
1.0	0.999994735608	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.147436417339	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.570636844271	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.16549401943	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.415237427565	The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court?
0.0	0.258955585095	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.77738262666	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.136197617305	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.572486876989	When you ran in 2000, you said that we needed federal robust regulations.
0.0	0.181112920047	... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region.
1.0	0.636412510076	I did introduce legislation to reign in compensation.
0.0	0.234730051933	Now, our country needs -- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
0.0	0.220121886163	That's the job.
0.0	0.301373454712	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.294811436543	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.202812969351	Megyn?
0.0	0.142090204414	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.297222481748	Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.357059851409	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.198442044521	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.203012020595	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.08404247489	And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.
0.0	0.657587827334	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.192086633008	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.161488554009	As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans.
0.0	0.156846826902	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.985846997876	She voted for it.
0.0	0.278448161047	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.368971389907	Again, Americans murdered.
0.0	0.345599598379	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.0695458027228	We have -- I don't know that there's any disagreement here...
0.0	0.602507801282	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.329021485234	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.0658585755473	We're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.962641470558	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.0875181580695	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
1.0	0.984454879822	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.243864015722	We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
0.0	0.249179345167	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.530128512318	It was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up.
0.0	0.18357087915	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.316209029446	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.140602022244	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
0.0	0.323405160408	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.345040999597	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.231535597316	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
0.0	0.232463986334	The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.191222092079	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.37019254641	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.0489643479065	... What was your question...
0.0	0.17252271361	They serve in the military.
0.0	0.363860874477	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.568249191985	So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.
0.0	0.922588783449	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.314247111161	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.199780986294	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
1.0	0.309765365401	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.141931480307	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?
0.0	0.467861913751	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.111490393167	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.0374024968704	I think so, right.
0.0	0.0871760435876	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.154760355316	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.308052794901	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
0.0	0.786186834989	My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.679836451294	Of course, you would.
0.0	0.109154961561	Making sure that Muslim Americans don't feel left out or marginalized at the very moment when we need their help.
0.0	0.202812969351	...
0.0	0.249709502024	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.128984401571	I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.
0.0	0.379381100391	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.368690236153	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.0997432891342	Well, thank you.
0.0	0.162582433764	You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.
0.0	0.05077637139	There's a lot packed into that statement.
0.0	0.154323718612	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.275527789271	So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.
0.0	0.222827555058	He's wrong.
0.0	0.5	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.149846318206	Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.280904298255	You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes.
0.0	0.0688740813382	I said no.
1.0	0.31363280542	They just built a hotel in Syria.
0.0	0.513203056501	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.462752864666	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
1.0	0.52189677134	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.0555963418722	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.382904666054	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.0837057971398	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.859208118554	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.611025357835	I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.
0.0	0.254964163803	We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.
0.0	0.0796698231097	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.14000251555	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.107140457773	And it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer.
0.0	0.0709457575011	And Martha...
0.0	0.337488057736	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.267963330137	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.271033326441	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.
0.0	0.250169737206	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.0333360255058	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.32803783876	So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.
0.0	0.368652000134	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.095175114902	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.524962829	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.293306797412	So, yes, this has developed.

0.0	0.192560680584	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.1873775904	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.

0.0	0.404641094207	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.

0.0	0.154237437854	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.

0.0	0.471250971534	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.219312185592	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.
0.0	0.120300623453	So, I thank you very much for that.
0.0	0.144789463037	And I do not believe it's a good idea now.
0.0	0.225421457867	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
0.0	0.122180591158	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.175858325851	Big difference.

0.0	0.234245656924	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.209887780041	We have a role to play in this world.

0.0	0.0394907581315	That's not fair.
0.0	0.101354115662	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.173897487915	Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take.

1.0	0.995655276798	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.103057437401	And that's what we have to contrast.

0.0	0.792105852642	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.439907628835	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.410310731139	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.476263302001	But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.

0.0	0.175770981931	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.0414718334566	I hate to hear it."

0.0	0.0331360779861	Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.
0.0	0.544120135905	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.557541827732	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.

0.0	0.130847351208	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.323312731861	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.0637410310311	I like how you stand up.
0.0	0.207010208524	And as our party's nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.406797462067	We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.
0.0	0.0195998300394	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.0540445945894	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
1.0	0.999999928454	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.
0.0	0.251047143904	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.380057735609	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.232179926028	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.12883386743	I love this country.
0.0	0.255072743532	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.329732730386	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.410347440509	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.187445282761	You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.
0.0	0.393574502756	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.8881832873	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.105481361369	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.07065009332	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.5	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
1.0	0.154317840724	They're bringing crime.

0.0	0.204108459212	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.43186809243	And so people are still going to get health care, thankfully, in emergency rooms, in hospitals.
0.0	0.104712250975	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.0381459473998	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.102172155332	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.384157618156	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.0278336517268	They'll all come back.
0.0	0.471190984432	So what I had to do then is go back and start working on a bill that wasn't the bill that I wanted.
0.0	0.210779681851	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.
0.0	0.112077521648	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.170098045608	Where are you gonna clean it up?
1.0	0.681621266491	And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent.
0.0	0.270713454974	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.662187154614	Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.199549909919	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.263452069885	I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history.
0.0	0.142480260955	We've been at this a couple of years.
0.0	0.0808870008279	May I respond to the critique on the ...
0.0	0.258519526077	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.0797687365298	So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
0.0	0.23831346681	How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
0.0	0.274205292614	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.114217192594	I'm meeting with three of them in the next week.
0.0	0.0602361192904	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.147416104186	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.242254795771	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.408255815139	... that's the -- that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration.
0.0	0.289976338703	I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not.
0.0	0.141713358822	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.320677292284	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.12612902768	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.125501904519	We say "we're gonna protect."
0.0	0.14807532419	... Chris, your questions that you...
0.0	0.135677267093	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.134776292353	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.0806917218309	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.400731939764	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.105576473395	I just want a job.
0.0	0.163849696965	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.430257686002	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.576323145026	I led the effort, unfortunately unsuccessfully, against deregulation because I knew when you merge large insurance companies and investment banks and commercial banks it was not going to be good.
0.0	0.290370729596	That's a drag on the economy.
0.0	0.408415145392	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.182938880306	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.133891486099	If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.22130499895	And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world.
0.0	0.0115565307112	Wait for what?
0.0	0.333725210263	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.186616259818	I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.
0.0	0.0488206059191	Good evening.
0.0	0.456059549547	Get rid of the fraud.
0.0	0.0545815476483	It's hate action.
0.0	0.171241210854	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.662578013416	I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains.
1.0	0.950209923503	Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.257282772469	We went after those who had attacked us.
0.0	0.151176409867	Lehman Brothers was not a big bank.
0.0	0.338176044892	First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, "they cannot have it all."
0.0	0.159172614234	Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.
0.0	0.225409879019	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.743249393923	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.357793885796	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.21019336051	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.394713258438	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.157908046256	And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.
0.0	0.320264172691	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.178097742104	I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization.
0.0	0.304256951048	And I think that's the false choice...
0.0	0.104006102157	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.0608516905754	We need -- we need somebody -- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.
0.0	0.0901181090859	And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
0.0	0.140963799024	I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.
1.0	0.734243010587	We passed it after 9/11.
0.0	0.11924735978	He was on the board.
0.0	0.10629866814	Good at email.
0.0	0.283270205404	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.738463916828	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.431771762701	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.327469877098	Given the fact that she's a lot smarter than me, yes, she would.
0.0	0.343190582903	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.380963802475	Doctors are quitting.
0.0	0.0721734083802	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.0187028091062	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.13878926687	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.5	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.125182066271	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.
0.0	0.652665802529	They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.
0.0	0.140263645632	And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.
0.0	0.377972796381	If we are not successful, if we continue the same old, same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big-money interests, nothing changes.
0.0	0.154995863421	Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us.
0.0	0.847047166973	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.208984709307	The big banks--
0.0	0.228885722254	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.236747978736	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.328256803948	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.202812969351	No.
0.0	0.0602600303683	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.262307134651	And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears.
0.0	0.447978070423	And in that capacity, I met with just an extraordinary group of people from World War II, from korea, vietnam, all of the wars.
0.0	0.0983781765973	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.182985150759	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.202812969351	You did.
0.0	0.22320802151	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.300009822502	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.383142007381	Now, you'd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me?
0.0	0.0928052408436	Let me respond...
0.0	0.192961929708	We have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as General Dempsey said.
0.0	0.202387769122	... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street.
0.0	0.202812969351	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.259449728148	Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.859516977728	I'm one of the 77 percent.
0.0	0.379964437487	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.577355182859	Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.
0.0	0.589687327334	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.0492341345302	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.053046634024	Yeah.
0.0	0.293728993496	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.0684474455311	That is absolutely not right.
1.0	0.999984030921	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.431948533495	We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.136699868979	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.371369257521	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.922325172176	We end up paying the highest prices in the world.
0.0	0.0333360255058	That's what we believe in.
0.0	0.222827555058	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.0661483342259	And we are not England.
0.0	0.153535932378	I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.
0.0	0.198930469098	Man (ph), their mother's here as well.
0.0	0.0839686171527	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.99999982966	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.684760456321	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
1.0	0.53459888089	The truth of the matter is, net immigration from Mexico last year was zero.
0.0	0.333572403522	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.191769891933	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.443423482463	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.289352909801	As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that.
0.0	0.424083415547	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.513309548173	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.814016337784	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.603181990393	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.333431317289	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.67204918061	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.0305485971871	And you know what?
0.0	0.908346119849	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.256018715446	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
1.0	0.0840009756044	They stole it.
1.0	0.354800866837	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.243824501436	They had a plan that was good.
0.0	0.457004171047	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.0977672766455	We're running.
0.0	0.300878458079	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
0.0	0.159049803982	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.596598740228	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.113341689238	So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.
1.0	0.991665206613	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.441946760076	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.159380269835	That's calling it what it is.
0.0	0.26139218186	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.264508030175	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.30153902472	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.282591820592	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.552628087333	Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product -- a sign of strength, right?
0.0	0.000923964826666	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.21855991787	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.0336113342283	And guess what?
0.0	0.202746405559	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.230168269643	Sit down with people like John Mccain.
0.0	0.313253313337	We need money.
0.0	0.159798421893	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.202812969351	...
0.0	0.202812969351	Both.
0.0	0.206981160946	And Abdullah said something recently, very important.
0.0	0.0777202395327	There are thing that can be done.
0.0	0.724147530763	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.21981663189	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.457673075315	And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity.
0.0	0.334213781893	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.610619901338	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.0889351074683	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.316322642613	Wall Street is a threat to the economy.
0.0	0.17695167057	They will not bring us -- believe me -- to the promised land.
0.0	0.29026814948	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.232176356946	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.150001349171	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.0805599571738	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.116301728747	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.14421592426	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.396583862965	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.21800987321	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.365900980992	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.200888266471	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.0955520279352	You want one?
0.0	0.62611727506	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.432952271319	If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune.
0.0	0.133787892478	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.811478406908	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.173846427558	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
0.0	0.219335901852	I think we all support that.
0.0	0.259271555956	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.165227233785	That's what the political revolution is about.
0.0	0.17517100657	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
0.0	0.172105941885	Well, thank you, John.
0.0	0.0886417925297	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.136497788985	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.238277877433	You learn to create a security cabinet.
0.0	0.100129194865	The facts are are very, very simple.
0.0	0.388424141201	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.0654434046789	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.0558792021994	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.168690899431	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.17279727174	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.761941270932	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.412565553132	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.275221251256	But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said.
0.0	0.36910014539	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.5	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.229183877997	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.169474477079	But I...
0.0	0.230047288424	I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.
0.0	0.617442385853	Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world.
0.0	0.0164069477791	It is a disaster.
0.0	0.259442225786	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.54365868829	My name was invoked.
0.0	0.0830508401674	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.123901462086	Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.
0.0	0.101093033268	Just can't happen.
0.0	0.179049005393	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.289364450754	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.174238520158	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.190735277957	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.122913883841	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.491273687815	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.171898073608	Because you realize that people depending on you.
0.0	0.15218671812	Great state, great people.
0.0	0.0166630619335	I will do that.
0.0	0.202812969351	Again...
0.0	0.0695498485515	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.316521792138	It's interesting that Jeb mentions the book.
0.0	0.303312761089	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.512163881133	I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
0.0	0.584627989721	I am advocating...
0.0	0.251592070024	A military island.
0.0	0.381779665508	I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
0.0	0.622804026378	Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care.
0.0	0.118653036098	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.0569797027126	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.320034506629	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.12878129528	Because I've seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime.
0.0	0.0385215524443	Absolutely.
0.0	0.187487071179	You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future.
0.0	0.202812969351	I do.
0.0	0.225359570077	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.265199613764	It's Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.
0.0	0.368597791459	There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan.
0.0	0.30326153006	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.114623221718	And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.
0.0	0.187642807025	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.247566896895	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.54704190043	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.66965335156	I am proud that I was the first member of Congress to take Americans over the Canadian border to buy breast cancer drugs for one-tenth the price they were paying in the United States.
0.0	0.344780998328	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.292646494383	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
1.0	0.994625101708	When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.
0.0	0.343721418918	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.147812371419	They have no choice.
0.0	0.302643604579	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.395908358688	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.372820920326	You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?
0.0	0.182854697557	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.0980116649518	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.840345778842	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.23171056695	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.148130767097	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.220332824353	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.117686121877	Everybody thought the deal was dead.
0.0	0.679836451294	Of course not.
0.0	0.163053943315	I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.
0.0	0.202812969351	...
0.0	0.143776691412	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.0601123000439	We did a lot to help.
0.0	0.162330738451	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.234456711579	White people?
0.0	0.347325426366	That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.
0.0	0.116051520278	And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.
0.0	0.259040798572	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.320836057583	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.350842383819	I've prosecuted terrorists.
0.0	0.0592968287616	And I watch the speeches.
0.0	0.13001801264	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.100285724503	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.207973608115	Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.
0.0	0.0385215524443	Absolutely.
0.0	0.171232847007	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.177143833572	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.11572580119	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.340962383515	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.0848064098354	He didn't know.
0.0	0.0223434456694	Think about it.
0.0	0.276057691964	And, here's what she said to the American people.
0.0	0.0919546701023	They're saying, "Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough."
0.0	0.304044459029	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.0692107607077	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.120300623453	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.547728171999	Never support.
0.0	0.17770650203	So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has.
0.0	0.202812969351	No, I have not.
1.0	0.887321828323	And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions.
0.0	0.352859610916	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.344891623139	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
1.0	0.218441820105	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.382772143453	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.601106777702	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.413750739846	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.494527202036	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.463946110477	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.20903714302	Yes -- thank you.
1.0	0.571603051995	Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.
0.0	0.294936921538	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.204090920025	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.343021364414	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.591384050961	What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.18604795095	Well, you've got to be on top of it right away.
0.0	0.351038139051	Our country is in serious trouble.
0.0	0.202812969351	No.
0.0	0.445566170137	So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act.
0.0	0.0897980229282	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.327900508969	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.18456688953	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.357980703822	Well, we're going to have to redo the way the prescription drug industry does business.
0.0	0.175331207344	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.169711839699	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.112373162834	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.333052598173	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.104714925236	Thank you Chris...
0.0	0.0963630275124	It's great to be at Trump Tower.
0.0	0.493232222202	I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader.
0.0	0.537554794732	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.296262375743	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.206789132683	You know, we had this incident before, Secretary, with your famous e-mails.
0.0	0.370477867606	And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending.
0.0	0.140464721237	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.352635277721	All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.
0.0	0.340405449712	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.901685992534	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.272643986512	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.168760671891	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
1.0	0.999998454236	Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.
0.0	0.329404635987	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.190689529425	So, your original question is the right question.
0.0	0.0893695569036	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.560827940494	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.549233614149	The student loan problem has been created by government.
1.0	0.94537156286	Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.
0.0	0.445609742025	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.345687893767	It's one of 15 strategic goals I've set out to make our country a better place by cutting these sort of deaths in half in the next five years.
0.0	0.025331764812	You find me...
0.0	0.312151368697	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.422345867704	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.

0.0	0.404484998427	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.39381174253	But it is a general economic issue.

0.0	0.412797162549	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.505909417615	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.

0.0	0.189497552677	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.231955237681	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.176116532526	They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there.
0.0	0.223826498922	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.0561138884304	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.248099588507	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.289833148393	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.042336830308	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.5	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.0183092314259	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.375285118653	I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor, I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very, very powerful and most important of all jobs in the United States, the president, whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country.
0.0	0.0637852273487	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.327762890611	We now have that.
0.0	0.0771365119089	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.200653069813	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.206997125826	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.140447141989	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.208875842853	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.597954586971	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.921202542445	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.20799437877	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.458445848994	It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.
0.0	0.0305485971871	They know.
0.0	0.196985405384	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.418196382785	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.372229747232	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.0712367753713	It's not a bestseller.
0.0	0.216431842985	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.231816070517	That's the right of people.
1.0	0.994658950054	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
0.0	0.129904500504	And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave.
0.0	0.0696323050724	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.0276681745201	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.429658267208	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.186756189923	We talked about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.370340798468	And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans.
0.0	0.196277763762	Well, we did have a plan, and I think it's fair to say that of all of the Arab leaders, Gaddafi probably had more blood on his hands of Americans than anybody else.
0.0	0.0415094069272	Well, I did.
0.0	0.182315669395	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.256486448158	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.155361489068	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.473747601885	People died, and only three people have been fired.
0.0	0.202812969351	But what...
0.0	0.352591511692	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.363889701286	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.0617728492999	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.88557129021	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.187545426663	Fact check me.
0.0	0.514981853018	Our staff found information on our computers from the Clinton campaign.
0.0	0.0421017302359	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.110437511611	I'd like to offer a...
0.0	0.410177444736	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.235880686266	I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.
0.0	0.0412559400663	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.469557731531	And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation.
0.0	0.391701945353	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
1.0	0.922252737394	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.201601064262	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.170780305287	But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.
0.0	0.207140987634	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.761869608717	They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?
0.0	0.359820633046	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.
0.0	0.518332489515	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.363814153949	They're a scam.
0.0	0.3960273803	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.551473420207	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.220245762209	When I'm president, that will change.
0.0	0.0395274868586	That's right.
0.0	0.245813784407	Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees.
0.0	0.0642737495232	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.0547651204533	I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
0.0	0.075550261852	But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.307650959736	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.220864117184	And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college.
0.0	0.0107661869329	I hope those are the issues we'll discuss.
0.0	0.554248341157	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.267968985575	We will -- when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice.
0.0	0.285579340409	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.214512760239	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.0685820207435	That is why we need to make...
0.0	0.0570402068719	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.318033905237	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.177811089011	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.308223192997	The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.
0.0	0.258658845638	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.637809264665	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.213642744266	That will change everything.
0.0	0.330013602688	Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.
0.0	0.342925754368	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.
0.0	0.100070967637	They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work.
0.0	0.126883568831	And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.
0.0	0.773019289053	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.434085314779	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.286500498659	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.235989203772	And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work.
0.0	0.23088343094	... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message.
0.0	0.145981971387	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.128622485675	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.0881206214748	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.185349885498	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.0694948293185	There's been no crowd like this.
0.0	0.27370197213	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.0906810260184	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.541673272455	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.491128104275	I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
0.0	0.177069945022	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.444430971065	He hit oil.
0.0	0.0305093793112	You're right.
0.0	0.4220160664	I do not support amnesty...
0.0	0.343433109905	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.279352856764	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.113277428878	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.0151852848811	How great is that?
0.0	0.0692977620953	Washington is broken.
0.0	0.387191867443	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.142798233176	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.517471854988	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.314628086659	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.294976151034	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.37136168846	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.123996546675	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.938329888858	You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56 percent, equivalent to 56 percent of the GDP In America.
0.0	0.150592161653	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.434835076319	When he brought forward the "Gang of Eight" bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.
0.0	0.770795497322	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
0.0	0.602752759012	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.174977507465	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.149303035573	We have made some good progress.
0.0	0.121997773382	I gotta build those big buildings.
0.0	0.173879964039	Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.
0.0	0.275299612375	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.608013301536	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.151094811049	It ain't complicated.
0.0	0.363477395303	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.284211921905	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.128817575111	But states need to do more as well.
0.0	0.34823857426	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.332330062079	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.254486963034	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.0652916494873	And I said, "I know.
0.0	0.399725138577	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.0678618916386	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.267403537368	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.505207509075	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.830300489242	You should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition.
0.0	0.281261402956	And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young, old, everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard.
0.0	0.277491943942	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy.
0.0	0.692120038157	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.295702345698	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.368191933034	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.781569136079	... saying, no middle class tax raises.
0.0	0.303900720043	Against the Republican leadership, who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies.
0.0	0.235588094917	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.129262026334	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.0333360255058	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.311642199424	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.803163742415	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.315669446465	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.236654466808	That's true.
0.0	0.378656342906	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.251650333996	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.51816526968	Furthermore, in a competitive global economy, it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world.
0.0	0.0741327802442	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.477219640727	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.
0.0	0.037042496079	That's crony capitalism.
1.0	0.941150180971	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.478785752978	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.199010326578	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.559370039781	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.908346119849	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.0801218738998	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
0.0	0.0619078231505	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.036957589343	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.0923020277075	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.197158769983	But this is what we also have to say.
0.0	0.547450669305	It was Countrywide Mortgage.

0.0	0.0278367789496	I can do that.
0.0	0.139880196333	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.135783227556	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.63522782418	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.5	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.0395274868586	That's right.
0.0	0.200477569447	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.117749234939	Predominantly African-American and Hispanic.
0.0	0.379693654496	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.0682483130938	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.312464863066	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.124721485915	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.261099628166	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.380724392688	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.122261454259	That's just media stuff.
0.0	0.343705453637	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
0.0	0.525006939173	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.306324237076	But there is a broad consensus on sensible gun safety regulations that I, coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, will do my best to bring together.
0.0	0.307229012731	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.0509134789949	...the only reason is -- look...
0.0	0.304492906581	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.
0.0	0.169417883592	Nobody can do that like me.
0.0	0.15381917185	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.146701305392	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.220424307628	Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said.
0.0	0.28484300735	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.162608205537	A few days ago a similar incident happened.
0.0	0.208358117941	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.148133783233	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.180573818512	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.973943444613	We got $18 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.117575969347	I said, "They send it back?"
0.0	0.0217331191045	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.595239054506	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.288604440618	Planned Parenthood will be defunded.
0.0	0.912958859157	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.172097937115	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.517618934255	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.320369233741	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
0.0	0.059480568106	I waited and I got the scars to show for it.
0.0	0.155742268558	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.160240307058	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.224056743054	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.135255984385	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
1.0	0.987822359725	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.298841753666	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.142483277391	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.178077303987	And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.
0.0	0.0685985118705	They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
0.0	0.139978793543	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.
0.0	0.363027578077	You read about all the companies now that are doing business -- about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on.
0.0	0.148274806324	They're building up their military to a point that is very scary.
0.0	0.505578551038	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.384448667285	If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship.
0.0	0.569548358125	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.0714794625265	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.0865161211734	We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets.
0.0	0.553490259181	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.093828754518	Because we don't want them in and out -- we don't want them in and out of the prisons.
0.0	0.202812969351	We do.
0.0	0.372187540987	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.487534428027	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.150569843319	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.19161386335	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.053046634024	Yeah.
0.0	0.362522131748	And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
0.0	0.274799696024	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.264322062543	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.105569586059	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.
0.0	0.0830508401674	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.266121664742	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.403863940952	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.106228537022	Yeah, but let me respond...
0.0	0.132810768923	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.347444384294	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.00791438484351	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.0516788732183	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.816258741243	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.139126759458	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.380923889732	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.202812969351	No.
0.0	0.878570810884	But -- but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages.
0.0	0.424057903297	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
0.0	0.392813328615	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.341641075812	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.0356048604742	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.
0.0	0.687989809851	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.301157026374	And so, you go the extra mile.
0.0	0.290996919462	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.10903725526	Who do you know will defend life, marriage and religious liberty?
0.0	0.186030703361	And they don't know -- "Are you running?
0.0	0.43476568497	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.353810976474	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.145047899425	When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal?
0.0	0.288436951243	This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along.
0.0	0.619935948562	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.065417782932	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.0598885515541	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.438603507618	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.0937107452533	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.154733107909	Yes, let's tell the truth, Martin.
0.0	0.0605810340288	The problem is...
0.0	0.0470963112561	Look, I served on...
0.0	0.510025602398	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.428123949809	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.253381898589	It's coming from more than Mexico.
1.0	0.764552232645	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.270920217997	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.557926160027	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.201078517344	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0818944423458	We want to build on it and fix it.
0.0	0.0856446108902	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.543987509203	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.222990400663	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.146313995581	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.133588779031	Now they're going militarily.
0.0	0.273462696597	It's poor people and middle class.
1.0	0.301381202519	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.61904458989	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.387687841005	... First of all -- Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.212151694185	And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016.
0.0	0.405422026262	...eliminates the business...
1.0	0.927121562205	It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate.
0.0	0.253743612589	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.31117526217	I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country.
0.0	0.0844953884828	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.143090588276	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.0983361983226	But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything -- everything, they got away with it again.
0.0	0.275277653648	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.168516398724	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.152055662724	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.074659097354	So I don't think...
0.0	0.0307187923292	Alright.
0.0	0.342151762008	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
1.0	0.977375978944	And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph).
0.0	0.0721109383649	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.579552364015	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.187473509442	And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them.
0.0	0.074659097354	No, I don't think so.
0.0	0.037225468049	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.305779597376	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.140253771641	I (inaudible).
0.0	0.194704449819	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.776260636996	He's actually a negative force.
0.0	0.376927291163	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.188694574904	You can change your mind.
0.0	0.427919803233	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.154309230131	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.363814153949	They're a scam.
0.0	0.11923420695	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.341786483956	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.145871392651	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.767883343829	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
0.0	0.117971585021	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.264546759953	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.156651208965	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.488775628738	I think it's fair to say that Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America, but the issue is...
0.0	0.143358250466	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.160216628431	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.371961188515	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.883224871496	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.436134036978	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.315691015462	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.33355021532	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.597146889604	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.189059852789	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
0.0	0.170381265727	What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger.
0.0	0.513773274423	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.523912169555	And it will have effects in the private market.
0.0	0.37090992027	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.531927251455	She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.488410023868	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.

0.0	0.0440506380143	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.207669078477	Can I share this quick story?
0.0	0.089674047599	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.0514388780246	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.202812969351	These...
0.0	0.58411508146	For over 200 years, America's light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again.
0.0	0.12161306953	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.282283456219	I'll advertise my Web site as well.
0.0	0.0588848694184	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.255444502018	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.286153155182	Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.
0.0	0.318801072979	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.380882503065	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.181208050821	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.239800713705	Well, I just think you're asking a question with a false choice.
0.0	0.210360566787	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.161400120304	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.0387971747443	May I respond?
0.0	0.250798382112	So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.
0.0	0.634929042733	It wasn't the bill that I wanted, but yet it turned out to be one of the more significant pieces of veterans' legislation passed in recent history.
0.0	0.0470905636482	We have nothing.
0.0	0.488964240477	We have to do away with the strawman proposal.
0.0	0.247779592468	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.300133388962	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.0777729715118	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.120720465092	So, so important.
0.0	0.156692690417	Now, it's very interesting.
1.0	0.990334169621	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.17602311435	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.0250268685918	I love the Saudis.
0.0	0.215070171644	And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage.
0.0	0.0460352555931	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.431748600131	We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.
0.0	0.284308378888	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.12143850648	We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.
0.0	0.335975224065	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.428323131598	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.161997992459	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
1.0	0.994291029905	Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world.
0.0	0.263722268494	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.227719103959	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.173310915278	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.155195573023	Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.
1.0	0.797897173423	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.198695237967	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.218685173861	We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.
0.0	0.087062689819	You just can't do it.
0.0	0.0365672479027	We're dying.
0.0	0.429900282363	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.157152381877	You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.
0.0	0.144421595126	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.311480401654	And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, "if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed.
0.0	0.78414945722	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.0773505941981	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
0.0	0.56036573464	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...
0.0	0.140732727767	I said, "I gotta go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.0811047564884	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.872269167253	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.224440795466	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.344113411197	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.217646893649	Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint.
0.0	0.395852593163	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.275020809294	You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now -- it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run.
0.0	0.521633046346	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.181005052519	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.105588698649	And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem.
0.0	0.163066060992	Sadly, the American dream is dead.
0.0	0.146550820549	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.285270727793	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.144393440743	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.197806537864	That means everything.
0.0	0.421610714972	They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.996049317161	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.861619052988	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.0982506412276	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.322667588309	I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.
0.0	0.217865005294	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.154167979221	And most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that.
0.0	0.0418383975714	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.400060872954	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.440196059777	Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
0.0	0.25834896384	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.75566555962	In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.
0.0	0.284434081945	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
0.0	0.0408960835215	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.0900537477245	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.118892168021	Check it out.
0.0	0.0233247268507	I like it.
0.0	0.312892276676	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.229761717463	You've got to be on top of it.
0.0	0.367778132588	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.652136647148	It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English.
0.0	0.590421603498	We both want to get more revenue in.
1.0	0.999996710332	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.0888807521948	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.0600950746048	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.0737990330059	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.104268434547	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.464639771349	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.347593001878	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.195105305542	They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do.
0.0	0.112860879328	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.283216275383	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
1.0	0.0158795214092	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.456697093626	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.119858929516	Our next president...
0.0	0.103206958782	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
1.0	0.791331610041	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.118000682351	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.17668798229	If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs.
0.0	0.152403395039	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.32736035764	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.426600950855	And the U.S. chamber of commerce, which hardly ever says nice things about Democratic governors anywhere, named our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship.
0.0	0.216832523904	If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration.
0.0	0.104745396262	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.155099194736	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.244709022628	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.382037658946	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
1.0	0.997325184624	In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship.
0.0	0.151238119402	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.0851718341465	In this building, in Trump Tower.
0.0	0.123451901739	So Ford will come back.
0.0	0.568244642226	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.3445837734	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.188113238401	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.156000726713	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
0.0	0.0650010604685	And I think that's a mistake, and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways.
0.0	0.391669015346	They're not supporting our law enforcement officers, it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you're a law enforcement officer.
1.0	0.991178095159	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.278024318527	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.700239174534	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.918532065577	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.0124539871258	They're great.
0.0	0.0415094069272	... Well, no, no.
0.0	0.0832962095187	I beat China all the time.
0.0	0.15740548293	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.202752942477	Yes.
0.0	0.0722198097606	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.0278367789496	We can do that.
0.0	0.756974183976	And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.
0.0	0.351997376212	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.206995886063	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
0.0	0.212039465957	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.293833586957	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.124102410505	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.080030402266	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.467088697835	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.284689982082	Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS.
0.0	0.269275568967	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.152456323491	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.5	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.267858578564	... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.271526822417	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.399401258321	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.394381964298	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.105210763695	And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president.
0.0	0.270868230062	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.133739823924	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.137431060755	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.895906563806	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.72268943212	That's American citizenship.
0.0	0.181654792539	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.248543128782	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.369134518368	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.0937333144703	Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, "Sorry, fellas.
0.0	0.18901599763	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
1.0	0.963967846545	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.22478085173	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.0062201365513	I feel like...
0.0	0.0414602057318	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.
0.0	0.483719293266	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.260585214952	But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding.
0.0	0.161296061784	I don't have to brag.
0.0	0.39239630796	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.358959235965	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.108673204295	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
1.0	0.886012387613	The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.
0.0	0.248640834317	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.185609684243	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.156642716221	Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home.
0.0	0.236669972476	Border security has always been a part of that debate.
0.0	0.0737211564934	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.363132983797	In the 1980s, it was in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Reagan's administration, and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel, and others were murdered.
0.0	0.0848570563636	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.365660543532	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.
0.0	0.333329707018	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.284075317283	It's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement.
0.0	0.0982751156695	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.237089132171	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.265015724703	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.186586678495	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.0260670558025	You know, the situation is this.
0.0	0.224674933939	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.135951998334	... family leave for a very long time...
0.0	0.480924267614	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.0869653772976	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.654519757174	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.302336713247	I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider.
0.0	0.41038440381	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.187426655084	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.161945661363	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.16917703638	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.212505728047	It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible.
0.0	0.15316441762	Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.0854780550068	John, I think somewhere between...
0.0	0.202812969351	No.
0.0	0.710639333158	This is revolutionary for education in America.
0.0	0.416064055672	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
1.0	0.878206924785	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.277187368113	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.126287678139	But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said.
0.0	0.537259006914	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.00918579574724	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.268895525417	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.162001116623	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
1.0	0.328959856173	When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.148805379243	That's not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.
0.0	0.343399986344	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.198588846016	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.411568118223	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.237262444137	And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.
0.0	0.264421572211	This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.
0.0	0.202752942477	Yes.
0.0	0.841316085563	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.174339969173	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.303004892895	I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.
0.0	0.657572527134	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.304261910097	... and we will end the illegal immigration.
0.0	0.358200513217	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.304864000202	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.468124460281	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.159767236828	They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.
0.0	0.512901395035	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.0848064098354	He didn't know.
0.0	0.253743612589	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?

0.0	0.103216443587	You see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, I'm an optimist
0.0	0.267620054144	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.0287415259532	I'll say this.
0.0	0.141022427551	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.
0.0	0.0867850453096	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.202812969351	What do we do?
0.0	0.154881273102	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.354819967002	And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.216007302771	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.239833687581	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.207881936798	They will never make America great again.
0.0	0.0920105574897	I said, "how's it going?"
0.0	0.319140212968	And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.
0.0	0.303853638961	Please become part of the political revolution.
0.0	0.642571267463	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.36431026895	ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.
0.0	0.419767685072	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.148800087612	I'm going to tell you -- thank you.
0.0	0.0974054053646	I know the bad ones.
0.0	0.209887780041	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.104484560229	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.611684992471	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.122532406803	Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen?
0.0	0.926694682689	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.909351237829	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.195308298655	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.0493174571821	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.538258858167	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.00962776247043	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.376161099497	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.679836451294	Of course.
0.0	0.229550875625	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
1.0	0.262801588238	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.396718876514	If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out.
0.0	0.185716200406	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.
0.0	0.596605248073	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.678762520669	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.
0.0	0.320581920838	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0324002369476	... issues they have to respond to.
0.0	0.122279637999	And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
0.0	0.292446681793	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
0.0	0.245361676362	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.166514598886	Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate.
1.0	0.995805192501	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.533537211275	We can make a stronger program.
1.0	0.594393371304	$10.10 was all I could get the state to do by the time I left in my last year.
1.0	0.853689195432	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.368678870563	But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone.
0.0	0.280840924862	We ought to send used equipment, right?
0.0	0.268246491402	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.381848828424	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.202251601123	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.286627862289	I saw Ted Cruz say, "we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill."
0.0	0.0221825436569	It feels different.
0.0	0.125324576498	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.477766534847	What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people.
0.0	0.197500739937	I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran.
0.0	0.223607063413	It will give hope to millions of young people.
0.0	0.925390088045	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.175021194294	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.528038875357	Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.
0.0	0.36519458267	And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years.
0.0	0.286587833737	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.134272020982	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.0854459557219	You really can't.
0.0	0.140768907975	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.0993577650535	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.282181677512	I don't know and with all due respect to the secretary, Wall Street played by the rules?
0.0	0.0598985720311	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.219884170168	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
1.0	0.159131783118	He's not wall street.
0.0	0.244789236672	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.331739424782	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.743125016217	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
0.0	0.449700442014	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.663092276115	When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish Glass-Stegall.
0.0	0.29533085976	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.467440722602	And for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.
0.0	0.108976911752	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.390610913785	But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.
0.0	0.265067420416	He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing?
0.0	0.253714938338	I've done an amazing job.
0.0	0.0901316352469	I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.
0.0	0.266739685031	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.0836363777796	I've gotta do it."
0.0	0.554000108439	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.14264990685	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.362375357814	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.351575530774	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.202812969351	Not at all.
0.0	0.784501282747	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.160298146049	And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.
0.0	0.396685614866	By the way, no nation on earth is more generous than America is.
0.0	0.33356695507	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
1.0	0.999999937277	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.0487925791013	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.106039853324	Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.
0.0	0.10813266176	I was there and I saw the debate.
0.0	0.0395274868586	Right?
0.0	0.217257111919	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.190288362221	And it has three parts.
0.0	0.137051945097	And we need the right people.
0.0	0.390048001041	In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, "Donald, you don't have enough borrowings.
0.0	0.259564403606	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
0.0	0.132769068252	And what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.233340763483	We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
0.0	0.448668986029	It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested.
0.0	0.366619199449	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.519774767831	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.386902743655	And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow.
0.0	0.329465365355	But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.0959141148354	It is ISIS.
0.0	0.471033224372	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.0166630619335	They will not.
0.0	0.901367324504	We're spending over $600 billion a year on the military and yet, significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism.
0.0	0.0283362678777	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.180722881831	As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe.
0.0	0.188698274754	Germany, many other countries do it already.
0.0	0.172423710048	It cannot be contained, it must be defeated.
0.0	0.415264047794	It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.
0.0	0.0615323131783	And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?
0.0	0.271675892609	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.202812969351	That is...
0.0	0.444400114199	The first vote hasn't been counted.
0.0	0.463992936219	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.
0.0	0.346026068711	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.649600431981	But here, a total net worth of -- net worth, not assets, not -- a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets -- Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York -- many other places all over the world.
0.0	0.402491878853	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
0.0	0.0804467023004	Let me just...
0.0	0.232956081005	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.379232592263	There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America.
0.0	0.174129136279	How has it worked?
0.0	0.952240153546	It costs me $3.

0.0	0.565083096803	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.36840194249	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.507116042943	First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster.
0.0	0.0150971501806	But I learned a lot.
0.0	0.182370919111	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.22746788255	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.266005392936	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.378943179938	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...
0.0	0.330605817964	And I have to tell you, I would not want -- if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my health care.
0.0	0.068369745313	You're simply not.
0.0	0.5	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.450032650801	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.124357610199	It's called the politics.
0.0	0.305016306308	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.588150613765	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.305830717275	But, of course, international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today.
0.0	0.407343366388	Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer.
0.0	0.000923964826666	But look...
0.0	0.142196414881	And I -- I thought, if I didn't jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this.
0.0	0.634901012086	But at the end of the day, what you have right now are millions of Americans working two or three jobs because their wages that they are earning are just too low.
0.0	0.152607366941	But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here.
0.0	0.954786828173	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.0621381724547	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.2723020427	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.410542162206	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.273862792187	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.102847169053	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.241762909402	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.0959834882342	It's a joke.
0.0	0.258213387701	So, in terms of refugees, I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe, with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that, of course, we reach out.
0.0	0.13605795205	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.663213361032	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.234942440158	And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people.
0.0	0.286303471891	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.523017199971	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.580351430979	Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.
0.0	0.152048315014	There were parts of that bill which agree with parts -- I disagree.
0.0	0.155178031348	You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911.
0.0	0.243174534439	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.257210697126	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.314326198439	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.223563806405	Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.
0.0	0.311127898515	I spent a lot of time in the situation room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us.
0.0	0.0588658830735	It's real estate.
0.0	0.197689574922	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.293823606414	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.856873851124	People have been paying it for years.
0.0	0.261116107263	We actually did it.
0.0	0.363783471028	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.116120589354	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.15095230716	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.426431900803	That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive.
0.0	0.161419789069	I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.
0.0	0.433131720544	A lot of the rights that have been won over years, from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights, will be at risk.
0.0	0.0689358989604	That's who I'm indebted to.
1.0	0.995686599503	But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.
0.0	0.142409174411	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.202812969351	That's what it is.
0.0	0.275712991341	But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.
0.0	0.096532604248	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.202193396445	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.17786936538	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.714409216548	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.146881665704	We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
0.0	0.135494285435	And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.
0.0	0.334854156524	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.295577469203	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.397356104661	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.31649014835	I think the issue here is -- and I applaud Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.305920145802	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.0777923587515	And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.
1.0	0.547136771038	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.247213007645	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.0502731534641	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.261140585176	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.264113732908	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.323573496101	Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region.
0.0	0.41929763897	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.202752942477	Yes.
0.0	0.147314446083	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.384154519446	Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors.
0.0	0.35465656273	We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt.
0.0	0.0861632501688	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.441885507185	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.251787248401	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.776940496064	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.328196897367	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.11267110913	I want security.
0.0	0.18282953919	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.0523327714447	We get Bergdahl.
0.0	0.19959565803	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.253650358691	But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.
0.0	0.184489212335	We have losers.
0.0	0.660304924667	It'll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there's no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.
0.0	0.237617977419	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.
0.0	0.144450412368	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.136267634025	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.0179252279487	There is no other description of it.
1.0	0.7803606225	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
0.0	0.0116937783329	You looking at me?
0.0	0.409641883092	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.0119112701681	Maria...
0.0	0.187061179706	How does that help us?  TRUMP R 15 94 1 N Where is that good?
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.332221475012	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.0498264700009	A step forward.
0.0	0.0732290335842	OK...
0.0	0.397720896691	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.750569001988	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.691876793801	I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money.
1.0	0.999999748775	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.892884348704	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.311149804201	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.385704802615	That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable.
0.0	0.2366099357	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.171493461861	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.120724927393	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.107632195289	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.128628749622	I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path.
0.0	0.159778981237	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.
0.0	0.210812561603	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.288757727943	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.231201712168	People who we should be welcoming and working with.
0.0	0.616539922049	Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.
1.0	0.992229891644	I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance.
0.0	0.348764049156	Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons.
0.0	0.17371440343	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.557136039949	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.15324287096	I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
0.0	0.309727553116	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.345316392566	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.124725824813	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.0292264284197	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.156742827369	I've been to Ferguson, I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.
0.0	0.178865270707	So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
0.0	0.493182005414	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.160448676674	And, you know, I don't know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done.
0.0	0.27188260388	I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to -- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.
0.0	0.358617100434	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.0964181533897	Well, I've got news for you, we can.
0.0	0.158480978136	... we will secure the border...
0.0	0.0673038442504	Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
0.0	0.0455655792569	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.202812969351	No, you did.
0.0	0.954467866461	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.122370643494	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.167854505748	I believe that the goal should be debt-free college.
0.0	0.097255465926	We saw a dictator overthrown.
1.0	0.815858842827	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.393494811343	Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare?
0.0	0.233441215317	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.
0.0	0.186952516495	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.5401513943	And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.
0.0	0.300675921715	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.51055418402	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.376460590231	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.155757848689	I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs.
0.0	0.359586307743	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.437085171866	So I said, "That's OK." I'm proud of my net worth.
0.0	0.173906775267	And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China.
0.0	0.315573869274	Saudi Arabia without us is gone.
0.0	0.615840670346	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.12238310714	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.43287533183	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.108294344389	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.0906271723093	Look, the secretary is right.
0.0	0.140253771641	Then (inaudible)...
0.0	0.486911959398	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.354995844589	And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't."
0.0	0.160031118846	We know about the French.
0.0	0.104713178621	Our vets are being treated horribly.
1.0	0.464788036566	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.26089835045	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.
0.0	0.261116107263	We actually did it.
0.0	0.398198621146	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.0223434456694	I think what is...
0.0	0.173046456557	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.453523764428	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.384635179548	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.211919176622	But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future.
1.0	0.965717533126	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.200781663244	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.233753934558	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
0.0	0.312833190008	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.146126493686	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
0.0	0.382312729889	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.0544999688992	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.276511068431	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.259883249731	... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.
0.0	0.106818524087	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.5	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.0571846529596	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.123632522865	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.379914890297	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.199197624089	You cannot grant amnesty.
0.0	0.218986833678	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.0464096693605	No, they shouldn't.
0.0	0.417557067971	And, I would not that there's a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that's the EPA's blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline.
0.0	0.198710470394	Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.
0.0	0.353138019675	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.183875782441	We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.
0.0	0.171988250168	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.226800788586	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.206445524787	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.404607767153	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?
0.0	0.308277007719	We have people that aren't smart.
0.0	0.619840891394	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.5	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
0.0	0.330401157713	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.545304378668	We can end welfare for those here illegally.
0.0	0.0571486007457	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.363256261776	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.386642817729	When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.
0.0	0.214367439972	Both served.
0.0	0.463997171316	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.264569129783	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.462869823553	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.156770818219	We don't win.
0.0	0.0612326052411	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.313937189452	I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.
0.0	0.163042230576	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.0783718241447	Oh.
0.0	0.438838040299	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.0214947244676	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.0608296084558	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.234803164788	And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.
0.0	0.301337710106	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.435128616971	But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.
0.0	0.447636438434	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.10545702665	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
1.0	0.99142124518	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.27336082548	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.145121641335	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.122329865055	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.479661710362	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.310634053505	And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.
0.0	0.0911804734602	I'm really rich.
0.0	0.24389799312	Ford.
0.0	0.168261442731	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.207710284171	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.0305485971871	I know.
0.0	0.179603557044	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.823483017772	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.250393992372	And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go.
0.0	0.464192219368	You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization.
0.0	0.230603031636	Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves.
0.0	0.273122267745	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
1.0	0.175237730815	They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us.
0.0	0.293997601243	Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.
0.0	0.358387652282	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.162606917461	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.279187751827	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
0.0	0.560459874514	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.0917185772234	Our vets may see the V.A.
0.0	0.281090106243	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.254533507011	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.053046634024	Yeah.
0.0	0.0359068737718	But you know what else they're anxious about?
0.0	0.865539309336	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.200030801792	Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris.
0.0	0.10267923908	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.347385909856	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.312669952263	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.199422770374	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.136257670626	We need to end minimal sentencing.
0.0	0.42363796591	They're going to take away thousands of jobs.
0.0	0.269707975381	And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that.
0.0	0.153609086262	I don't think a halt is necessary.
0.0	0.379626121756	Secretary Clinton is right.
0.0	0.293823606414	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.141451772407	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.183932398466	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.45121244032	And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq.
0.0	0.239665635614	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.0285643971796	It can happen.
0.0	0.22005966513	You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down.
0.0	0.294032271578	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.102172155332	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.240383183559	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.208178781551	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.297458410236	We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.194508648617	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.0560438929133	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.0694631161042	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.475131777004	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.0714637609395	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.12492369927	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.059695644225	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
0.0	0.872003236906	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.310623288547	... and I think -- you know, Governor -- Jeb, you -- the attack that -- the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS.
0.0	0.0395274868586	Right.
0.0	0.223845565411	So we need people -- I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.100331368016	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.210373630019	He said, "Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."
0.0	0.654829213616	The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress.
1.0	0.837777776335	In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.
0.0	0.433470768205	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.347269084195	It is enormously complicated.
0.0	0.202812969351	Why is it...
0.0	0.592145152684	I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons.
0.0	0.440512603676	Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
0.0	0.514361319938	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.747327414319	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.105002145472	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.333709983413	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.0296129349525	I have a wonderful family.
0.0	0.309692502498	And the last piece is this.
1.0	0.399519684219	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.0954072935464	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.293199645913	It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control.
0.0	0.376989566061	That's the secondary issue.
0.0	0.17576752486	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.554704332361	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.151360048712	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.353611932765	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.20149569709	How stupid are our leaders?
0.0	0.0852729490572	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.133434599244	Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name.
0.0	0.189361794925	Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day.
0.0	0.306696776054	Not only -- not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton -- and I hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- I want to apologize to my supporters.
0.0	0.0806329830185	But I would add this.
0.0	0.0287415259532	He'll say.
0.0	0.313134883317	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.0395274868586	That's right.
0.0	0.27957042341	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.478842312071	I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of State, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now.
0.0	0.328788009114	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.0269052022947	No vision at all.
0.0	0.371848830014	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.0776933742534	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.254286572643	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.254747753181	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.112533170506	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.599042044469	There is broad consensus, 92 percent in the most recently poll of Americans want gun safety measures...
0.0	0.341914484577	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.4665549807	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.311431266408	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.107213833309	We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear.
0.0	0.77534101789	Why is it that we are spending per capita far, far more than Canada, which is 100 miles away from my door, that guarantees health care to all people?
0.0	0.372795631816	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.0979171581185	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.0607825064558	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.0747642376992	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.289617772359	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.472604748328	That is some group of people.
0.0	0.202812969351	What do we do?
0.0	0.588395188313	I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.183881785415	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
1.0	0.768315366281	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.0432095368678	... but wait a minute...
0.0	0.387541726579	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
0.0	0.269451710319	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.162104305011	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.575245609357	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.115118163691	Not bad.
0.0	0.257736805886	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.23597128319	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.195504208695	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.490751992383	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.119160352129	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.188235738327	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.151399134658	That would be a disaster for this country.
0.0	0.120498619358	That was a terrible mistake.
0.0	0.117625572326	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.862447131052	If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.
0.0	0.107829676397	I would just...
0.0	0.211088478597	You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question.
0.0	0.655214985455	Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force.
0.0	0.0131983535119	They're off to China.
0.0	0.391168404582	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.193399242842	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.771146099219	We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations.
0.0	0.356156957804	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.174896795998	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.191857708239	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
0.0	0.432058945373	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.0473406943449	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.632259115865	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.132865876298	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.
0.0	0.24457607303	And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.
0.0	0.201429657328	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.0635613532734	I believe we've got to go further.
0.0	0.367232927971	And, also, acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration, and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners.
0.0	0.121267854411	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.364641170163	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.376133928781	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.167803513279	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.
0.0	0.311523269123	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.448044149087	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
0.0	0.0992840804456	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.0786534283045	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.0568394227554	Listen, we can solve immigration.
0.0	0.33945251422	I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up.
0.0	0.107783359011	Well, thanks for having me.
0.0	0.206629217415	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
1.0	0.661582695852	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.179067653846	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.0732290335842	OK?
0.0	0.161114878814	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.0197076779388	So we need 1,000.

0.0	0.153310327236	And I think has had a big impact.
0.0	0.247100418346	And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.
0.0	0.173685012295	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.210424769822	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.21826392613	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.191725615794	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
0.0	0.203616334681	I would like to start with a basic.

0.0	0.266481453851	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.178097317696	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.479919025415	We can in fact create jobs and provide job security.
0.0	0.108970132073	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.485615347541	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.245811483374	What our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as Americans.
0.0	0.179402286601	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.425438783548	I mean, my dad went to college on a G.I.
0.0	0.421280281281	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.

1.0	0.34360950236	It's never below zero.
0.0	0.558058707802	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
1.0	0.995963096178	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
0.0	0.505334993245	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.208266844696	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.11959580623	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.480819395006	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.164411838917	There must be some way.
0.0	0.14350586333	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.296427479788	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.

0.0	0.2850325013	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.612376413573	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.304479078978	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.214403459693	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.506424919028	We have to end -- education has to be local.
0.0	0.373579050293	What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS.
0.0	0.16322694716	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.0496251455463	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.311658255627	My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.
0.0	0.244912107768	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.288124221473	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.0710667419011	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
1.0	0.999985490657	So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education.
0.0	0.0435804276146	I can't do it.
0.0	0.202812969351	But...
0.0	0.249735551258	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.255090213979	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.168515462614	There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out.
0.0	0.241302507183	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.580081169785	I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
0.0	0.356359510705	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.0821131765305	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.134069499381	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...
0.0	0.274049529394	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.283789759106	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.0973374015851	That's the difference.
0.0	0.150089228884	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.237797740195	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.282997157814	John, I would disagree with Secretary Clinton respectfully on this score.
0.0	0.198176895167	And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting.
0.0	0.222510574579	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.0216959167081	Sure did.
0.0	0.168829134259	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.0789177883255	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.23068394275	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.0140447476395	I like China.
0.0	0.443621830024	Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
1.0	0.991026079213	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.116307754766	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.341449703379	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.192627215192	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.289355924841	These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy, and our economic power in alignment with our principles.
0.0	0.423618985776	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.243470794921	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.0742430499116	Don't believe it.
0.0	0.256275616027	Yeah (ph), no, I think that's a -- that's a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques.
0.0	0.139296051181	We must able to work collaboratively with others.
0.0	0.315601894861	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.210335308405	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.184528308436	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.212944190203	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.0960607521072	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.248811693135	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.572156577686	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.230027935639	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.171095442727	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.171313510386	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.474251941534	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.405638535262	I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done.
0.0	0.908824327554	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.266172598662	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.154543408551	Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope.
0.0	0.135996456387	I say, "That's a terrible story.
0.0	0.335387123054	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.0884205354492	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.221316849052	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.979692404155	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.245577708054	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.295631868467	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
1.0	0.826633603434	The Republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times.
0.0	0.0246683531874	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.0973130524079	We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression.
0.0	0.180615041837	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.296689635626	I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
0.0	0.278148583098	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.274926372624	It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them.
0.0	0.175498883746	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.20454923396	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.161098587846	I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?
0.0	0.391146788925	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.122520696854	I know every one.
0.0	0.0223434456694	Kathie, I think -- Kathie the...
0.0	0.161086645939	The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.
0.0	0.121509853737	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.114794089041	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.692440305165	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.223233361095	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
0.0	0.221988759877	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
0.0	0.0598671856205	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.0704894785309	Can I just say this...
0.0	0.566595512628	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.198916544046	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.
0.0	0.527807288541	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.426623428227	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.222827555058	We were wrong.
0.0	0.202812969351	...
1.0	0.724844870078	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.208796446012	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.0330691221838	So you might not.
0.0	0.23469456132	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.112849064974	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.252095721152	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.166625933686	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.0504034177075	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.152618062617	Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.218386289601	He's the one that did Bergdahl.
0.0	0.0623233358334	We don't know anything about that.
1.0	0.928832080392	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.0606072643892	Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down.
0.0	0.353477240145	I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.
0.0	0.781807809373	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.179372155907	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.132345294202	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.619738383238	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.157864104446	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.285282419052	At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically.
0.0	0.145452765303	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.489824556613	He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter.
0.0	0.37182448925	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.
1.0	0.973750238793	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.0660028100568	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
0.0	0.0110070653637	So did you, Marco.
0.0	0.253540059891	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.387241457879	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.427794362217	But you know what we did in Maryland?
0.0	0.5	Ever.
0.0	0.186096926503	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
0.0	0.066494760021	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.678236342871	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.0762029358428	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.267543715792	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.197253304189	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.0216959167081	He sure did.
0.0	0.328115915477	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.46023674228	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.0883793980321	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.0610743583692	I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.
0.0	0.145955295393	They are ripping us.
0.0	0.874793299916	Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978.
0.0	0.237014679307	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
1.0	0.986644381902	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.0437342733472	I really am.
0.0	0.0963544315029	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.312279841401	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.941053956506	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.314243843391	And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.
0.0	0.189999474308	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.152208443359	So I have nothing at all critical of him.

0.0	0.108016335386	Go ahead.
0.0	0.31826717939	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.0402842140366	They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
0.0	0.0702626361308	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.

0.0	0.124635365276	They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it."
0.0	0.211027867397	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.17744742574	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.223194583365	With all -- with all due respect...
0.0	0.227926801207	This entire question was an attack, but that's (inaudible)
0.0	0.557291094277	In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.
0.0	0.559024533073	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.685238238712	Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.
0.0	0.273754142592	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.157438880816	David, thank you.
0.0	0.33973620963	Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization called ISIS.
0.0	0.272478402714	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.116731754735	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.742700996473	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.62081054495	But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
0.0	0.186955186283	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.685623896658	We've enacted it in our state.
0.0	0.913792707102	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.103320117836	Somebody said, "Oh, that's crass."
0.0	0.376763482704	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.603575596122	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.582364522515	But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance.
0.0	0.163775011554	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.151360168043	He couldn't answer the question.
0.0	0.822518586849	We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.
0.0	0.410292616298	But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.
0.0	0.322398602713	That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities.
0.0	0.487525423147	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.47008057644	This nation is the most powerful military in the world.
0.0	0.311632907711	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.277625660556	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.360900780196	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.190474517984	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.114445117456	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.122127532292	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.0758112555077	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.173120139783	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.
0.0	0.0882116911599	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.386024572162	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
0.0	0.425100862329	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.570346340025	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
1.0	0.825152875057	We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.258682603976	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.142436170671	Many are in this building.
0.0	0.854730860772	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.551290447487	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.950463560979	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.138366207777	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
0.0	0.519736449272	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
1.0	0.740798314742	And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent.
0.0	0.157564347278	And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...
0.0	0.109911281806	But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting.
0.0	0.111193052739	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.318789981048	And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.
0.0	0.266924714519	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.310131802553	You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.
0.0	0.96646507447	So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion.
0.0	0.540233425116	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.106883370806	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.221576235591	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.197658709007	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.187133101339	So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
0.0	0.646356611376	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.240397273525	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.0722653180335	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.30591814186	I'm not using donors.
0.0	0.35565476978	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.207721017098	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.204416046587	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.158543280143	I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.
0.0	0.225855886937	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.692483320108	And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.
0.0	0.0745794244468	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
0.0	0.117079811225	But I guess the final thing that -- that I would say is this is the kind of debate we need to take to the Republicans in the fall.
1.0	0.79431136191	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.217507977473	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.202812969351	No.
0.0	0.64716966904	And then on top of that, we've got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are pouring huge sums of money into super PACS heavily influencing the political process.
0.0	0.551107919153	We need, basically, to pledge that we're going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.
0.0	0.118497899951	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.174960287436	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.151275689556	I would prioritize them.
0.0	0.286730099961	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.0862558754626	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.206461585291	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.193024100185	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.251102525156	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.
0.0	0.168621367339	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.0843906274279	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.304224337711	If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W. Bush made after 9/11 when he basically said after going to a Mosque in Washington, we are not at war with Islam or Muslims.
0.0	0.225774750753	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.0703571244783	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.101615746739	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.124124956424	Super PACs are a disaster.
1.0	0.840035337514	People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.
0.0	0.522545867555	I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border."
0.0	0.260744507176	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.203592531015	They've got nothing but money.
0.0	0.109774886919	But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that.
0.0	0.298582972249	John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL, and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening.
0.0	0.80465675874	Not assets."
0.0	0.0395274868586	Right.
0.0	0.0510618691897	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.202989826712	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.0279239240003	I happen to think...
0.0	0.637696991895	I also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees.
1.0	0.999999998972	Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.
0.0	0.233428198916	You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that.
0.0	0.19745882402	What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria, when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family you'd better get out now.
1.0	0.912889182737	I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.
0.0	0.030266285315	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.167081322201	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.276123875595	Of course the United States must lead.
0.0	0.448672702434	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.124214526199	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
0.0	0.118205094105	What have you got now?
0.0	0.0693748416289	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.202812969351	Why?
0.0	0.617269710036	And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.
0.0	0.674284874735	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.56086240744	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.19433115965	Well, I got it for two reasons.
0.0	0.247260115509	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.0767026173898	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.0912804280874	Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.
0.0	0.934399211013	You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent.
0.0	0.0503112115724	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.194924251498	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.0928052408436	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.127674021702	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.239514775994	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.870310224658	I voted against the war.
0.0	0.141370225717	Our country has tremendous potential.
0.0	0.407910795494	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.0947730728054	So I've watched the politicians.
0.0	0.440600622604	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.0188832149655	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.331801738388	And people are saying, "What's going on?
0.0	0.219340652727	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.082833784243	John, may I -- may I interject here?
0.0	0.0961133277319	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.237898758582	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.264913430614	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.0616960312499	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.458995314283	My oldest daughter's a teacher.
0.0	0.879326439939	Those hedge funds.
0.0	0.39629890387	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.0873047150627	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.0288632968765	And, look, there are profound differences...
1.0	0.995630222788	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
0.0	0.202812969351	And...
0.0	0.130866687224	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.391719388652	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.304684677638	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.596245718591	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.0179085221979	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.80738872068	But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.
0.0	0.0476785659914	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.13151201192	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.40236016206	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.053046634024	Yeah.
0.0	0.0809783389278	Let's...
0.0	0.210288078647	I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.169474477079	I...
0.0	0.312830162786	And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.
0.0	0.266507548261	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
1.0	0.99245085218	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.197693412398	But those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort.
0.0	0.381103746415	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.658848496439	We were the first to pass a minimum wage.
0.0	0.157732878132	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.034252727391	Fine, I'll take it.
0.0	0.097292902022	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.202812969351	It is.
0.0	0.5	In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men.
1.0	0.766627997375	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.132032667402	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.0912941686377	There will be a process.
0.0	0.333251621819	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.149201101048	I am the son and grandson of immigrants.
0.0	0.412703095602	And in 19 -- and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said -- and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever.
0.0	0.535439496537	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
1.0	0.918621440911	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.251231454983	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.219500834104	Terrorism in this country scares everyone.
0.0	0.158466063864	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.485534147519	People were just being fined to death.
0.0	0.748940851876	And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to.
0.0	0.256122616819	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.144669714676	So was I, John.
0.0	0.361692242024	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.178252195938	I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party's nominee.
0.0	0.260179955646	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.0671445999999	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.894409558646	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.669974806793	At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.
0.0	0.256014422731	You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country.
0.0	0.429639588223	I would change them.
0.0	0.125744120777	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.0887817980161	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.0385215524443	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.417830687738	All of us want equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.437301864544	(APPLAUSE) They're trying to prevent people from registering to vote.
0.0	0.00614999827158	I agree with that.
0.0	0.336067786729	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.154312581239	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?
0.0	0.163705209678	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.2758967116	One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy.
0.0	0.218103888008	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.189846364047	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.123517915562	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.0642498943263	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.00614999827158	I agree with them.
0.0	0.790236933121	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.0853332837246	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.0385215524443	Absolutely.
0.0	0.0464096693605	I didn't.
0.0	0.767302031631	We're spending $80 billion locking people up, disproportionately Latino and African American.
0.0	0.235434069897	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.294203903237	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.668956644109	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.240136496983	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.978973686266	Could we loan you $4 billion"?
0.0	0.185656343198	But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.134838547629	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.253054812722	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.667586892252	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.223307709747	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.136721101211	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.181253187829	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.142314001917	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.519675592337	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.21347965837	They won't accept it.
0.0	0.0967687317918	They're going to build in Mexico.
0.0	0.300862663301	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.233363944568	Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks -- between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance.
0.0	0.202752942477	Yes.
0.0	0.394536458915	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.0813320637398	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.244538347944	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.166841165453	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.
0.0	0.339319656754	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
1.0	0.961578782342	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.148368659382	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.63207761039	I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment.
0.0	0.377562574044	If the United States does not lead, there is not another leader.
0.0	0.365413284701	Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.158388227218	He'll say, "Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico."
0.0	0.236259956087	You learn to create feedback mechanisms.
0.0	0.653307233217	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.381603903471	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
1.0	0.981439011348	Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?
0.0	0.0902360261727	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.288002164122	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.212702655555	That's not the America that I think we should be.
0.0	0.546509239216	And if our middle class makes more money, they spend more money, and our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.343437152951	We got a U.N. Security council vote.
0.0	0.0216959167081	That's for sure.
0.0	0.0584800093357	We listen to you and -- and then we act.
0.0	0.485266535715	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.0164069477791	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.279486375167	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.548066685627	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.56358966283	We should make women third-class citizens, that we should allow children to be sexually assaulted, that they are a danger to modern society.
0.0	0.366584063218	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.182728217219	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.126780043753	I've dealt with them all my life.
0.0	0.1119834438	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.
0.0	0.5	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.0393518707402	Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth.
0.0	0.453523764428	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.286933904073	It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
0.0	0.507352114715	In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, "what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"
0.0	0.0985823032455	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.577588045057	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.488040054682	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.0732290335842	OK?
0.0	0.488650801183	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.517471854988	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.0962646804336	Am I supposed to dislike them?
0.0	0.227969137548	At the end of the day, if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities.
0.0	0.171107770258	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
0.0	0.419562460403	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.0737467549443	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.390550074408	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.0999535393978	And they're wonderful people.
0.0	0.269984895372	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.146895820581	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.
0.0	0.0125138285836	He's very charming.
0.0	0.192215712668	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.286727438096	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.350632261325	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.314592857206	But I have another one, Ford.
0.0	0.46710317401	I am on the committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act.
1.0	0.881439599626	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
0.0	0.163075538987	I don't think anyone has a magical solution.
0.0	0.252056008475	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.0902360261727	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.484611288902	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.343634400898	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.449010998706	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.053046634024	Yeah.
0.0	0.76410571723	I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil.
0.0	0.224453614467	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.
0.0	0.111619008494	It's not working.
0.0	0.228580820221	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.319628692237	In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill, "Well I assume Hillary has told you about this."
0.0	0.167871103707	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.179578656512	By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job.
0.0	0.389112404912	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.171370504992	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.392925061066	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.095247996599	Now I want to go back something.
0.0	0.218790272467	Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.
0.0	0.0345451386172	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.0336113342283	And guess what?
0.0	0.755229830603	I also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down.
0.0	0.251753875383	We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.
0.0	0.144451654452	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.443528367193	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
0.0	0.5	We are a better country than this.
0.0	0.223260322115	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.199063544663	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.465016462048	They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.
0.0	0.760025271242	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.119829300362	He's not arming the Kurds.
0.0	0.166085961714	I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.
0.0	0.237224032641	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.0170313525168	How would we act?
0.0	0.107243254415	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
0.0	0.265838890129	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.

0.0	0.175022099766	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.272062010534	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.

0.0	0.179215777099	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.212786982508	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...

1.0	0.300663342034	Well, John, look, I think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis to leave by 2011, is that an Iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend Iraq.
0.0	0.0852349025043	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.0889775044884	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
1.0	0.990287620325	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
0.0	0.108345140755	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.22867662495	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.204610089756	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.369134518368	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.163676555348	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.787064061716	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.182447262855	So I've said, if the big banks don't play by the rules, I will break them up.
0.0	0.0902163050182	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.360140169058	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.345562406506	You can go to opensecrets.org and check that.
0.0	0.882670645672	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
1.0	0.559069924845	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty, and we're the only country in the world -- virtually the only country that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.347285299342	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0343005176147	He was a great negotiator.
0.0	0.24705521127	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.213709547313	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.247770021966	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.
0.0	0.528247006445	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.0278367789496	I can.
0.0	0.0672055732281	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.697758523511	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.351086605791	Barack Obama wants to change America.
0.0	0.158601533207	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.945229309996	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.181492101726	And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.
0.0	0.0794431010994	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.377144000786	When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up.
0.0	0.262345236507	But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it.
0.0	0.468355773088	Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.
0.0	0.59695986807	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.343307966187	When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.
0.0	0.342595236932	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.159374706673	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.519108908749	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
1.0	0.924085787661	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.0664507180388	Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem.
0.0	0.106754231693	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.561897301673	The administration originally said 10.
0.0	0.791640471576	And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.
0.0	0.104659277451	David, let me give you a little bit of background here.
0.0	0.0212157298346	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.0114461702861	Talk about what?
0.0	0.24374579316	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.375574905162	You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.
0.0	0.273986189741	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.215206035342	Everybody's for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.289282166196	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.171197725521	If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country.
0.0	0.51611367918	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.108877456035	The Turks are being threatened.
0.0	0.127101688117	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.0244078784777	Does my family like me?
0.0	0.335346721814	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.820942682866	Number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own.
0.0	0.214954332654	The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.
0.0	0.888848235888	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.273170878034	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.263649719629	Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country -- we would never build in an ocean.
0.0	0.138343480612	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.424867290615	But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn't cut and run.
0.0	0.477248446557	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.31671408246	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.0590865484441	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.147602026593	I'm running for president, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people.
0.0	0.552876834818	And that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity -- kill people who are unarmed who should not be killed, they must be held accountable.
0.0	0.301491301918	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.0612027693136	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.0963037341649	We're rebuilding many countries.
0.0	0.426303673077	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.835920633372	The number of heroin deaths are growing very, very significantly.
0.0	0.0415468088305	That is an egregious act.
0.0	0.224062213594	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.189082589709	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.148116008731	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.45051051823	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.225390947517	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.274822152285	They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.
0.0	0.390781075635	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
0.0	0.106848350112	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.218417277305	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.202812969351	No.
0.0	0.227018856375	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.112850027986	And you have to really work hard at it.
0.0	0.123390187954	They can't lead us.
0.0	0.846202837525	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.160006487415	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.41891107559	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.426230480878	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.30090958155	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.24211762134	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.0165080182595	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.410728460478	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.318902929176	As Americans, we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet, but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies, to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability.
0.0	0.115648078756	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.136087968212	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.330359979492	They are our first line of defense.
0.0	0.345736113555	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.354228835791	They have no plan now."
0.0	0.180428199504	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.0473311798848	But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.
0.0	0.215211104809	It's making...
0.0	0.341558881305	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.38162307916	He thinks low wages are a good idea.
0.0	0.433553770614	It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.
0.0	0.257787646157	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.202835726767	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.660082728855	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.0869783474047	That is the issue.
0.0	0.0682698545242	This is an emergency.
0.0	0.236896154673	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.121271285734	He was young.
0.0	0.0148999150605	He's very smooth.
0.0	0.197622197051	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.118892168021	Check it out.
0.0	0.164983876419	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.368106644856	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.5	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.440903204158	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.143041399824	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.0732290335842	OK?
0.0	0.226648935714	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.472729756949	Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?
0.0	0.0627407806043	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.173291428554	And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.
0.0	0.360486948543	So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
0.0	0.383390711445	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.27043113275	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.377204113106	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.311071069071	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.264063695037	The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...
0.0	0.122071948977	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.175814683705	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.541607369816	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.6109771587	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.202812969351	But...
0.0	0.434270693715	The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.
0.0	0.287736368092	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.202812969351	2,000?
0.0	0.184593567396	There are no simple solutions.
0.0	0.14559431072	And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.
0.0	0.19155087994	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.258578310062	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.207604905977	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.808507390715	We have artificially low interest rates.
0.0	0.226962810836	We actually took action to do these things and as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families.
0.0	0.336588998335	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.0529002484075	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.634892467844	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.553972365101	I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.0135742225749	Look at my family.
0.0	0.573625053627	I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
0.0	0.172652917346	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.481912005111	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.272858359519	We bailed out Wall Street.

0.0	0.115717945773	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.258688000218	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.433819855301	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.

0.0	0.637154241349	Number one...
0.0	0.216039312086	I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart.
0.0	0.480360705855	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.556577921754	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.142772038493	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.

0.0	0.408129064832	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.14000251555	I've done it.
0.0	0.265164929976	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.

0.0	0.331870804313	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.152841319886	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.391021908824	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.171910645924	Thank you, John.
0.0	0.153878278518	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.223531004866	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.450130170602	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.366033118856	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.00565417480343	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.236414436199	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.

0.0	0.140568827696	Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.
0.0	0.0489643479065	DICKERSON: A question from Kathie Obradovich.
0.0	0.0538776174421	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.372861987036	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.317997613243	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
0.0	0.247965560529	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
1.0	0.952348156852	Our military is a disaster.

0.0	0.195394680547	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.16321441985	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.402184261004	I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department.
0.0	0.145674141538	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.156993374051	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.0781022034908	But not for us.
0.0	0.154390958522	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.418419650133	Well, I'm kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time.
0.0	0.0652954792991	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.255507944677	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.
0.0	0.066273937837	Everybody should.
0.0	0.567353502042	We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.
0.0	0.384843987788	When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war.
0.0	0.128321823408	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.196627551643	So it is difficult.
0.0	0.722298098066	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.280876732723	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.294032681026	It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.0485897556402	Here's the story.
1.0	0.826026546619	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.258887126335	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.0873296897029	Two points.
0.0	0.25226295022	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.723965572011	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.951988489834	Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.
0.0	0.186640939874	Sit down with people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the house, and work on a bill.
0.0	0.344935919321	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.416311226681	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.81857346983	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.486280071739	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.5	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.292885250003	He's weak on immigration.

0.0	0.166394097331	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.169877854189	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.0246573945038	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.161781139481	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.0814853886166	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.355317591224	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.296603959768	The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.
0.0	0.0804467023004	Let me just -- let me just...
0.0	0.0463480040288	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.231683569087	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.560582723627	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.181144280564	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.0647807883638	And that's what I will do as your president.
0.0	0.483561287704	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.

0.0	0.201500253507	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.198900237259	I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States and literally around the world that there is a "clash of civilizations," that there is some kind of Western plot or even "war against Islam," which then I believe fans the flames of radicalization.

0.0	0.360383595807	The list goes on because the differences are so stark.
0.0	0.102509540677	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.189299186191	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.
0.0	0.474700217741	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.105660133687	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.217787482722	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.419036322556	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.256920242514	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.141153152093	They wouldn't be there except for us.
0.0	0.40934427194	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.355640627672	So there's more to my plan than just the cap.
0.0	0.445428324886	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.339927064078	If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
0.0	0.73079474193	So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.
0.0	0.220161461758	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.111581310069	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.333076184899	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.457348150522	Close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole and...
0.0	0.382805250056	ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.
0.0	0.270507449096	Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants.

0.0	0.124930161659	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.285023830044	Number two, we had a really good plan.

0.0	0.0823678430282	Believe me, folks.
0.0	0.0838764324547	... And start taking advice...
0.0	0.0514273890783	Oh, great.
0.0	0.218447930163	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.052508861276	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.109949815817	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.067438547014	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.143703961462	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.738092339881	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
0.0	0.606889495136	I'm using my own money.
0.0	0.185802464737	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.413742660864	Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place.
0.0	0.0680363794959	Chris, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.267529996885	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.
0.0	0.459642635614	First of all...
0.0	0.173468298652	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.0532752284862	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.339284773994	I have a comprehensive, tough plan.
0.0	0.21181872882	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.346039310933	Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
0.0	0.217738857287	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.094200073453	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.529251023828	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.0638769812791	But I can tell you this.
0.0	0.266172334105	Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.
0.0	0.535197427204	But Secretary Clinton is wrong.
0.0	0.868798524831	It's their money.
0.0	0.410612418731	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.123070814937	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.658110488497	I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war.
0.0	0.276411128258	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.532003457828	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.586023303233	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
0.0	0.0604291250205	Thank you, Marco.
0.0	0.13183229108	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.0732290335842	OK.
0.0	0.149460752474	There's too much -- it's like -- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
0.0	0.131546184584	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.204140322085	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.323312731861	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.45667079001	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.0536349409797	I'm proud of my family.
0.0	0.455237913866	This is what's made our nation so special.
0.0	0.918280916692	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.271648850073	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
0.0	0.329913435847	As president, I would make the administrator of USAID an actual cabinet member.
0.0	0.140858093789	I don't think we're at war with all Muslims.
0.0	0.170872306535	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.0305485971871	And you know what?
0.0	0.198133315933	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.
0.0	0.148613437198	Yes, they control them.
0.0	0.0564760096576	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.0810677786026	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.232441795643	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.592356098587	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.279940354545	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.0936712150648	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.418579822162	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.0230121088788	I love China.
0.0	0.219335901852	I think we all support it.
0.0	0.0953805732681	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.608338806319	... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.
0.0	0.367104627221	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.10430972092	You know why three?
0.0	0.332021448976	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.373622125705	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.0950362344475	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.903660956538	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.312296442127	We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy.
0.0	0.06942824406	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.783251433174	Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.
0.0	0.162575286329	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.
0.0	0.279987003512	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.145018358311	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.127116931739	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.848998162544	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.037520509751	Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.
0.0	0.587560433582	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.170772613282	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.025999318049	You know, I like Marco.
0.0	0.901941449732	And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion."
0.0	0.216777785787	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.642391123698	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
1.0	0.522393924454	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.723058965338	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.634373750789	I hire people, they do a Web site.
0.0	0.412856983483	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.

0.0	0.753848965885	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.118243949878	We are doing both at the same time.
0.0	0.265800032557	And she turned around many lives.
0.0	0.520620889034	That means medical.
0.0	0.480433839138	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.185185526111	I promise.
0.0	0.334079190686	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.189846364047	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.526469989127	... people all over this country -- not you, Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other.
0.0	0.372255369423	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.110461264429	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.134298679479	I've been there 35 times.

0.0	0.112974249229	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.
0.0	0.523374784214	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.0268190628229	We need that thinking.
0.0	0.11599609424	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.562763811269	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.335299423091	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
0.0	0.310938315068	... do I go -- let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.256518790515	My wife, Jane, has been -- way back when before I knew her, a foster parent.
0.0	0.177524447687	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.40149057099	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.0685513804826	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.482422900509	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.208300996098	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.161390966958	But Obamacare kicks in in 2016.
0.0	0.385511675488	Neil, I was mentioned too.

0.0	0.204228615412	Thank you, good night and may the force be with you.
0.0	0.534797549659	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.118955620387	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.137765417158	And there is a lot we can do in college affordability.
0.0	0.120741361757	I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.
0.0	0.553754959578	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.0395274868586	Right.
0.0	0.373463153935	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.734978562569	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.464745516332	I was for legalization.
0.0	0.210536610744	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.
0.0	0.207488730361	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.440961875351	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.244095715862	You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
0.0	0.0603067644566	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.419990713279	I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.
0.0	0.547607549915	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.5	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.522218882482	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.65573455354	For example, it is outrageous that we don't have an opportunity for Medicare to negotiate for lower prices.
0.0	0.806912924446	And I applaud his record in Maryland.
0.0	0.0334424473566	Thank you.
0.0	0.237014679307	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.0830988142728	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.417707656041	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.276048280899	I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.641645801372	We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate.
0.0	0.970507216947	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.433419494553	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.0930694271395	It really is important that we go forward on this.
0.0	0.256988868967	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.0322950291077	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.0918001730956	Jared (ph), Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family.
0.0	0.974967556714	But you would index it -- you would index it to the median wage.
0.0	0.155524727345	But you don't hear that from anybody else.
0.0	0.265218007248	A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this.
0.0	0.233483405722	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.343626867859	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.159322606026	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.5	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.171916939832	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.344840715387	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.598264843539	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.053046634024	Yeah.
0.0	0.413582016931	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.125918470379	They don't even have a chance.
1.0	0.772291428857	Nancy, the blueprint in Maryland that we followed was yes, we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment.
0.0	0.0946849024583	I do and this is an important issue and I know we'll get to a lot of other critical ones as well.
0.0	0.583327188232	They don't want to raise the minimum wage, they don't want to do anything to increase incomes.
0.0	0.294697050963	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.14635529836	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.616008195259	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.417635677912	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.34200252111	So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.
0.0	0.440004619988	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.192727559635	Come on now.
0.0	0.232542209359	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.0305485971871	And you know what?
0.0	0.420565088156	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.168485229854	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.0535666585651	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.993664545812	Do the $12 and you would index it.
0.0	0.895221996014	Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.
0.0	0.273934712712	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.585784920664	Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.
0.0	0.285925076567	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.259043903128	But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.261116107263	But actually I am.
0.0	0.455959682577	And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.462730668445	and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States.
0.0	0.368509510209	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.0652446925642	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.0724425004523	But look, we didn't know what was happening next.
0.0	0.342673123791	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.554057184506	Hey, I have lobbyists.
0.0	0.30847080078	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.101412325367	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.130777587684	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.39975022255	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.108473895796	Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
0.0	0.471855004798	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.00229132652517	I'll do it.
0.0	0.360553357833	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.306277425397	We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it.
0.0	0.132629515777	I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.
0.0	0.329811624748	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.456101702197	Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.
0.0	0.979169817526	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.0917689832189	We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.
0.0	0.367112943178	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.215790934476	Your question was you have disagreed...
0.0	0.459168275921	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.798797288466	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.260835135775	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
0.0	0.437927154951	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.0116204412265	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
0.0	0.213734555641	I give a lot of money away to charities and other things.
0.0	0.142167398767	I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie.
0.0	0.143534662083	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.203522143524	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.33663626791	Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability.
0.0	0.0192435810151	We're friends.
0.0	0.290479448966	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.146630940483	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.2696852025	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.387698127564	ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries.
0.0	0.352510292304	We have three children, eight, five and one.
0.0	0.163223427454	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.36866470537	And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe.
0.0	0.216047252747	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.404590580786	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.220938758096	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.221220973785	You can't be in favor of defend us...
0.0	0.363463129207	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.380741893983	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.441100912226	There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction.
0.0	0.198293119092	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.0804467023004	Let me just...
0.0	0.350107190805	I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism --
0.0	0.196966278191	So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.
0.0	0.0171778876607	They're not good.
0.0	0.278461615547	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.0216959167081	Sure.
0.0	0.0902163050182	But let's be clear.
0.0	0.105225658052	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.126012216298	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.56959915042	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.393209880523	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.0383906777639	It's what they call it.
0.0	0.193760504428	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.091364602139	But I think it's the right road for us to try to travel.
0.0	0.230125114206	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.0388773599787	We will be there soon.
0.0	0.274777029207	We cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of moral nations around this Earth, we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats, because Martha, this will not be the last region where nation-states fail.
0.0	0.0413537856195	Excuse me.
0.0	0.256834605717	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.05292962291	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.0939364388715	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.139896656092	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.67489817694	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.441189874399	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.188978807809	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.330140632917	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.284556972083	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.0789815619116	This will end.
0.0	0.456771236263	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.573734007759	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.383671397009	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.0918286073978	And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous.
0.0	0.446070236637	Revolution never came.
0.0	0.182957177728	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.109391990026	That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.
0.0	0.4560539576	And, yes, we are at war with those people.
0.0	0.98077999049	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.309213516881	They like to ask direct questions.
0.0	0.548925852296	We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that's what's keeping him contained.
0.0	0.171687105253	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
1.0	0.898275023629	He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.
0.0	0.242812691708	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.422522320743	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.461572344719	First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.159909129757	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.241110730253	Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.
0.0	0.116958435628	Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."
0.0	0.367495352949	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.184758100611	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.1455534822	There are hundreds of things like that.
0.0	0.241164636532	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.120693298971	... (inaudible) opening statement.
0.0	0.222827555058	He's wrong.
0.0	0.0498264700009	It is a step forward.
0.0	0.23374916847	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.333002071625	Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago.
0.0	0.0989427954178	I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.
0.0	0.242267848452	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.0173946198079	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.0975101485426	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.837686640379	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.
0.0	0.280287817589	We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America.
0.0	0.602845553704	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.127282701495	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.0618731671627	They are not our friend, believe me.
0.0	0.177443215211	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.110461264429	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.183337666904	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.
0.0	0.181121114247	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.262707024452	It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.
0.0	0.0254270228763	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.303197118729	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.226001285398	There are a lot of factors involved in that.
0.0	0.210973396932	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.132528742777	He is a good man.
0.0	0.0792506789508	You're not interested in an answer.
1.0	0.464907036761	And the overall message is that it doesn't result in job loss.
0.0	0.5	So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.
