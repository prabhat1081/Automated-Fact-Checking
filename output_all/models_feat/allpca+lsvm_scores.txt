0.0	0.455465565822	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.530746691574	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.514389047605	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.534117020621	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.427198355624	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.366483341451	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.336765402458	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.372280247182	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.471058267663	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.359167491064	You're right.
0.0	0.398949501394	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.512511363706	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
1.0	0.601496641289	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.3277228327	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.376100237658	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.382758227454	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.512869349396	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.523129046802	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.561160161263	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.429205420001	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.559816376547	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.483288209248	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.356997881781	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.451781355479	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.434333584005	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.596267852871	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
1.0	0.522673251081	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.594013231446	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.386262447048	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.592492601953	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.38189359421	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.486977533339	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.327181290596	That's fine.
0.0	0.526978111044	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.43514433596	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.512096911166	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.592619689277	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.492069782779	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.357124700214	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.566065147314	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.41008278183	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.521137977745	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
1.0	0.342369961074	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.624039584074	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.529633507761	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.410165024915	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.330700069877	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.443614443515	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.511248581224	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.441020338215	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.536112014971	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.285999052301	Alright.
0.0	0.425816311671	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.472302847001	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.479121479723	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.610509751334	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.370907288275	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.294484787098	Let me be clear.
1.0	0.584546246698	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.420932445973	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.386145436767	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.39557027715	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.553641075135	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.427260722439	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.515040525225	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.367979890026	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.412381154423	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.526428548746	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.516477681744	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.354983266934	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.431048732549	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.338066252467	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.406770850995	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.395688217265	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.378705691533	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.528468251372	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.454500122336	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.466450655697	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.601719510425	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.344385449057	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.467058840384	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.286892330109	Illegal.
0.0	0.563485476752	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.441913509555	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.351025734003	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.338060469335	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.528332665283	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
1.0	0.638172768152	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.507560443673	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.559158191187	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.505399623956	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.620085762891	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.283875394101	Okay.
0.0	0.491620311397	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.435077045105	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.319921686069	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.53340558118	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.454204958344	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.348299239627	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.477675117007	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.557515493654	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.346984967719	That's my view.
0.0	0.583833971313	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.330742768005	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.630027430576	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.432948051021	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.56412280795	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.494887388939	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.502387134702	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.324533806536	You know why?
0.0	0.528697150125	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.585292084057	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.56483938294	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.534715491746	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.581290287586	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.401688882849	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.580023139298	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.54116336045	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.489736090947	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.344419567314	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.430495653417	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
1.0	0.535416352586	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.40976805195	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.608439290544	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
1.0	0.342906000199	Very few children.
0.0	0.396816232774	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.42143314024	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.30720743943	Say again?
0.0	0.436399935556	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.568567978149	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.436905957199	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.628235575014	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
1.0	0.563271295539	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.597909967741	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.498034053571	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.41616634434	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.563979721182	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.349585770756	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.486187535694	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.316413538022	No, John.
0.0	0.594708860006	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.505555539076	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
1.0	0.565648883734	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.392828993183	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.502061277051	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.547540701206	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.575733397811	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.550382702112	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.541978609953	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.401279558052	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.476242096867	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.527284024762	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.526225259528	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.518029296845	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.552075726663	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.482670429416	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
1.0	0.558156172517	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.374543646473	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.492749873715	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.447926167467	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.529338943775	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
1.0	0.622528854906	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.474510504321	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.475884335794	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.462393901123	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.492255226961	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.332979507739	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.507485498118	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.525196558157	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.345071006331	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.514677596428	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.551120976251	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.348439753001	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.436058144089	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.620535194803	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.479918346183	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
1.0	0.529316724039	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.339871847169	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.552833427824	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.447404007338	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.632588938314	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.516823837964	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.459188767876	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.486073823118	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.528483239819	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.362728244054	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.416239130419	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.350930035536	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.613796476168	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.442329699739	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.461398781972	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.458649699499	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.325503929314	You can have him.
0.0	0.368222956653	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.513002483789	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.441051047121	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.523627739942	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.455440332605	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.287665232421	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.608362578143	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.483066509934	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.377903216885	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.309863043282	That is important.
0.0	0.339623228197	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.453239231012	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.457293999277	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.547094637921	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.554923620241	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.296305550479	...John...
0.0	0.388211348198	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.443210692868	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.516351744662	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.33412697304	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.547255039075	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.608457042325	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.534546291567	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.51283130689	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.509875091905	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.32883253202	They were wrong.
0.0	0.475945854499	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.529168066964	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.513405573876	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.479423392177	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.662065436508	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.408393237028	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.562861317178	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.390610023374	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.530387531176	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.530234098804	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.547330689208	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.443993882411	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.48808170729	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.497730835964	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.291522058914	John?
0.0	0.310049874151	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.536683143083	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.520009985548	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.385686036556	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.505968401904	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.41543073504	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.326231972383	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.432954420912	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.357315246597	That's my bill.
0.0	0.527072677768	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.306965433062	I have...
0.0	0.409390237211	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.28569936609	Yes.
0.0	0.394611347197	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.586653742998	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.531647016145	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.480109731644	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.490732445324	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.534873639935	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.346848686921	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.50166154336	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.462964366863	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.395950401784	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.493661222791	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.519587525288	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.49129437989	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.481230190923	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.362361199828	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.476504911276	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.354270989571	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.458501628764	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.530583339336	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.62041796334	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.537488875743	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.534513775044	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.370820482397	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.460603779496	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.593549074999	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.50269027479	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.436243824679	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.483159535629	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.441509957721	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.307285082412	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.427836717341	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.338875232971	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.381298735532	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.335858558026	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.678673202893	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.583864097115	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.484519887111	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.424730157834	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.44421582225	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.322251583744	That's not true.
0.0	0.377754787819	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.531406260048	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.460237974944	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.354414336848	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.464599785109	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.32086691762	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.448969812035	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
1.0	0.525141298784	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.326429301675	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.482645677998	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.443212694077	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.463199545005	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.590343334633	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.35725843219	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.455160396702	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.382802072907	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.621659415107	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.469062557979	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.433910794155	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.484175765067	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.312863920994	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.533050172586	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.497562561481	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.385632457201	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.54955563797	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.582883296907	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.43970545911	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.525881863875	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.386221834998	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.597950579929	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
1.0	0.522738658634	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.454364966346	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.472697953852	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.323912651502	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.547724135059	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.543060037568	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.621198881978	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.574240148416	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.364176684269	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.393081035467	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.526531063677	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.500273166713	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.550958540237	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.329346252934	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.510255127172	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.330761258375	We need sound money.
0.0	0.676198831931	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.564590733012	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.490336724814	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.349027923858	But I would add this.
0.0	0.349970267932	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.397349694611	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.581158957742	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.578162653662	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.455017988805	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.38886195424	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.374356780831	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.538833291096	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.517481791472	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.333018931552	We are not France.
0.0	0.333885930273	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.525406941824	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.523341487533	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.426253049205	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.501592468776	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.378215613746	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.534479617386	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.394747436319	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.323191350887	But you know what?
0.0	0.521059229834	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.546787274676	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.570004955072	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.525619679727	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.528778415819	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.533037220778	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.484774184656	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.435141205204	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.514221246876	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.374733074885	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.350819126728	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.647421027306	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.431452148636	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.415432486091	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.3252319548	We don't win.
0.0	0.510431403089	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.599742366325	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.349935872579	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.413733448034	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.473060953028	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.431203064958	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.399598151491	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.546657504915	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.533600842323	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.537503133181	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.546029135116	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.531321986449	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.563695570711	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.617236756211	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.514226958358	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.319650559789	Think about it.
0.0	0.355179933879	This country is changing.
0.0	0.548445637653	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.410755138064	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.45450411903	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
1.0	0.338116881932	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.338575110475	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.316250865961	I think you're --
0.0	0.35347982007	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.489928170409	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.485129090987	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.383764161766	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.558791128577	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.407564025548	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.331567874481	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.318538618782	We do.
0.0	0.285382683998	OK?
0.0	0.464621061341	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.528634913312	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.386173678449	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.365586412806	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.490792493505	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.321372350816	I like that.
0.0	0.486643780059	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.394419912388	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.375496450467	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.477563866835	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.555617027838	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.505875503209	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.311594211305	I win.
0.0	0.57478455597	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.371817703644	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.352122440221	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.489995006622	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.471587448844	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.552428015028	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.582505668841	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.624824382126	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.364618267069	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.425138684226	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
1.0	0.522660038815	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.437538658556	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.547546375471	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.338236239658	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.596513344014	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.477548397	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.474044926017	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.480709019425	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.414432607289	And here's what the economic issue is.
1.0	0.625690320628	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
1.0	0.609714688657	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.360876858709	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.578974018029	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.470852032257	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.584400362393	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.385715633583	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.491346666323	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.345258918977	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.545553142872	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.50533695244	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.497661564293	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
1.0	0.563038949761	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.45069858951	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.419596638956	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.521430249911	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.485287768196	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.599951574699	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.633258652358	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.300028542494	Absolutely.
0.0	0.329075714808	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.405094602523	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.366260161937	No, you did.
0.0	0.378141642279	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.347354129653	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.41601047434	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.384490040622	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.365530035292	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.517597674753	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.439376317473	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.601006425556	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.60825558497	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.577103406184	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.477078606253	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.353799462322	It's their money.
0.0	0.563552170398	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.54513180436	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.495944542296	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.428467756311	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.420987337752	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.50227255166	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.486945124175	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.453285263642	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.368395199825	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.474474453924	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.57991516788	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.329712786625	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.429513558159	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.430218541382	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.473549614646	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.446667899353	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.58555527171	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.378763816951	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.436140121112	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.445893415342	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.502840407933	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.519288750078	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.481791487206	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.324527737511	That's the difference.
0.0	0.454603767467	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.524943725358	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.437839629306	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.454068184392	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.587208663448	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.495394066501	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.505141129224	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.309493072324	...income tax...
0.0	0.522969044287	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.566271364646	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.470839534465	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.449217862003	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.523882488611	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.483202466255	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.497727189108	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
1.0	0.637255789361	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.440712784437	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.54566032646	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.388982311066	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.621083736404	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.402392264551	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.488959363691	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.495059456223	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.403280640788	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.517120117587	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.481580733883	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.544075409402	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.576246997308	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.335753772957	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.600854100439	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.533730948272	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.44433709838	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.555116648685	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.477051510909	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.442440905091	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.351335864383	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.529061915487	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.573779788221	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.325691202294	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.439961048312	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.533106449273	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.429743004163	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.529703801625	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.328182901133	No, no.
0.0	0.556383416136	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.512322699071	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.55907439709	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.472496728573	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.578464784635	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.443410386222	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.384922648858	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.446113523665	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.489451282733	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
1.0	0.522541389663	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.441861676385	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.317787402038	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.411455413517	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.492069782779	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.544899009055	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.536377853529	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.474362118319	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.546262005533	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.502724137594	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.555595549425	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
1.0	0.534518292468	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.388809152086	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.477014142351	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.334781702427	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.51422607096	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.530618770344	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.334565313035	Why is that?
0.0	0.608876950532	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.592878820566	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.502383198848	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.505099072392	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.380225533921	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.426239516785	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.347831667508	We actually did it.
0.0	0.520845809031	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.327691085	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.384711045648	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.46760424723	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.437233436031	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.480093492244	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.543882791195	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.348622741896	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.455228880748	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.431627140199	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.562328236092	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.46888079236	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.506359293957	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.562890028157	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.490669254234	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.432877939309	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.

0.0	0.455858153409	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.582871301574	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.527217471687	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.371641874893	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.

0.0	0.293591460872	So...
0.0	0.369964880108	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.324217119008	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.406616069541	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.478052862909	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.53894842624	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.527246620513	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.446189322224	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.470062708972	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.347924888199	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.519757075745	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
1.0	0.490571637687	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.568239173473	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.478199210195	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.532405436401	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.534279893522	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.535583601387	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.526049974358	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.463924028645	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.5410071012	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.556213667966	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.4161204784	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.504453846302	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.456146889247	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.323191350887	And you know what?
0.0	0.505156041922	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.588436773918	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.540334070716	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.384719470496	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.408311599655	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.

0.0	0.501158379238	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.37309453404	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.519295142217	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.536127473342	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.527336122908	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.547489473085	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.4520771788	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.525000077083	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.

0.0	0.425302085066	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.501166433266	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.530001402048	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.52400003181	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.573572500131	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.521512247902	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.553983181036	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
1.0	0.477085860026	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.445513918956	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.43434642657	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.585998738671	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.426767447742	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.532787385496	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.310593045016	I want security.

0.0	0.457141323489	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.576271555712	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.525865565314	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.364247466538	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.337154403826	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.340711615336	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.438250551601	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.329103088105	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.346699818015	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.527398151268	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
1.0	0.638265006885	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.

0.0	0.492097786011	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.511635892395	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.546755321456	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.37887464204	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.480419323209	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.491818957864	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.542946694986	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.554840973261	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.286185814918	Neil...

0.0	0.527002459415	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.348600566945	I think he is right.
0.0	0.377718399301	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.351205765883	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.544280059094	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.528736018293	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.568145540068	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.477649806581	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.519490866453	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.36170273638	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.509306609373	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.333488977223	You have to lead.
0.0	0.333183101827	We're running.
0.0	0.581587189478	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.542901055098	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.553478642648	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.472504264605	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.472065238401	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.

0.0	0.390986299732	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.435739988869	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.56648754279	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.503543095453	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.493489294713	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.488647181001	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.525525191012	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.435306902065	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.437472645755	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.339355084837	Maria, I'd just like to say...

0.0	0.484684857521	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.484287613014	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.43330768919	... of $50 billion...

0.0	0.394683862656	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.503577527395	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.339263344542	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.512027572154	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.299321153307	Right.
0.0	0.391028144241	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.574195004852	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.434644843335	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.509478801097	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.470344922366	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
1.0	0.561174319087	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.432848921622	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.472733313258	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.492853445634	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.531321568112	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.485587806441	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.519751485884	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.410263191631	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.428031416101	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.467075122778	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.467028836769	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.397810236792	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.315049272052	He's wrong.
0.0	0.549718766454	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.498297330006	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.520693584037	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.552012265036	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.505556966183	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.611328722381	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.349951825888	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.538451294022	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.500279676745	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.51443845436	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.522511354479	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.551292549047	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.389503677933	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.607568565975	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.592162858807	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.534784686482	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.608630219359	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.472944375513	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.503656008121	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.568976593282	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.580200193461	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.476197695177	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.499985781573	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.477948045068	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.315264230621	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.542189011093	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.49291613838	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.501742852333	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.481402273882	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.486391032535	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.485959036709	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.513015761178	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.379566734025	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.508542751943	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.515883161889	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.384276372412	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.349350403298	Look, here is the reality, folks.
1.0	0.390573969412	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.535187343346	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.531622450441	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.383595216673	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.328471839444	How great is that?
0.0	0.666666666667	Of course not.
0.0	0.540754482981	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.413101817797	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.428850473546	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.408448174845	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.569038710446	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.53057722587	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.501395975169	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.4486577717	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.523955760417	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.342419190801	They're a scam.
0.0	0.464051302588	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.407389880181	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.488549958389	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.505674829696	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.52451371553	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
1.0	0.516342355091	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.436930830697	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.410963689882	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.52490254017	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.571237707977	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.320191938011	(inaudible).
0.0	0.521489446071	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.5940791866	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.528788208893	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.426638651009	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.526412162971	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.621667781207	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.350489668587	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.401514564195	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.376784075986	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.491209478849	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.405382666997	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.36946997626	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.499904028907	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.306617132826	And so do I.
0.0	0.571620722177	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.399503873721	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.605416930691	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.497614136056	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.0	And...
0.0	0.426502892027	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.418426095271	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.484481192378	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.385765329282	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.356310829835	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.51697854358	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.460741764353	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.494354816482	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.471956900907	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.528269754909	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.420388066788	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.308669402049	That's good.
0.0	0.364996890125	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.462313300233	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.360860500829	I never said that.
0.0	0.466663375909	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.478531844862	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.40689191739	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.52774151947	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.393949326096	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.479209744754	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.550303373526	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.639622547006	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.378184420091	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.397353824898	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.464636044377	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.463622835297	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.406282341607	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.480859127053	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.513673299527	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.539349370752	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.351176202134	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.430393463309	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.338430188999	That will change everything.
0.0	0.63032648575	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.68362420643	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.509433959543	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.540400623278	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.407173945747	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.543160830756	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.347569606027	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.527057711845	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.613094433103	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.411334840483	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.628418818604	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.493913422384	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.607909045728	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.529958701181	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.553617029973	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.481920031868	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.603449388584	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.579685377278	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.438844667356	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.648335280078	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.546189847559	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.410743530951	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.375463904344	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.357787642339	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.583287828068	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.484905877713	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.337796201294	How about this?
0.0	0.383017539654	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.561168522324	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.415065894636	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.451799594389	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.502739433822	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.384771822166	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.52581576716	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.341453920755	Two points.
0.0	0.50074545288	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.327933083342	I can do that.
0.0	0.467560974374	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.472914264937	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.558712001419	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.403794413495	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.457854397574	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.32518010256	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.528507197508	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.598728340409	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.652200471068	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.373557221279	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.39650872983	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.428366861843	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.519411843842	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.597699757067	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.363314198422	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.402639535081	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.533675370978	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.283481369802	Becky --
0.0	0.473016891862	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.487145212728	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.523974726553	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.372968675125	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.454336756029	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.607271504891	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.494954757035	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.363396479518	They were paid speeches.

0.0	0.502032693055	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.

0.0	0.534740660589	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.596757013506	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.3782005059	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.544079930073	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.565985867008	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.370001832339	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.433311744571	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.566868596553	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.589655125958	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
1.0	0.344277338804	They were wrong.
0.0	0.461559496655	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.323191350887	And you know what?
0.0	0.458648492322	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.589547941279	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.49929497287	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.415640822677	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.397511877718	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.391302596064	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.491753011452	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.337812096034	So you might not.
0.0	0.499761731326	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.552547937774	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.549007208806	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
1.0	0.579239888247	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.432591710809	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.38380269257	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.464911496149	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.432558176739	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.338456676006	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.492186781087	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.42091758038	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.493162422059	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.417034303302	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.472624988342	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.487137312476	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.577236439795	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.287665232421	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.435229530139	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.419078568488	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.430397884924	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.427003146074	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.391240102969	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.535533002356	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.574723277662	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.556016406742	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.559116341133	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.420699526084	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.460431605145	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.277432349297	...No, sir...
0.0	0.425479995621	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.346821243266	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.375620320745	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.48433532279	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.425376273034	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.41325960266	We need to reform Social Security.
1.0	0.546531932902	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.542401901143	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.319944496481	He does great.
0.0	0.420564766646	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.511875112548	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.375725454091	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.485071454093	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.512319980922	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.464793697074	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.569280277428	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
1.0	0.524074030614	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.508049004012	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.363821619539	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.554610826319	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.337902064838	I said no.
0.0	0.531494039643	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.553690587707	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
1.0	0.498283552842	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.0	But...
0.0	0.538074673549	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.562301872713	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.381388822252	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.450894925078	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.385450294	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.572838419006	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.401197613971	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.648596682342	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.427705324808	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.483794100963	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.360119547749	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.498100174531	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.475472177348	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.540707140744	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.526016070675	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
1.0	0.650925728707	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.440775556007	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.541787701606	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.59499245536	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.0	Yeah.
0.0	0.496988497199	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.37151796496	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.626050716908	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.514209683167	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.512859539459	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.532726495455	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.434007448871	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.401712353751	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.450096804628	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.375619052934	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.321686018899	Think about that.
0.0	0.674169467371	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.508613904688	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.573663456987	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.456830960923	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.534948821619	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.528933633056	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.394167012601	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.317401523026	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.337811486952	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.521586839277	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.47478445771	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.601376395218	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.570855287552	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.544109477075	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.560485179767	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.409900715244	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.3294571526	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.346179125347	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.520182146418	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.481384241933	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.475532249255	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.506989638726	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.546937556348	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.516502959613	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.377919821133	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.507471761964	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.521993690872	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.592527392945	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.362836604113	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.345842805096	My background is different.
0.0	0.504198834355	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.339191906428	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.624336307488	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.465152887711	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.58792697295	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.28569936609	Yes.
0.0	0.514934507655	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.363195513342	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.466000775128	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.591282638464	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.579283375794	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.536581264599	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.471159620318	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.445506831445	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.518903417948	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.404376717202	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.372982915276	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.513918989098	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.56957871016	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.504384031206	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.509234305014	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.572184852501	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.548953167594	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.392794682922	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.448929021677	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.536582039001	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.285382683998	OK.
0.0	0.533811182736	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.455054262597	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.555273366467	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.344967817194	You know why three?
0.0	0.395435083196	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.469805286694	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.523849992884	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.55368112725	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.595467556593	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.472164318776	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.56412890949	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.495524704175	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.558574971461	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.394640714788	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
1.0	0.350080324466	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.537637442606	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.323191350887	And you know what?
0.0	0.478749219302	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.549453169686	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.441429115298	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.517996134954	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.55740724586	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.414463019898	Well, a couple of things.
1.0	0.549873075785	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.321977982313	I don't care.
0.0	0.392841253602	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.398797570203	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.440056474371	So we have a good group of people.
1.0	0.570963759642	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.371534215569	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.566640097485	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.484132773072	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.373801365338	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.455863838029	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.328098111901	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.465163864108	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.397086602799	It's not supposed to happen that way.

0.0	0.539145195676	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.477724740483	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.

0.0	0.424152900151	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.409617201493	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.398382007836	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.417916804062	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.530641915887	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.386451973569	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.534037587827	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.411178883683	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.540338572763	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.556086043933	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.534199726082	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.451328769068	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.516656947002	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.384490481971	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.410544795632	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.574056718139	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.392252497167	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.468893125468	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.546957214794	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.36464907311	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.565800236663	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.535639248942	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.552177238123	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.512657454249	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.475173553843	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.317447418115	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.514086033659	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.543102520171	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.484474837885	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.551145771229	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
1.0	0.491169555275	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.479005621092	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.512374600012	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.398850413476	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.671945119592	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.534434656938	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.443588861512	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.585230503427	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.401822628548	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.582343925704	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.526231999854	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.418677643578	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.513858115558	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.562911065627	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.599882550849	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.49456424555	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.421819737466	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.435439971088	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.528295773205	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.51661899185	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.35709172973	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.475321361482	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.295762037449	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.493522344721	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.349165047222	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.433206864372	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.514483976362	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.317272387217	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.484235849277	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.510797029346	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.66517262385	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.628505806967	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.511548385873	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
1.0	0.481038024053	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.48347447026	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.539268696762	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.520086429097	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.542101791171	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.589516046658	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.483819178365	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.300028542494	Absolutely.
0.0	0.562522519117	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.40093549369	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.551101177639	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.471474985839	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.507936931752	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.509119428176	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.541073084304	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.321257602712	And why?
0.0	0.311143530594	Can we stop?
0.0	0.551472638514	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.480179584163	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.381800309598	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.494243971288	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.51312012886	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.496646383813	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.420157447047	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.387001730962	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.346918557898	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.301411797406	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.461052283132	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.505761512229	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.421814624117	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.496297041976	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
1.0	0.382984546085	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.493393595096	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.517317321758	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.656088600287	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.388112055905	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.51612494124	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.316800902246	It feels different.
0.0	0.500894127612	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.378763816951	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.46314678048	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.479504649231	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.58822369102	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.442610222634	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.345937826229	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.367371199203	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.538034763335	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.509548748561	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.486983072732	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.445392681557	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.47647788791	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.574509702194	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.333437891384	We're running.
0.0	0.500407940535	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.534244099413	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.371227061529	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.396583726642	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.401812581706	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.524155451527	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
1.0	0.475002272606	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.577523396871	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.507210432886	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.337989024945	You count on it.
0.0	0.360860500829	I never said that.
0.0	0.544355707948	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.524692802725	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.457756569454	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.557708925942	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.451652754572	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.546642394831	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.353091797561	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.356553362352	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.510978657869	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.38293181084	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.483159230644	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.337997458315	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.380287025517	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.373951301533	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.0	Yeah.
0.0	0.364020984517	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.612982018214	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.392317822679	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.478408531939	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.507716405367	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.586358772985	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.547106723816	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.465762623921	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.334955036323	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.33928426527	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.47644083275	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.510381782707	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.592208357734	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.352785031409	I've done it.
0.0	0.437585486726	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
1.0	0.320388070305	That's wrong.
0.0	0.508939368193	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.430807870844	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.453231351329	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.336527969768	...before I go.
0.0	0.57030527813	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.573786741667	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.408849313229	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
1.0	0.563149767672	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.373426132703	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.433141106619	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.589237302375	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.386192711256	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.433848119461	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.54539563357	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.450232197769	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.453103302806	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.488037549965	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.529634825825	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.525377554529	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.30629319884	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.559768803165	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.442939756123	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.492059504402	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.553788174609	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.375488318394	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.379564244701	That's what I said.
0.0	0.403978308282	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.437757325699	Neil, my name was mentioned here.

0.0	0.468118267975	Good luck making something out of this mess."

0.0	0.42712830326	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.524021335736	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.355203593228	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.374306068831	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.

0.0	0.49159016187	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.431507386699	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.454225523818	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.511423401628	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.

0.0	0.508745933073	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.352476053942	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.

0.0	0.379080171054	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.413369854497	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.51401068652	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.467196928273	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.366354826232	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.386421264558	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.522614336611	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.396346356184	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.318538618782	You do.
0.0	0.545867288333	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.370072673133	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.360636791863	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.509866144812	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.533057933381	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.

0.0	0.432223286976	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.468282887463	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.342123728466	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.4385886794	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.357351106656	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.43784774036	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.575759867807	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.491989896673	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.506182153576	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.380387859724	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.313984910323	I would change them.
0.0	0.481202967955	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.532959161476	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.542608480694	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.450065512498	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.

0.0	0.471779455171	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.

0.0	0.372578120845	She voted for it.

0.0	0.599755935327	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.48701068268	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.551630557917	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.578072086436	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.

0.0	0.340719637394	So you know what?
0.0	0.52439888754	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.513698503854	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.35952507141	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.45374751435	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.383817322523	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.476079083271	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.63027574012	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.424569826521	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.654107141579	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.523072505081	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.475354490718	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.576601761039	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.428437169919	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.352320218398	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.441763028929	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.528294878809	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.644232073654	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.490813103099	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.574478055265	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.360686046741	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.471073771075	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
1.0	0.533579485452	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.553035689879	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.365604668057	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.439400559515	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.429084090484	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.356880431997	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.471289846183	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
1.0	0.618133921598	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.504425774138	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.497501409894	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.57277395642	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.427223493805	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.32072379089	I think if it doesn't...
1.0	0.483409522648	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
1.0	0.496184079612	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.480431034686	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.564968333721	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.348911512937	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.322150011096	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.587092081115	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.343972555866	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.410332606627	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.453827189817	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
1.0	0.560487959892	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.319618622911	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.383922663243	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.537861105296	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.502437673649	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.349395684419	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.450055144325	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.435190197215	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.426975103951	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.483227122144	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.577071497552	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.564389599016	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.585141291258	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.307483752219	That is...
0.0	0.485423153747	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.347750398142	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.578540351858	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.507818997443	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.502792600999	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.470502862187	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.524099301361	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.458752185244	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.565940505763	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.471563640218	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.564372716261	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.400178040217	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.517568247771	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.544560018962	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.559265231523	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.36561817191	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.403299713072	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.420803370203	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.627818773079	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.547408578485	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.383747428759	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.587276880845	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.320975955574	I like it.
0.0	0.377839254078	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.509574483064	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.336285400577	It's not working.
0.0	0.35150598326	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.393385849988	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.559051652845	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.4703260918	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.60266030332	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.348554207261	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.374728125469	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.470634778666	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.317735079519	Came out great.
0.0	0.539256797352	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.334129895554	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.408146671843	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.5206894944	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.438099862259	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.30729282371	I can.
0.0	0.422040904032	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.531490091041	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.511176043453	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.407351032751	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.286768892491	These...
0.0	0.514839857455	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.545526179252	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
1.0	0.61421533377	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
1.0	0.675339643439	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.536651099145	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.583103159755	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.332895852234	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.480945553499	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.430053633035	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.498280687707	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.489700762242	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.358870440923	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.48742201168	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.325521323704	He undermines it.
0.0	0.308790616556	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.444935669031	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.449235257449	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.653979900337	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.342928580917	And, folks, we will.

0.0	0.349693292247	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.463687315662	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.431422224918	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.351930090694	You looking at me?
0.0	0.525285016818	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.526761476053	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.348716203812	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.433490472871	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...

0.0	0.608682259905	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
1.0	0.468535345809	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.360811292574	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.426533006801	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.324662143765	I hope you'll reconsider.

0.0	0.509526321585	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.303093624702	Why?
0.0	0.481664813297	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.644097058177	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.422178826267	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
1.0	0.557526175734	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.423667123318	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.321752887794	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.47592776839	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.489700617798	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.553450034222	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.303109918594	But look...
0.0	0.521974475688	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.515573126241	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.453133205252	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.532541078535	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.358225014956	We'll just clean it up.

0.0	0.45832760913	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.514779456704	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.494583888319	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.369929406587	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.350087412978	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.477155742489	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.409319731806	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.599011179003	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.429396208228	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.654286292087	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.537967743979	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.356988104408	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.480916986851	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.606100601645	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.650257493754	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.533254832318	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.577860136492	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.326296178619	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.521564394503	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.422862654941	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.636324135159	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.542699190697	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.34222530986	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.525348060468	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.361635475216	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.37905423379	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.598677200029	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.514783713841	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.515122578323	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.446806751915	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
1.0	0.433067164104	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.349322499678	And here's why.
0.0	0.429816685965	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.544198522842	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.587976740347	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.462004843549	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.41045737897	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.547985003621	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.467416416531	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.451752908621	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.524382367314	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.296708736544	...Chris...
0.0	0.517878232233	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.551266617489	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.47440924355	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.396028175425	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.596430351309	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.439974535609	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.480185475344	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.48055070163	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
1.0	0.510621499735	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.441124699182	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.500257639657	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.43736901909	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.66517262385	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.337239199756	I would just say that...
0.0	0.527298403711	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.526927974982	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.550135234586	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.393315929069	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.466941214439	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.550206013444	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.533305653148	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.532429115458	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.481175653812	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.385200167469	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.484312684451	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
1.0	0.630815315033	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.473647825068	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.342552989687	We have no borders.
0.0	0.327540324914	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.523677941815	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.489291882924	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.346488714069	This is 2016.
0.0	0.382419185638	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.330768324414	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.542374213492	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.50209643999	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.404791798095	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.339522535567	I'm tested.
0.0	0.482461594494	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.419352085989	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.511578852006	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.518757387507	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.45130969684	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.636072549609	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.337295019253	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.431615018453	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.328029910091	You bet they do.
0.0	0.508888151875	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.472029104951	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.35809432392	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.646308408534	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.523907286952	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.453484420578	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.704700083465	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.530971766718	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.401239983948	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.613672367346	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.533206145904	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.527079844417	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.399682252591	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.377890546423	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.525081150592	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.341403628649	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.326369028157	That is not right.
0.0	0.380779365351	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.592358773865	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.0	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.458438767618	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.28569936609	Yes.
0.0	0.399351102465	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.361396861007	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.544942735179	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.437222572186	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.53872172683	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.333381153684	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.624795999328	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.342941711648	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.407722345139	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.291690235336	See?
0.0	0.331317327072	That never works.
0.0	0.544942189642	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.327798652226	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.373709947494	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.413824297939	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.482293360401	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.472497149592	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.340818118027	My point is this.
0.0	0.374824206349	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.44465578201	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.397924122292	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.333060606257	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.568435749622	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.363353122809	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.610584307587	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.495442640632	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.443624311244	We have to stop the money flow.

0.0	0.415216758715	You know, let me say something at the outset.
1.0	0.518333091009	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.505913587176	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.56486316481	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.517890586868	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.350960084712	The number of women --
0.0	0.513196935753	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.372159460061	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.521563423248	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.511423221214	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.345460648524	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.486989408241	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.558565206494	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.452552786165	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.443089002745	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.461964536423	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.376801418415	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.495906186364	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.583379020583	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.554502439953	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.449231472304	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.479123525455	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.376467456315	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.329202119411	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.540243192902	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.379939116362	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.545895823114	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.410586331635	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.330440292315	I've laid out...
0.0	0.636521442895	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.456368855918	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.520166352687	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.366289251801	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.56927733138	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.610485474121	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.426097478813	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.543734876677	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.453120483273	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.584456884082	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.33891035367	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.606094791255	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.387246065082	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.551602522047	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.39759113905	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.538429742002	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.526214041984	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.360049802703	I'm not fighting that.

0.0	0.385380565557	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.633072013994	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.394911549147	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.464908305252	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.4390693753	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.553780445957	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.411851850445	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.550310249726	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.430772130802	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.416648031476	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.55357501434	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.523806740373	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.298485905582	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.528460473711	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.314370466477	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.368046546391	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.429083754426	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.52713523516	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.560030037632	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.570644805111	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.464451867552	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.580116369031	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.49238366367	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.561938558511	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.507765951445	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.622017567251	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.553589846872	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.520189355408	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.382602307959	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
1.0	0.629628577287	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.429244386002	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.453405558886	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.333834738675	What should we do?
0.0	0.443294412193	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.334619979771	Good at email.
0.0	0.541745421355	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.480998259977	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.344991186649	I can't do it.
0.0	0.537984698965	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
1.0	0.465157765907	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.365639952522	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.367712204167	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.559551392013	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.377543629701	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.464576869448	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.543300725415	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
1.0	0.581247342572	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.397118897044	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.436498824065	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.459169990793	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.451295038126	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.549346137767	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.427527929313	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.414011946372	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.366815389991	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.430527919363	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.536324259118	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.619776194166	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.360983984308	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.536057946013	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.301120664344	Dynamically.
0.0	0.502568353623	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
1.0	0.433739543701	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.445904067466	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.488414921915	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.547358239328	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.485377652102	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.30967683782	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.565096664303	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.345840219666	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.408314644411	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.532219990553	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.539378397056	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.569605323349	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.551393999167	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.355827522733	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.502494994846	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.464455016452	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.519292617072	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.539146621319	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.287665232421	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.525780643571	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.477577041716	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.534176161288	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.408019187642	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.555924100719	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.425357053957	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.509539852294	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.567959886404	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.469335882307	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.397883380419	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.531035141609	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.479660434158	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.431029625229	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.380011969887	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.425431542919	I was not at all.
0.0	0.30220596127	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.394949973921	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.344545484143	I know every one.
0.0	0.493273244013	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.571173272801	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.556531945886	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.526967151923	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.411221342413	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.515452265969	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.540871731392	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.583276208957	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.586409162687	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.462445843024	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.529669089795	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.483755304963	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.586394082252	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.3082154124	HEMMER: Wow.

0.0	0.340291582296	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.541676186708	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.31865850034	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.316149171602	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.385229257149	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.444126906808	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.462097783738	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.408617200054	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.464266961415	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.52592797485	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.500973912721	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.383420136746	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.343999945727	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.530182193819	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.383019103792	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.457531195518	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.492736524979	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.473549614646	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.485512704575	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.596048547504	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.530113600569	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.403984621613	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.513445068369	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.437046175442	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
1.0	0.574177277617	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.393418723923	With all the candidates, why me?
1.0	0.494130242299	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.626112180684	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.53457046226	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.422593851466	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.518465329986	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.392987179403	That's right, three pages.

0.0	0.536007641191	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.475484704424	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.402003343579	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.512184457897	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.520161259372	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.

0.0	0.576373568114	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.369389039937	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.484058313286	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.537109792381	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.489525094737	Nine months ago, our campaign began.

0.0	0.409825824058	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.541477878334	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.346408761572	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.524759452302	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.384710117128	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.432948051021	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.

0.0	0.429182823827	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.569539157493	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.51087789003	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.389164680793	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.571020510504	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.

0.0	0.481215647117	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.401557618741	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.373567690143	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.330283160887	We haven't.

0.0	0.444700103821	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.518348337442	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.527796129322	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.

0.0	0.372726395576	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.578185922671	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.508919017247	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
1.0	0.530200647515	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.583215441312	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.361476554548	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.518843089024	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.485898696638	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.535988251066	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.497754310776	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.5925045653	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.475414336856	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.515019171829	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.360130270828	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.358686126533	Well, let me tell you this.

0.0	0.525069839484	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.53720369685	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.464131332536	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.488712330018	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.

0.0	0.49814001706	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.486655512654	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.

0.0	0.388794201617	We need someone to fight for the people.

0.0	0.484058313286	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.520772714024	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.

0.0	0.404272705397	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.515407601667	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
1.0	0.487767756248	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.

0.0	0.412051100829	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?

0.0	0.506565662607	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.541975598975	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.557087799637	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.440016488487	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"

0.0	0.39633696043	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.514704536906	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.

0.0	0.41790936058	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.476878096869	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.533364926817	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.642693993159	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.446398973689	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.553161843861	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.389603823691	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.491891604025	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.469152430767	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.

0.0	0.512998711051	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.373471130121	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.522878961663	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.542750688916	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.454549784411	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.608509591525	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.370047673222	Do I take the product?

0.0	0.528098633939	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.411200215067	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.43549745369	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.611284621423	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.318538618782	I do.
0.0	0.44020321424	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.48364930176	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.712921148281	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.490763394638	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.44399146066	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.382117882142	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.491549639811	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.498253792639	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.526404305678	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.496463130926	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.561052661695	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.439115527261	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.52717637045	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.367059752272	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.464586837869	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.350743805244	I will tell you that.

0.0	0.532187012045	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.381534159088	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.525885377172	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.371695621305	The world has changed.
0.0	0.448137699005	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.397178606109	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.499538173477	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.503354551337	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
1.0	0.501525893875	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.477889628946	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.46445180496	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.50420017934	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.296549487465	Not bad.
0.0	0.580129721553	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.470965554376	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.545999683412	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.580069396141	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.623240231342	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.538952441054	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.431018094416	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.418632646819	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.475088916417	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.576062575562	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.524847708306	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.533788615041	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.406341742178	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.537801809207	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.499711106515	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.332333357072	We're friends.
0.0	0.458006937894	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
1.0	0.525922787768	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.320429006449	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.379343852836	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.578449838539	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.522443818685	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.533355949338	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.545672948933	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.33383221823	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.546984626703	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.481987749448	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.542980118635	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.549653260304	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.339909187824	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.611127284357	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.367944891455	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.376650707546	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.440147692096	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.464621905073	A lot of people have jumped in here.
1.0	0.386083234513	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.511249788973	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.485033255851	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.460700650386	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.439987139138	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.358931208863	I will not do that.
0.0	0.53296495609	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.513824037996	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.5083424108	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.359499144515	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.555658959972	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.587241463581	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.510299200419	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.425207785676	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.358265278277	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.602646906798	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.517342865133	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.378189690063	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.366572989697	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.544253023335	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.542525695392	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
1.0	0.560774760962	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.342623068359	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.442270859766	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.389224348405	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.398254970705	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.421808170319	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.529939772061	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.472281660623	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.359248658725	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.388418124283	What have you got now?
0.0	0.347155956273	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.578263571955	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.563705649764	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.342798162247	I have no idea.
0.0	0.53076377525	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.524961261854	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.353461199509	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.657587516867	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.516498661753	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.516726081358	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.459110357539	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.506552925349	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.475411729435	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.531665076338	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.529446400721	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.485699048057	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.374793435832	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.527352658437	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.558156304101	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.428644597686	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.376751510982	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.388139927676	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.525709324705	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.577930448053	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.353753900301	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.519060869102	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.413388337408	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
1.0	0.537206019537	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.537137867821	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.373704171331	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.428389730148	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.378066645048	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.446375936416	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.42300651125	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.455954317397	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.408474976484	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.408735906331	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.454869915541	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.390083419015	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.579160469305	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.531375422772	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.314012635953	I would change them.
0.0	0.530728910705	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.434195432923	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.540262272415	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.371482753553	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.441386185947	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.384049686284	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.47371819665	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.478803999008	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.511649578863	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.612939593669	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.413290955639	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.465099397886	That cost gets passed on to the people.
1.0	0.57057632348	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.52135240123	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.583552410336	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.4010484705	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.373994898942	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.42756104171	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.531058005305	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.508183167394	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.540949044828	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.534996129348	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.521484900362	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.521637694897	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.442417797309	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.52096218202	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.462029696235	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.491024225859	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.356895061459	I was the architect.
0.0	0.448242637401	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.528837971779	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.602190436202	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.522918072022	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.449184010112	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.542137577874	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.511676032703	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.322985344128	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.482968892089	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.620158670387	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.566557863551	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.537768730559	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.595557813611	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.38908162218	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.312532383676	We need security.
0.0	0.442032308963	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.28569936609	Yes.
0.0	0.432303713172	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.510119878348	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.581973017045	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.461382585922	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.59926184388	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.535178140038	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
1.0	0.515258106679	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.314287572214	Check it out.
0.0	0.33852080946	A brief response.
0.0	0.545546975225	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.331575041461	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.479218739371	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.402547532791	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.444425401968	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.420268949584	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.45344328495	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.470959564917	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.48471471739	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.36490892212	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.51178732286	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.6856462949	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.416547437096	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.453153281969	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.542424645866	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.482079352944	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.365398151102	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.418966397708	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.48251226742	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.462882090332	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.571598919078	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.550730428505	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
