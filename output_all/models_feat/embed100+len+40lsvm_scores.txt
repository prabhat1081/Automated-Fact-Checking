0.0	0.491665286707	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	1.0	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.343086874611	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.495930095312	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.382870079145	We now have a gun on every table.
0.0	0.397799365308	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
1.0	0.449883808836	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.450554263787	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.551746814081	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.479071755404	My wife, Jane, has been -- way back when before I knew her, a foster parent.
0.0	0.452071714485	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.408895829021	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.496547026752	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.573706558587	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.388777094259	They're going to build in Mexico.
0.0	0.350146021077	They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.
0.0	0.585630279501	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.30158592318	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.347809746837	We have to do away with the strawman proposal.
0.0	0.540847003306	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.303361930672	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.550409457048	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.386284106029	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.378671033821	And, they asked about her email situation.
0.0	0.38632012973	This is revolutionary for education in America.
0.0	0.42886511536	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.
0.0	0.373462829712	You know, I like Marco.
0.0	0.33103327293	Now, here's what is going to happen.
0.0	0.304699603377	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.529229868866	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.
0.0	0.36141509456	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.42603901841	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.490030914432	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.483072454454	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.397443743129	My son is not a pair of boots on the ground.
0.0	0.352049533719	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.587681367887	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.382520082623	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.548179806756	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.390506885562	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.383375295219	And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.
1.0	0.613306179423	Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.
0.0	0.38721957752	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.430051758596	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.363554235436	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.551413103817	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.383189663444	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.277690198986	Right.
0.0	0.517924768299	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.358386955255	If he'd like to play, that's fine.
0.0	0.540169987103	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.607411588924	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.476525911428	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.313783406766	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.40297780854	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.35203291086	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
0.0	0.577469861608	I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.
0.0	0.337631307847	I said, "how's it going?"
0.0	0.365619977044	Do the $12 and you would index it.
0.0	0.459136896242	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.345629762393	It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.
0.0	0.377361285451	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.513828576677	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.313783406766	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.484033260668	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.349283980763	The biggest bank in the world is from China.
0.0	0.38381430046	... (inaudible) opening statement.
0.0	0.543187047514	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
1.0	0.598941216941	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.423555661885	David, let me give you a little bit of background here.
0.0	0.617673951014	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.385895424005	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.384035413014	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.367324681851	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.360061204012	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.461753580622	But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that.
0.0	0.614256633994	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.587336222302	If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.
0.0	0.345965238842	And it's-- it's a worthy debate.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.545885397046	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.627871933295	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.375669503554	Let's have a Democratic Syria.
0.0	0.516058670855	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.338504960279	Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.
0.0	0.372309892905	But, bottom line is this is the year 2015.
0.0	0.537905294996	... that's the -- that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration.
0.0	0.491571296279	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.373018864178	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.385861617664	We were the first in the family.
0.0	0.46493769936	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.
0.0	0.285210303854	Never support.
0.0	0.600005475827	And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina, and many other Republican states, that because of their right wing political ideology, are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.621657938331	At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically.
0.0	0.459699637257	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.310504416047	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.380352650579	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.539249995736	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.295662596311	No problem.
0.0	0.296318530302	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.0	It's not true.
0.0	0.368885877305	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.356838380189	That's just media stuff.
0.0	0.370357274044	We don't know anything about that.
0.0	0.284359259244	All right.
0.0	0.336305038336	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.386525019003	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.35740399159	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.538109113743	But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.
1.0	0.54993625867	Twenty-one mass shootings, including one last weekend in Des Moins where three were murdered.
0.0	0.401044855086	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.351764540838	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.595744910694	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.396119036626	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
1.0	0.345364798465	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.526260402804	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
1.0	0.35645240963	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.314410764368	They started in Iowa.
0.0	0.395836235849	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.479951538481	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.517251506355	As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that.
0.0	0.566397235717	He said, "Yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.459645189875	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.549118529456	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.284436668799	Reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.486753447097	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.489483894053	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.545048369135	I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran.
0.0	0.614461786526	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.378955886788	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.595890355037	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.477915813862	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.514360392244	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.429654942949	We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.
0.0	0.60442412041	And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.
0.0	0.459894525246	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.424970163728	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.37118953691	I kind of miss Donald Trump.
0.0	0.610098164538	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.353086905974	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.491022709844	Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors.
0.0	0.388889069687	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.408997528545	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.357814991491	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.539609829737	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.362340455754	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.480380664397	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.494530265041	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
0.0	0.287423657119	We're dying.
0.0	0.565912797675	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.482030997161	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.
0.0	0.485293632725	But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.
0.0	0.579112001228	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.450248025511	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.480013373774	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.290229494716	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.504147673381	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.548362212429	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.598499596507	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.0	So...
0.0	0.530545945212	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
0.0	0.609515697265	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.288499949253	I promise.
0.0	0.496065707018	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.321385433275	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.307383378637	Here's the story.
0.0	0.534347717515	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.531163035894	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.62088228514	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.620886887197	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.461694877436	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.37795052514	We saw what happened in Egypt.
0.0	0.611846517969	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.298078741466	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.516680570599	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.544856254163	They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.
0.0	0.639710313666	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
1.0	0.54806336948	I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded.
0.0	0.644367604453	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.481306619238	But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible.
0.0	0.553764890431	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.589132983151	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.525233892813	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.494410689458	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.45318010037	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.29613682905	Good at email.
0.0	0.490802212433	We need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table.
0.0	0.476870785574	If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
0.0	0.386662724884	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.462403629444	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.358682451223	That's the big leagues.
0.0	0.511287680814	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.
0.0	0.347340750665	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.567675660782	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.386185373154	The first vote hasn't been counted.
0.0	0.283444060534	Maria...
0.0	0.514898229301	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.6158806917	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
1.0	0.41051979098	We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.

0.0	0.366804838507	Here's what I'd do.
0.0	0.392392955445	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.468900551555	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.491074292515	If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.

0.0	0.489780534651	It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them.
0.0	0.583081223294	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.584199942809	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.

0.0	0.485828548132	Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.
0.0	0.540924636935	And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage.
0.0	0.337993607854	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.565036651463	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.520152406039	I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.
0.0	0.389541626794	And it has been amazing to me.
0.0	0.518137717458	The no-fly zone, I would hope, would be also shared by Russia.
0.0	0.616565147401	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.507252208093	I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.
0.0	0.398793787979	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.515148703537	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.372355305063	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.425350997517	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.541491289892	And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?
0.0	0.5684546177	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
0.0	0.570931610753	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.490340804633	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.506236500804	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.
0.0	0.527787324366	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.428340281432	When you come back to me, I'll share that story.
0.0	0.530425009066	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.54711760788	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.397754680962	And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.
0.0	0.313803522289	I never said that.
0.0	0.377355374499	I was there and I saw the debate.
0.0	0.374871123018	That is a pledge that I'm making.
0.0	0.486569471354	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.
0.0	0.550308439205	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.489363937839	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
0.0	0.493750436285	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.474605084383	I want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, which they have not been doing.
0.0	0.331987862365	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.385866170123	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.577856016284	At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.
0.0	0.494684860006	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.585108077751	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.37775999163	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.495363022531	Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.
1.0	0.609455020036	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.

0.0	0.638219327221	Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin.
0.0	0.389096468473	ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.

0.0	0.500865488481	I believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation.
0.0	0.295363110949	They can't.
0.0	0.380971905066	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.493008463479	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.359975465926	Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.
0.0	0.610256393348	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.347647978662	There are a lot of factors involved in that.
0.0	0.503761940125	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.386659774802	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.530388601365	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.547123540431	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.363194688237	Look, I served on...
0.0	0.517677574077	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.550548998607	It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control.
0.0	0.556188456206	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.342971489571	You can't be in favor of defend us...
0.0	0.490491221392	John, the world is a very dangerous place, but the world is not too dangerous of a place for the United States of America, provided we act according to our principles, provided we act intelligently.
0.0	0.379821545857	We have made some good progress.
1.0	0.522784828091	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.383700713889	But I have another one, Ford.
0.0	0.523850286982	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.
0.0	0.384193727896	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.430311163677	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.
0.0	0.585354068797	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.361971895197	The American people are terrified.
0.0	0.38630066188	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.634635637451	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
1.0	0.564753279479	They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
0.0	0.60172103788	And now since this happened" -- it's up in the prison area -- "my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns.
0.0	0.378294930136	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.460464116795	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.361626532404	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.547362886812	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.488525378959	Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.
0.0	0.493155448702	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.299213602732	And universities.
0.0	0.501844134964	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.510715868316	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.537858838144	But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future.
0.0	0.6313923476	Tear down the EPA's blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates.
0.0	0.490135161878	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.581989274651	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.498074894777	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.542411514164	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.517726312166	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.485588065417	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.542542268449	That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities.
0.0	0.297395896095	We needed 60.
0.0	0.638259692735	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.429932884292	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.350001502104	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.612558341287	So, what we want to do is to say, look, we have 11 million people who have been here, many of them for decades.
0.0	0.42898622942	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.454577967162	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.477676683147	We saw a Muslim brotherhood president installed, and then we saw him ousted and the army back.
0.0	0.578210816198	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.463001926209	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.378450958408	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.36295410413	Somebody said -- thank you, darlin'.
0.0	0.377022135205	So I've watched the politicians.
0.0	0.460430922887	We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.612061526604	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.380671596611	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.341254550545	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.357443225468	Chris, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.377782160915	But -- but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages.
0.0	0.327929745519	It was against Assad.
0.0	0.614987965031	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.501246450009	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.387063943541	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.391563698419	Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth.
0.0	0.532018176222	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.371740497803	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.654866457432	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.
0.0	0.60845461342	You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
0.0	0.46528961827	I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it.
0.0	0.283463962516	Let me just...
0.0	0.359866446605	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.485065551172	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.359464541271	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
0.0	0.393435450888	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.0	That's not true.
0.0	0.594975559256	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.488932543989	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.509943542205	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
1.0	0.622311460318	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.573231647446	When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war.
0.0	0.49425843004	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.601477650995	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.576841480031	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.406673823286	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.475639404662	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.455171741019	I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible.
0.0	0.388362414169	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.349947269737	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.374144879634	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.536195008137	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.388476696293	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.490171227765	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.386848622318	You can't hide behind parliamentary tricks.
1.0	0.594393861399	The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.
0.0	0.302508523789	I agree with that.
0.0	0.542502762961	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.483582634835	When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal?
1.0	0.533118958872	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
1.0	0.479763072258	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.372111981868	No hour is too short, no dollar too small.
0.0	0.503404966582	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.391283690002	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.360074037018	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.372345979757	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.538873193741	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.298247494904	Check it out.
0.0	0.393630859292	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.383532933528	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.547279541376	And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details.
0.0	0.357896415399	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.572930672247	You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.
0.0	0.617522649078	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.276907033623	Yeah.
0.0	0.545599857706	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.478319291641	But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.
0.0	0.425640662327	He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long.
0.0	0.540609181495	And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you're a governor.
0.0	0.577559453823	What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people.
1.0	0.495141397069	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.33891121794	And you have to really work hard at it.
0.0	0.367122019529	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.292781349159	For her convenience.
0.0	0.575410402508	And, unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage, I actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.362061015889	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.381019456072	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.459981516066	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.381634047957	I've gotta do it."
0.0	0.302118302265	We have losers.
1.0	0.610347293912	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.462544219878	He said, "we have the military in the streets right now.
0.0	0.49428520772	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.521499822979	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.439759893588	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.51506425905	And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq.
0.0	0.482431738298	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
0.0	0.34789804507	There has never been a jihadist group like this.
0.0	0.353854774126	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.604092554027	By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job.
0.0	0.515615887944	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.344445861059	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.47050377225	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.37557750794	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.290630850521	Number one...
0.0	0.570953829193	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.339880718127	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.495207534264	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.411570919065	Real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years.
0.0	0.455466535436	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.61774665727	I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.
0.0	0.614095266969	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.481993987147	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.434179299088	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.388397590482	But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.363951556245	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.298620597364	Bigger than that?
0.0	0.518027350324	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.40162076042	She is not qualified to be President of the United States.
0.0	0.621160610843	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.549282186761	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.404623868287	But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.
0.0	0.544521794376	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.404040942986	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.479803886836	And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump," and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns.
0.0	0.481737013516	But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired.
0.0	0.281511817354	Let's...
0.0	0.366938313703	That's when we become Greece.
0.0	0.381027994973	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.48389196832	But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
0.0	0.38480691728	I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.
0.0	0.61649402358	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.
0.0	0.350505205954	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.550284083611	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.327929745519	What are we doing?
0.0	0.430815963296	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.382600784342	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.478295446063	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.434168953844	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.61752429517	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
0.0	0.553693488215	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.486293112036	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.358850583874	I'm getting to that.
0.0	0.463972404097	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.359281181719	They wanted Boeing's secrets.
0.0	0.580473422881	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.509643990908	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
1.0	0.36395293369	He's not wall street.
0.0	0.359557407586	Let me (inaudible).

0.0	0.288701213822	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.426264939723	And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China.
0.0	0.500894721565	But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.

0.0	0.353416048565	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.291290254472	Big difference.
0.0	0.477510152878	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.390655459419	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.468779443507	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.

0.0	0.574782358556	You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?
0.0	0.303643674375	We were wrong.
0.0	0.606981411501	But here, a total net worth of -- net worth, not assets, not -- a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets -- Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York -- many other places all over the world.

0.0	0.613266550476	In fact, if you remember, 50, 60 years ago, the University of California, City University of New York were virtually tuition-free.
0.0	0.312306869913	Today I heard it.
0.0	0.301926806869	I have no idea.
0.0	0.363625885161	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.470688719548	That's the difference, and that's the kind of leader we need in the White House.

0.0	0.483981590296	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.310067195029	There is a vacuum.
0.0	0.539116299317	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.409268698028	And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.498320943095	Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.
0.0	0.539541205557	And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?
0.0	0.488006048509	And so people are still going to get health care, thankfully, in emergency rooms, in hospitals.

0.0	0.382086085932	He thinks low wages are a good idea.
0.0	0.62153125736	Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago.
0.0	0.364436734169	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.
0.0	0.288807794477	It was.
0.0	0.539730986977	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.345763200144	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.514110757984	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.540015863334	So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.
0.0	0.54451831317	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.

0.0	0.346265406601	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
1.0	0.543743802887	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.516846531442	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.399455551703	We have people that are morally corrupt.
0.0	0.317524593385	She led that effort.

0.0	0.39033078907	Chris I was mentioned in that question.
0.0	0.579007693092	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.392296079662	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.306094419823	Thank you, senator.

0.0	0.557997833512	My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, which sparked my interest in the need for immigration reform because I know what it's like to be the son of an immigrant.
0.0	0.538922269423	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.545633562544	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.361284908715	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.59439721365	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.651117930029	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.54289692365	Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly.
0.0	0.302231616917	That's not fair.
0.0	0.517135621756	Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them.
0.0	0.364163675637	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.
0.0	0.378290648669	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.566255468686	And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
0.0	0.360692904021	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.464722908425	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
1.0	0.459841315804	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.277671689561	Ask Boeing.
0.0	0.547159891508	Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come...
0.0	0.368917178048	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.376258270651	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.465998081067	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.51152767902	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.612961297716	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.52365320045	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.31264455131	They;re gone.
0.0	0.38697893468	Major crisis and primary health care.
0.0	0.46688172708	First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty.

0.0	0.406848369078	Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.35461498664	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
0.0	0.36913911184	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.508498570866	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.542977306924	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.597168285954	In the 1980s, it was in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Reagan's administration, and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel, and others were murdered.
0.0	0.432303179284	They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.
0.0	0.468197684495	I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House.
0.0	0.387596469227	They were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.513568961184	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.402850745654	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.362922565455	Hey, I have lobbyists.
0.0	0.542607840431	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.
0.0	0.542546480975	I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third.
0.0	0.507011246097	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.408501545482	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.437173068595	Clearly the best piece of veterans' legislation brought forth in decades.
0.0	0.532480234246	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.0	No.

0.0	0.515245416019	Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
1.0	0.59807983437	I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer.
0.0	0.402585949932	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.372850713001	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.548682782257	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.

0.0	0.515220164638	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.527562390011	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.548420938148	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.613604196258	We brought together legislation supported by the American Legion, the VFW, the DOD, Vietnam Vets, all of the veterans organizations, which was comprehensive.

0.0	0.368902019744	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.530665510247	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.

1.0	0.540824656834	We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.427782735158	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.328869721598	And they wanted to make sure it got built.

0.0	0.562359937374	And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young, old, everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.546841373103	Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.

0.0	0.381289195962	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.335941066689	But I would say this to you, Bret.
0.0	0.548813633687	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.548922574864	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.548784411616	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.

0.0	0.386145535556	... and we will end the illegal immigration.
0.0	0.610132249031	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.335688232799	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.506248294535	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.360447538919	This is a bad deal.
1.0	0.603819226839	According to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.583180500545	To tell Qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep.
1.0	0.62011743376	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.606399374753	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.380674792368	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.579068560386	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.517148865497	They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America.
0.0	0.402017788226	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.494340283674	Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris.
0.0	0.283142929584	Neil...
0.0	0.457088484811	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.539053843961	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.373353909599	They've got nothing but money.
0.0	0.545802563509	And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.
0.0	0.0	OK.
0.0	0.611057500027	Every (inaudible) Democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rosa DeLauro, got ears (ph) to legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave.
0.0	0.369358650942	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.570271320714	Now, what the magic number is, I don't know, because we don't know the extent of the problem.
0.0	0.361175002301	So we need people -- I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.516272563472	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.480943475387	When he brought forward the "Gang of Eight" bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.
0.0	0.631758751544	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.571241842523	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.545687209079	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
1.0	0.319131075578	It was below zero.
0.0	0.615207265186	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.533616282852	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.538550784149	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.378096127777	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.56518835667	We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression.
0.0	0.57063245394	Not only -- not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton -- and I hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- I want to apologize to my supporters.
0.0	0.607715926423	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.493803508932	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.385321039084	They had a plan that was good.
0.0	0.365140802808	We've got to hate the Muslims."
0.0	0.57093957457	We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party.
0.0	0.277690198986	Right.
0.0	0.54314422935	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.549570665359	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.600947782594	Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.
0.0	0.37542575581	Your question was you have disagreed...
0.0	0.588359269463	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.616687959953	And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.61335989196	In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.
0.0	0.371613372344	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.59178296579	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.594620262595	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
0.0	0.565980101789	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.382292677937	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.540404282987	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.460169916778	And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't."
0.0	0.582985982949	So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
0.0	0.603693565169	We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up.
0.0	0.404102053672	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.358378398487	But I learned a lot.
0.0	0.52856578946	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.557746397755	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.478593542574	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.608249819935	But, I said, "This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people.
0.0	0.559152346474	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.383872718496	... Chris, your questions that you...
0.0	0.568052885192	If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.
0.0	0.619794618455	As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.580161297741	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.
0.0	0.374428835531	We must able to work collaboratively with others.
0.0	0.613508260931	Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.564765467177	I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.
0.0	0.370555595338	Megyn, that's the problem.
0.0	0.536403293083	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.497645216478	In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...
0.0	0.565142460389	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.371479346087	Bill after coming home from Japan, flying 33 missions.
0.0	0.291160096585	That's right.
0.0	0.490375640564	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.483027868085	And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.
0.0	0.423696449535	People say, "Oh, you don't like China?"
0.0	0.383407048292	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.53609670887	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.541656894451	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
0.0	0.345572422466	This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.
0.0	0.35423396675	We were the first to pass a minimum wage.
0.0	0.557830435627	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...
0.0	0.379474061049	A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.
0.0	0.46705504285	That's not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.
0.0	0.550776625373	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.544584404184	And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.
0.0	0.539936441527	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.535429808342	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.398831506213	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.38835807218	We talked about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.436145287617	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.531895660718	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.57556096688	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.54303236655	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.461964565029	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.50778305955	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.379938716378	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.267935046526	Ever.
0.0	0.552363021834	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...
0.0	0.566088203535	Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?
0.0	0.490561769229	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.571823783835	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.556645305421	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.426791903094	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.371894861481	The troops on the ground should not be American troops.
0.0	0.468818816734	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
0.0	0.306558497658	I changed that.
0.0	0.405812235965	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.348421976956	And we ought to fight them on that level.
0.0	0.379198987059	Please become part of the political revolution.
0.0	0.353328141017	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.362985440322	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.398225246145	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.579987459311	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.294890836982	I don't care.
0.0	0.624588000388	What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.361627221955	They don't have a clue.
0.0	0.547499263264	And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.
0.0	0.368347157755	We bailed out Wall Street.
0.0	0.594407002137	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.434760315091	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.319736578841	And we have nothing.
0.0	0.567409729113	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.309462768688	We now have that.
0.0	0.355710222533	We have the opposite thinking.
0.0	0.645744463185	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.42939146129	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.580188590031	Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.
0.0	0.363652130707	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.552217233169	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.373378919744	We don't have victories anymore.
0.0	0.337818560301	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.487740780213	I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.
0.0	0.402988556212	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.492520267067	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.508450350862	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.458904818622	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.
0.0	0.310605019186	They sweated like dogs.
0.0	0.26863892511	Alright.
0.0	0.619313994069	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.611897999631	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.293352960027	And you know what?
0.0	0.62312828526	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.360018779758	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.369900990259	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.360254048312	That's because we've put conservative policies in place.
0.0	0.617239647318	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.383972311984	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.288807794477	It was...
0.0	0.616188526719	Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.
0.0	0.496668872995	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.562975243784	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.0	OK.
0.0	0.391621206668	And I applaud his record in Maryland.
0.0	0.387238595502	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
1.0	0.539084721532	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.388733586848	He's been a negative force.
0.0	0.356125707607	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.393020763787	We got a U.N. Security council vote.
0.0	0.361176113643	Here's the bottom line.
1.0	0.479263488674	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.618967059148	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.606257258473	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.398273217378	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.514838373959	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
0.0	0.303643674375	He's wrong.
0.0	0.369354703773	But I can tell you this.
0.0	0.432319391097	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.360634200145	There will be a process.
0.0	0.453273027301	Martha, we offered a lot more than they were willing to take.
0.0	0.352693448946	That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.
0.0	0.298288274592	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.604648578113	But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding.
0.0	0.51390827947	I'm going to support you, and I think that is absolutely appropriate.
0.0	0.485924070334	We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it.
0.0	0.277690198986	Right.
0.0	0.465359430673	I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses.
0.0	0.430705224791	The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.493894564036	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.569550740223	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.370399770973	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.370168630534	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.321214889003	She voted for it.
0.0	0.53912472074	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.

0.0	0.486216169022	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.498378836504	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.385549404437	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.576055128128	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
1.0	0.485840249697	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.284359259244	All right.
0.0	0.29817540559	Mark my words.
0.0	0.612508249153	We got it done in my state by leading with principal and that's what we need to do as a party for comprehensive gun safety.
0.0	0.560664955791	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.355539275661	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.607328299436	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.
0.0	0.393834053735	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.0	OK.
0.0	0.471957902318	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.56557711588	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.353214595169	I was in Burlington, Iowa.
0.0	0.518469223283	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.358587439042	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.498110733943	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.31190535797	We are rebuilding China.
0.0	0.28839344269	Not bad.
0.0	0.383430189078	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.372846872238	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.486606999399	But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.
0.0	0.539085764968	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
0.0	0.542636983204	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.537040269376	That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.
0.0	0.582574160403	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.627819263082	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.47348096764	But, of course, international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today.
0.0	0.494684267337	We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate.
0.0	0.570628849076	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.613098661689	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.393287734116	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.540821517234	We're spending $80 billion locking people up, disproportionately Latino and African American.
0.0	0.370545391379	Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.
0.0	0.47729852097	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.57419477765	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.622792073047	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.432958077128	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.364648106492	It's affordable for everybody.
0.0	0.359645699323	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.362700500519	He is a good man.
0.0	0.50686061177	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.463155657526	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.358358205168	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.354593350326	I know the bad ones.
0.0	0.293243548119	That is exactly...
0.0	0.353733688478	He's a progressive economist.
0.0	0.49080995771	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.541368074325	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.533169987352	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.364909262001	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.389112833594	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.622545242187	When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish Glass-Stegall.
0.0	0.584410088799	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.430510713409	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.336143187959	And we're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.470396576545	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.376606959008	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.360187727133	... but wait a minute...
0.0	0.35682032611	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.4318611423	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.0	No.
1.0	0.515052037436	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.558264918814	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.547896794115	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.0	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.309731541065	Can you believe this?
0.0	0.377760837748	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.482589161076	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.327929745519	What should we do?
0.0	0.546490949338	And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.
0.0	0.552980030226	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.294230016851	We're running.
0.0	0.463241389446	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.370061527253	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.556766138849	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.511213241992	Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.
0.0	0.614109297054	And the U.S. chamber of commerce, which hardly ever says nice things about Democratic governors anywhere, named our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship.
0.0	0.301970114315	You count on it.
0.0	0.355050877563	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.548795209907	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.390439408006	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.293352960027	And you know what?
0.0	0.362277651738	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.404141226047	this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.
0.0	0.301189802873	About Medicare?
0.0	0.550081603689	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.553587407974	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
1.0	0.571906318601	And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
0.0	0.428265536904	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.547047945167	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.472201845009	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
1.0	0.54412533071	We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks a piece.
0.0	0.475281916763	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.373884644049	Let's get rid of Assad later.
0.0	0.463543083594	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
1.0	0.621694902882	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.55365785197	It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.
0.0	0.337106154101	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.546686602327	Then, in 2008, you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying that we don't need those regulations on the federal level and now you're coming back around here.
0.0	0.482585229496	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.518038017657	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.501117689093	That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive.
0.0	0.514125700673	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.387136719022	In this building, in Trump Tower.
0.0	0.537523427655	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.610659328898	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.51052183782	Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.
0.0	0.549040344327	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.509943164323	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.47332333431	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.548069360929	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.363536379012	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.503979207278	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.392151465335	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.42545525412	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.541227028761	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.303947030659	Well, thank you.
0.0	0.309107572442	You can do both.
0.0	0.550245044209	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.290187875545	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.296888223088	That's fine.
0.0	0.357443099511	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.606529435843	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.51017229291	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.28521082135	Good evening.
1.0	0.556355398355	And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.
0.0	0.478108080033	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.379919399362	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.458709761176	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.379603846305	... and I'd like to respond.
1.0	0.463620163731	Unfortunately, Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, set about decimating it.
1.0	0.540970102487	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.462845987116	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.396764684816	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
0.0	0.432751538318	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.303685010085	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.52393648264	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.387559238001	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
1.0	0.629223089391	In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.
0.0	0.592838429126	They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.549728813221	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.584611241176	And that's only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.
0.0	0.514391194909	And look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that.
0.0	0.600975677247	Well, you know, governor, I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010.
0.0	0.469532295909	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.508123916909	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.35436826851	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.310414790157	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.376875768261	I said, "Is he intelligent?"
0.0	0.370167264186	So -- because we got to make the country rich.
0.0	0.536143392977	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.312767280718	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.354638687774	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.521451177865	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.37691392712	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.545953666502	Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs.
0.0	0.335339654902	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.533886148609	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.367950605613	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.
0.0	0.576362608372	When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it.
0.0	0.529097190556	And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.
0.0	0.458886897045	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.375389663776	So, yes, I did know people.
0.0	0.517088829897	... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do.
0.0	0.342602738122	How the hell can you vote for this guy?
0.0	0.545999897459	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.386659770097	That can be done without profiling people.
0.0	0.548667230709	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.479240522969	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.484458107112	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
1.0	0.546132267868	People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.
0.0	0.472451941853	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.623039736516	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.571111199318	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.351343285584	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.512128434467	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.409638104375	When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
0.0	0.53698489395	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.3018371259	But not for us.
0.0	0.533004879097	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.382636300916	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.531959213364	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.404532922737	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.366841435229	Germany, many other countries do it already.
0.0	0.277047311615	We know...
0.0	0.462274605064	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.551621833569	But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.
0.0	0.625520812885	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.356032691111	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.630050408152	I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.
0.0	0.390439408006	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.331873177114	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.553667463266	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.543155622386	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.575653259922	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.494149943315	But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything.
0.0	0.305930164949	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.377582952231	Why don't you wait in line?

0.0	0.382202129138	People that know me, like me.
0.0	0.624148559092	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.531465819373	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
1.0	0.425868319273	It didn't say a word about legalization.
0.0	0.366946595689	That's what we believe in.
0.0	0.62130514011	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.

0.0	0.386908160402	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.495741845376	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.

0.0	0.370211092966	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.370848467299	It's great to be at Trump Tower.
0.0	0.36016695923	Border security has always been a part of that debate.
0.0	0.460903449163	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
0.0	0.380926112031	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.393351726355	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.310871673878	My point is this.
0.0	0.357106879542	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.480499936925	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.378020899434	You learn that threats always change.
0.0	0.357119680579	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.560445873828	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.482390992708	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.541697705515	Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country.
0.0	0.55255118588	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.364096463879	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.361375079777	It's not about Donald Trump.
0.0	0.392560958094	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.387725316781	He's actually a negative force.
0.0	0.463539808988	But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
0.0	0.518177820384	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.385683988841	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.299045583758	...Chris...
0.0	0.402758461925	Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.
0.0	0.36084912597	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.565068060973	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.574388105717	As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.
0.0	0.281654654782	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.398503485208	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.573373844203	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.589534789308	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.359576913905	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.627599541772	Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.370828193898	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.416729953821	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.349353386893	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.616335351122	That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
0.0	0.295537363539	I love China.
0.0	0.51658268077	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.514443090417	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.523170430681	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.276907033623	Yeah.
0.0	0.497193580168	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.
0.0	0.391010190357	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.583158364928	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.548012005907	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.548309549194	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.370020321674	The administration originally said 10.
0.0	0.41731699216	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.508254440366	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.485125091344	These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy, and our economic power in alignment with our principles.
0.0	0.533932493515	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.469983193897	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.52231079792	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.342640786275	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.604763431329	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.
0.0	0.60844471077	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.502532388904	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.379965939841	Quite likely, for that reason.
0.0	0.378621670866	You can go to my website...
0.0	0.312195293005	That's crony capitalism.
0.0	0.568697692517	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.542945971938	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.381329598934	I gotta do it, Dad.
0.0	0.279264313907	...
0.0	0.549255742111	Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage.
0.0	0.367273089604	And we do have a role in this.
0.0	0.539745733528	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.288807794477	It is.
0.0	0.567085754108	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.478039629211	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
0.0	0.298431327727	He's very charming.
0.0	0.586202908308	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.
0.0	0.388359973988	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.491442028089	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.513945424392	Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
0.0	0.575531542573	And then on top of that, we've got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are pouring huge sums of money into super PACS heavily influencing the political process.
0.0	0.575386023265	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.361834556357	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.49130883236	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.501294108579	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.365528343469	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.404042612214	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.378483357967	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.513899430698	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.
0.0	0.558344237216	And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity.
0.0	0.311801584114	From top to bottom.
0.0	0.472883277694	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.369154166902	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.354575083924	I have a wonderful family.
0.0	0.346599755304	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.357201078054	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.288807794477	It is.
0.0	0.578941372493	In fact, American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the National Institute of Health and that we then tested through the FDA.
0.0	0.389674667577	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.597667478795	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.362476529825	They serve in the military.
0.0	0.395238190366	Support community banks and credit unions.
0.0	0.401708895455	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.337615057035	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.357521533687	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.487547195152	Since, you know, the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody.
0.0	0.541916706277	Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face.
0.0	0.402548631412	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.553784177384	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.514246376045	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.504535496668	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
0.0	0.50036012078	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.276641020837	Whoa.
0.0	0.48657417137	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
1.0	0.540576760647	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.447631183653	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.546522786248	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.623356813311	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.596743703914	But bottom line now, is in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or her family.
0.0	0.430860441026	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.36154460183	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.546657295669	And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country.
0.0	0.353882931526	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.544031407125	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.355814209936	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.355891316036	It certainly does cover it.
0.0	0.521631148774	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.42077169342	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.491799095632	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.553428140822	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.346370277997	Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world.
0.0	0.605583567869	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.542068651712	... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience.
0.0	0.429170633546	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.545086719046	The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.
0.0	0.569050778488	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.37268793286	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.360155498955	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.390834901529	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.363833743343	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.289261142707	Everybody should.
0.0	0.387812396247	She's the senator from New York.
0.0	0.547643866025	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.392313834326	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.507039781034	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
1.0	0.55927084516	Nancy, the blueprint in Maryland that we followed was yes, we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment.
1.0	0.487520019751	You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small.
0.0	0.619904666675	It was the most highly sought after -- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
0.0	0.577766376942	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.371839913527	You've got to go the extra mile.
0.0	0.530408196304	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.553408949906	They're controlled fully -- they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
0.0	0.386519569824	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.360563193964	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.611078158378	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.505784612175	And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.
0.0	0.288807794477	You did.
0.0	0.378490232856	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.468700399197	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.359042774463	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.561918408469	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.514302030556	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.327929745519	What do we do?
0.0	0.545282104033	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.541201734397	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.

0.0	0.608640534793	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.546081458781	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.355784764051	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.595586685696	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.

0.0	0.490799938801	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.38357127602	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.313482412863	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.493310955205	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.590763505429	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."

0.0	0.461343139969	There were parts of that bill which agree with parts -- I disagree.
0.0	0.351590182388	They're off to China.
0.0	0.308237230774	We actually did it.
0.0	0.373180847117	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.549280677766	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.367650949162	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.494082615847	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.309726629907	You have to lead.
0.0	0.518291596597	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.

0.0	0.362242311056	How can you get people to vote for you?"
0.0	0.538333264411	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.382050336779	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.627166422983	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.387601542062	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.502441181806	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.356297346659	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.520048217467	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.293874872795	The mentally ill?
0.0	0.490746034149	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.382348540664	Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
0.0	0.497735556399	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.552304211294	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.355704103767	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.381278427629	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.375295648293	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.549199395303	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.520598977254	And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.54352286769	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.462126150888	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
0.0	0.364415283478	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.347045108373	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.372424978105	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.607941845418	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.356218265958	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.61110430903	I think we need major reform in the military, making it more cost effective, but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us.
0.0	0.428316295841	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.567666247866	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.490347543478	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.302630265191	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.529357346946	And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.545787004765	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.496522173234	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.38043818381	That's what should be done.
0.0	0.309995673622	It's not working.
0.0	0.47468328834	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.
0.0	0.556440259071	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.366883593786	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.547409047452	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.406641987988	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.277047311615	They know.
0.0	0.364343723869	I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.
0.0	0.352045307059	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.353416048565	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.369665495585	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
0.0	0.290515251081	I really am.
0.0	0.557543939493	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.361549003652	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.378631832143	I'd like to offer a...
0.0	0.300299141467	Don't know that.
0.0	0.391540339097	... saying, no middle class tax raises.
0.0	0.557482015588	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
0.0	0.305538719064	I was for legalization.
0.0	0.480124326394	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.296318530302	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.581204315526	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.366126340011	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.60343425558	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.360184530829	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.341667626825	But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble.
0.0	0.370973744484	Marco opposed this because they made a deal.
0.0	0.576295050054	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.358344111818	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.301664219155	Both served.
0.0	0.58812922612	Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.
0.0	0.528837575833	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
0.0	0.521786038203	This is not a conflict where we send in the third divisions of Marines.
0.0	0.420565432344	And he'll say, "Please, please, please."
0.0	0.505332731948	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.365309032631	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.538024508159	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.485760809536	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
1.0	0.60048692352	Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.
1.0	0.350728634885	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.297666386218	I'll do it.
0.0	0.4202176607	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.518893445301	Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.
0.0	0.535793166344	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
0.0	0.396807775634	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.0	Both.
0.0	0.538729488244	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.55205959539	Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.
0.0	0.540536487588	If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.
0.0	0.574548865534	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.355830210447	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.301217081932	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.570827768443	It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
0.0	0.301742809988	We are not France.
0.0	0.391860934179	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.597688616298	So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there.
0.0	0.557154580669	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
0.0	0.501409571828	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.485754526311	So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.363988164779	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.515797560123	Well, there are so many, I don't know where to start.
0.0	0.36299802219	Making fun of disabled people...
1.0	0.365823188836	A lot of people up there can't get jobs.
0.0	0.298247494904	Check it out.
0.0	0.312195293005	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.400196741564	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.381004515888	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.503423089701	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.400001199513	I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country.
0.0	0.588094440733	But accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000.
0.0	0.538843344691	And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.
0.0	0.387408169082	I think it's a two-pronged issue.
0.0	0.561985969062	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.575232241252	The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders.
0.0	0.359221263664	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.369059457249	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.580017634329	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.303692540352	This is absolutely absurd.
0.0	0.486185319194	I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
0.0	0.571718322221	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.
0.0	0.530783955738	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.370882608852	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.598335231255	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.342125091983	So, I thank you very much for that.
1.0	0.422585505691	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
0.0	0.344340068197	And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.

0.0	0.295880489914	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.578613180846	There's too much -- it's like -- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
0.0	0.53864005382	How does that help us?  TRUMP R 15 94 1 N Where is that good?
0.0	0.367823423779	$1 billion a day.
0.0	0.588841254868	But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.
0.0	0.35663503127	That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable.
0.0	0.581054145474	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.

0.0	0.546961306938	Now, our country needs -- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
0.0	0.313803522289	I never said that.
0.0	0.356282725894	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.549193399264	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.378204125653	But I went further than that.
0.0	0.554938948373	One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this, is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations.
0.0	0.497737574402	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.485486544778	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.392069629868	None of that information was looked at.
0.0	0.364471689726	That is our government today.
0.0	0.536482867095	We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
0.0	0.386265306538	And I apologize to nobody for that.
0.0	0.479183644381	... First of all -- Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.553279502074	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.360131823984	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.

0.0	0.508887744226	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
1.0	0.614034385526	When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.
0.0	0.602589079557	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.470201536487	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
0.0	0.570367547167	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.298122985475	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.4801236061	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.39729520226	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.357066591379	I would just say that...

0.0	0.361422949774	This is a complicated issue.
0.0	0.611783558444	Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild.
0.0	0.541140870162	There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
0.0	0.488984222461	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.
0.0	0.534478739001	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.617717769939	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.543524194636	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.358253321677	We can build the fence.
0.0	0.460198073228	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.302857996481	They've advertised that.
0.0	0.550680779282	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.541178753444	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
0.0	0.547012732164	And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.584472500185	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.
0.0	0.467939671737	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.525758021154	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.566999939224	If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen.
0.0	0.37659121167	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.6174079469	I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.

0.0	0.539188953512	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.541992986023	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.606694403927	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.
0.0	0.299213540057	I tell you that.
0.0	0.55151349539	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.357941905842	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.580908692552	All through the recession, we defended the highest median income in America and the second highest median income for African American families.
0.0	0.527530217945	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.558508846237	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.371104931816	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.281511817354	Let me...
0.0	0.374104693083	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.39045801903	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.501550791732	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.40623102874	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.483815380803	Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe.
0.0	0.458220634409	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.419743850049	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.311814150439	That is abundantly clear.
0.0	0.583393527609	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.358343721409	We defended the highest median income in the country.
0.0	0.455009562654	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.542275161817	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
1.0	0.546276810694	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.407987026824	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.310307963459	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.495588310498	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.413059029475	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.484603409222	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.619331993791	This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.
0.0	0.466399180812	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.374920610291	Look, the secretary is right.
0.0	0.521827275747	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.
0.0	0.361029151114	We saw a dictator overthrown.
0.0	0.54962161073	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.605839515158	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.496108248117	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.491612955835	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.5393223631	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.
0.0	0.394505207823	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.54113696144	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.481855987096	So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.
0.0	0.340800438475	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.548039802011	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
1.0	0.528494985547	I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians.
0.0	0.539745961965	You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying.
0.0	0.0	But...
0.0	0.548215027507	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.343131612344	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.3804249854	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.616805841296	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.578429189285	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.336995653361	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.366677330964	They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.
0.0	0.581882316955	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.620220117667	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.348056563863	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
0.0	0.389587668088	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.538955243921	Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.
0.0	0.542268790491	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.376017481099	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.384379407716	That is why we need to make...
0.0	0.511480188988	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.315028537044	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.367647476526	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.500714393698	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.

0.0	0.373509134971	We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
0.0	0.543315391168	There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction.
0.0	0.365320936825	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.454651716093	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
0.0	0.422963549538	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.368401330147	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.484406632309	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.54653192613	The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.
0.0	0.579229873709	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.428523273081	I think the issue here is -- and I applaud Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.611028461054	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.477155987013	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.463239659098	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.510483878604	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.389230496424	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.36021029833	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.550612879651	And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
0.0	0.358711089185	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.509330386841	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.38289868667	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.29288709744	That's really nice.
0.0	0.362142440598	Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk.
0.0	0.472287892828	But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
0.0	0.291160096585	That's right.
0.0	0.46934736706	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.462842798392	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.512363692361	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.525478339175	So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years -- you know, we're at $8 trillion now.
0.0	0.510540077797	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.306914545314	How would we act?
0.0	0.515668693268	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
1.0	0.625713182924	But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works.
0.0	0.58195949011	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.542552326561	But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks.
0.0	0.475728331732	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.292087411693	Can we stop?
0.0	0.462218518221	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.341927198944	I said, "I don't know."
0.0	0.484079331577	And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.
0.0	0.360210958053	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.558558424514	We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.
0.0	0.542742780681	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.534593042286	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.482748337506	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.389285615177	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.385663700665	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.392271191784	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
1.0	0.587043486108	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.545976423184	Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.
0.0	0.567903394263	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.
0.0	0.28657214586	You're right.
0.0	0.364686234549	It costs me $3.
0.0	0.360367200653	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.499009231138	But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.276907033623	Yeah.
0.0	0.456617525106	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.518177820384	And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said.
0.0	0.427741451416	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.45355211957	I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom.
0.0	0.37746548557	This guy is a petulant child.

0.0	0.462061781765	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.375125833229	I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail.
0.0	0.518046020951	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.401989917438	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
1.0	0.61872631419	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.617954761852	Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.
0.0	0.543174424889	And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition, including Russia, to help us destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.352787180445	They don't like that.
0.0	0.376117435743	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.549336095554	... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.
0.0	0.666211579337	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.353315795161	And we can do it.
0.0	0.379969158628	Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.582160458718	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.364134236282	Great state, great people.
1.0	0.512029062069	And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent.
0.0	0.558502691964	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.56365596852	Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS.
0.0	0.360274271562	You know, Ted didn't show up.
0.0	0.299034145385	They're not wrong.
1.0	0.634503559518	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.359879219283	There are other racial discrepancies.

0.0	0.35737636961	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.362196293487	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.487765898279	And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.582001813712	So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
0.0	0.570559265617	When we put money into the hands of working people, they're going to go out and buy goods, they're going to buy services and they're going to create jobs in doing that.

0.0	0.335198010969	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
1.0	0.579505207427	In fact, wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century, after my husband's administration.
0.0	0.372490382894	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
0.0	0.580160690133	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.583281380001	I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries.
0.0	0.363552118658	I heard what they said.
0.0	0.605631786043	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.550905756583	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.466234903667	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.581159818661	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.48829248131	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.365102377343	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.579208139944	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.380443985843	I am not the candidate of Wall Street...
0.0	0.404728347669	We reduced violent crime to 30-year lows.
0.0	0.480683566308	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.546611456482	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.327929745519	No, you did.
0.0	0.39771146567	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
1.0	0.604731620342	And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.
0.0	0.431001888696	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.520470287829	They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?
0.0	0.541430171547	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.545880035832	Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate.
0.0	0.558273141627	You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down.
0.0	0.303406986129	Syria is a mess.
0.0	0.343774869679	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.379646379478	He believes everything he stands for.
0.0	0.554819469746	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.367398774949	Could I just say -- just say this...
0.0	0.515419348632	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.
0.0	0.559490121396	Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country -- we would never build in an ocean.
0.0	0.613862477453	We didn't win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America.
0.0	0.6098232473	I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out.
0.0	0.539055175303	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.361737599472	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.383702456373	They can't even answer simple questions.
0.0	0.469507712267	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.576420662824	David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave.
0.0	0.476914594124	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.377131290165	Who denies that it is crazy...
0.0	0.369590004876	Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers.
0.0	0.0	But...
0.0	0.386815364278	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.
0.0	0.305047574382	That's American citizenship.
0.0	0.42730231876	But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.603094624284	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.524650008065	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.367825454407	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
1.0	0.354940612787	Don't believe the 5.6.
0.0	0.575298255025	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.357561096166	Got to be on the floor of the Senate.
0.0	0.370614953206	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.432532923928	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.285218343717	We get Bergdahl.
0.0	0.346307898355	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.302809090699	Excuse me, no.
0.0	0.427456116937	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.3558427486	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.302814102749	The big banks--
0.0	0.540063175522	I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.
0.0	0.333563569389	Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid.
0.0	0.648047361213	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.
0.0	0.379110425587	He's the one that did Bergdahl.
0.0	0.380560837173	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.552003655835	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.563310122611	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.471565073829	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.299331845099	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.367251054123	Obama is going to be out playing golf.
0.0	0.57191306144	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.436377491816	But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.371561051236	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.501274231807	Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple.
0.0	0.543418781901	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.402106560879	We should be supportive of that effort.
0.0	0.58015121026	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.500991288847	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.307899298166	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.543522668504	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.423661967905	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.499390214805	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.404829269839	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.36195751528	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.372214787504	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.478704856331	But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate.
0.0	0.37059079082	I am glad Donald is running.
0.0	0.549003423892	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.399978795189	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.369484350182	ISIS, now, is the major priority.
0.0	0.361822044191	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.549562329506	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.352787180445	I don't like that.
0.0	0.532558564425	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.320288912476	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.433504992899	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.580860221291	And he also had no trouble appointing an investment banker to be in charge of his consumer protection bureau when he was governor.
0.0	0.550396374241	I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security.
0.0	0.309980304014	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.456746502425	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.361792511258	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.6237694726	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.316187268534	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.371012096292	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.619418672524	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.582673621503	Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.
0.0	0.359504733098	We got nothing but problems.
0.0	0.0	I like them.
1.0	0.502494932801	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.362998196486	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.625389867272	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.486226667171	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.354619682472	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.359358662179	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.3706097818	We can't even go there.
0.0	0.397690690745	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.380432746886	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.301896125243	I've done it.
0.0	0.351061683931	So did you, Marco.
0.0	0.301202733622	How stupid are they?
0.0	0.392921785639	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.390506885562	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.549763686693	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.
0.0	0.574045994991	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.463899760368	I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...
0.0	0.398780574551	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.399136062115	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.579341225073	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.611220667395	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.580945378116	But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone.
0.0	0.424267666377	But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."
0.0	0.290003246477	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.309845132347	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.477254638808	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.543847612193	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.35951737558	We're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.487985673161	So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again.
0.0	0.295994320861	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.37082026482	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.371257416785	We are doing both at the same time.
0.0	0.549273646616	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
0.0	0.434021274615	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.379399869196	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
1.0	0.507378646465	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.478446269161	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.367825454407	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.55265197493	You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56 percent, equivalent to 56 percent of the GDP In America.
0.0	0.371120681906	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.483744960203	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.614414703641	And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow.
0.0	0.512739893702	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.362860401579	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.614170784184	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.497170129121	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.626786036814	Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts.
0.0	0.475389593826	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.
0.0	0.612476996865	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.52949848132	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.358664173159	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.523706263063	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.374905648761	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.367177559191	I was mentioned in the question.
1.0	0.34612882989	And some of them are like third world countries.
0.0	0.551412270715	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.596599355414	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.504863897237	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.536206635925	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.295090001162	Who are we kidding?
0.0	0.583402365596	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.373443865357	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.498088325352	I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.
0.0	0.38576317562	... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.
0.0	0.377058850157	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.307116788464	You bet they do.
0.0	0.395196990525	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.611115864583	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.290881052702	It's nice.
0.0	0.342266672008	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.
0.0	0.29432712013	He sure did.
0.0	0.384549923242	Nobela (ph) is a rising entrepreneur.
1.0	0.437916686728	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.428554497346	It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York.
0.0	0.612503935691	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.
0.0	0.276907033623	Yeah.
0.0	0.510237595024	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.409827362076	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.324718599239	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.372441356142	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.361618955611	And I watch the speeches.
0.0	0.350291369779	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.288807794477	But what...
0.0	0.467153964568	(APPLAUSE) They're trying to prevent people from registering to vote.
0.0	0.510616111344	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.574029140181	You know, on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign, I was in Keene, and I was asked what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?
0.0	0.379157538432	Bret, we're just starting.
0.0	0.364775026329	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.354861031842	We know about the Belgians.
0.0	0.435347645448	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.363302948621	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.478583272921	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.380437893601	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.542003544306	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.545371705207	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.611674372435	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.497176809364	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.459883433717	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.293352960027	And you know what?
0.0	0.405187757929	I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
0.0	0.303404253001	I said no.
0.0	0.545946492302	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.557855659619	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.353220589146	We don't need that.
0.0	0.313288153571	It is a disaster.
0.0	0.544025828149	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.403499143038	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.341128775321	And that is what we have done in Ohio.
0.0	0.357529409241	Just get me a job.
0.0	0.34163003788	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.505641860988	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.
0.0	0.408320874866	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
0.0	0.535885249413	They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do.
0.0	0.362161373888	I just want a job.
0.0	0.52637454593	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
0.0	0.383507291342	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.382380568705	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.289003340685	Well, sure.
0.0	0.62370817682	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
0.0	0.303081449892	He was vibrant.
0.0	0.550895820333	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.573863611351	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.35737636961	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.519257571924	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.548379077202	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.598646539163	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.456963479371	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.361728286454	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.534553206389	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.395471512315	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.387258925543	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.358350048728	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.587262267015	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.544445903184	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.514293861325	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.542431600881	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.333471763737	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.491951802776	But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.
0.0	0.428288660501	And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.
1.0	0.631822831031	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.58142670839	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
1.0	0.518744785468	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.371578340073	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.354768893746	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.463463205972	And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.
0.0	0.379191585212	Well, thank you, John.
0.0	0.339695295582	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.428224628019	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.28746200341	You want one?
0.0	0.394343536432	I released 34 years of tax returns...
0.0	0.548025639688	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.477559578427	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.335001812791	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.386068853566	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.574025156681	We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.
0.0	0.538097603556	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.618821819948	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.540187216563	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.35840721043	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.313593650651	Just for the record.
1.0	0.632437049886	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
0.0	0.374317964746	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.391143519468	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.564337164919	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.395492833759	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.470952598268	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.383382886801	DICKERSON: A question from Kathie Obradovich.
0.0	0.544111213146	We have a lot of work to do, to better prepare our nation and to better lead this world into this new century.
0.0	0.547923575985	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.37033837842	And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition.
0.0	0.408191698268	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.355908974564	You can change your mind.
0.0	0.379897017057	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.479927967064	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.545988602153	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.343487559808	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.30991176216	I will be ready.
0.0	0.549138169188	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
1.0	0.36448211562	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.379498419519	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.356783057552	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.607310335698	So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
0.0	0.308538105053	Let me say this.
0.0	0.403965209173	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.363472955445	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.582341357055	But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.
0.0	0.437012913008	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...
0.0	0.404948430666	Well, I've got news for you, we can.
0.0	0.595802125849	You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.
0.0	0.343256136282	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.454309974233	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.549761885574	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.432373323095	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
1.0	0.311641298736	They're bringing crime.
0.0	0.347767405812	So, your original question is the right question.
0.0	0.319595381696	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.383354777561	There are hundreds of things like that.
0.0	0.516551917582	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.301493646762	We all understand that.
0.0	0.409963716805	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.482786384642	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.551330659087	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.384914685428	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.0	Wait a minute.
0.0	0.546572170537	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.333920622414	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.603131381894	And the answer is: Because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda.
0.0	0.494443842413	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.305136749973	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.367428139261	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.484044644012	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.367950512465	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.55453042329	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.585735366398	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.290721196804	I introduced...
0.0	0.612022765355	And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.
0.0	0.509493711092	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.353958190566	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.377346330895	And we do have to form a coalition.
1.0	0.394716933406	Today, we have 272.
0.0	0.584335355174	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.329351527078	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.598114478408	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.387265778162	That's a hard road to walk.
0.0	0.304013797986	No -- no...
0.0	0.394374520303	And, here's what she said to the American people.
0.0	0.539315355411	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.311092073948	$24 trillion.
0.0	0.577838788199	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.383281184807	As governor, we continued to work together.
0.0	0.385026561896	Well, I would just repeat that.
0.0	0.298145964622	That means education.
0.0	0.381806708051	We need to figure this out together.
1.0	0.389701967112	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.388363937249	So nice, thank you very much.
0.0	0.385748977124	And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
0.0	0.385916317893	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.534462910299	Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare?
0.0	0.423123404948	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.282229217812	Enough said.
0.0	0.377404936454	We went after those who had attacked us.
0.0	0.363531220678	I don't think a halt is necessary.
0.0	0.495414623611	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
1.0	0.546081980774	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.609763695796	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.566396315391	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.360151662588	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.382525840665	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.363536379012	We're up 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.29531515443	Divide that out.
0.0	0.57116606782	I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.
0.0	0.548038658046	And we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.
0.0	0.364911104304	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.608491881851	When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.588479404426	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.487750186518	And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.
0.0	0.539283831446	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.511612133119	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.370428623952	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.5544866697	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.385919517588	Now we're having smaller families.
1.0	0.562084816848	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.

0.0	0.344285009606	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.621814549651	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.303194577651	But I...
0.0	0.357784981815	That is an egregious act.
0.0	0.356845239272	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.382596373526	Jeb, please attack Ted..."
0.0	0.578945751315	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.543145868809	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
0.0	0.340997934346	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.544332625839	Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.
0.0	0.395124610034	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.498124838293	I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.

0.0	0.546141487843	Furthermore, in a competitive global economy, it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world.
0.0	0.358495906697	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.39543597597	I don't think we're at war with all Muslims.
0.0	0.478902777923	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.371113448552	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.551243200847	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.

0.0	0.54641895419	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.537789307702	Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.
0.0	0.468776355425	And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.
0.0	0.384715099764	KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.
0.0	0.596246463002	We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress, but it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us.
0.0	0.619861569273	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.375476306383	He's the greatest show on earth.
0.0	0.351190742899	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.

0.0	0.382436023467	The other issue is mental health.

0.0	0.603233733312	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.356609633313	They wouldn't be there except for us.
0.0	0.362679952331	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
0.0	0.533084809823	We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.
0.0	0.438705480219	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
0.0	0.45880232207	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.

0.0	0.595281404346	When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.
0.0	0.372811784018	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.553117634327	I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
0.0	0.362127694154	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.351518274097	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.356344065781	Marco, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.494447749719	Good company.... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in -- and I wouldn't even use -- you know, I have -- I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.455923518337	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.309385125439	You know why three?
0.0	0.358546982591	What have you got now?
0.0	0.539191643813	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
0.0	0.406828909727	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.537103725905	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.489832973252	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.359097608394	Then I looked at Rubio.
0.0	0.384041132961	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.542515473668	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.356676810226	But I would add this.
0.0	0.0	I was not at all.
0.0	0.547864192393	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.488569481738	I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.
0.0	0.531645447488	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.35799659614	Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done.
0.0	0.541961280275	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.3571105017	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.370232290125	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.477432283885	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.
0.0	0.418424110644	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.381788034898	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
0.0	0.557105181278	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.612607954873	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.545369772735	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.493955183835	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.462028536431	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.347491330413	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.388267696758	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.515547948748	But he used to say, "Donald, don't go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.0	These...
0.0	0.455867907835	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.563943082218	I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.
0.0	0.357561193055	It really is important that we go forward on this.
0.0	0.405961375978	My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.
0.0	0.369523252698	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.350140655872	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.62205200129	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.433835239298	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.497361307241	And also -- also, what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health care outcomes are not necessarily that good.
0.0	0.30302287283	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.350995190805	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.37138207649	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.363079822199	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.355534698064	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.475945628296	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.520555193572	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.372391990449	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.313196831941	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.582117345114	She has devoted her life, when I was mayor of the city of Burlington, actually when I first met her, we started a youth office, which started a after-school programs for kids, started a child care center, started a youth newspaper.
0.0	0.480742372796	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.464336492846	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.302060014611	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.617194084083	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.475105909446	This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.
0.0	0.474539028373	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.539658028721	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.394477199487	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.570963521749	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.386084909775	We actually passed a living wage.
0.0	0.399181828641	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.486496464535	We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.
0.0	0.494818193609	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.343742567492	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.548555286921	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.362264157346	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.574307536425	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.539094098913	And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.
0.0	0.355604105453	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.489423619468	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.
0.0	0.300396967959	It's a joke.
0.0	0.515752642157	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.290352321882	John?
0.0	0.38206239631	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.589458211001	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.494993965618	Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.
0.0	0.358013926016	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.481910198329	Well, I think it's perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid.
0.0	0.579121246307	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.
1.0	0.386081681928	They just built a hotel in Syria.
0.0	0.520860844897	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.363269840827	And, look, there are profound differences...
0.0	0.363726897769	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.622325270095	My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves.
0.0	0.386258240059	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.369148576876	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.538960681732	I'm an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I miss doing eye surgery, still get to do a little bit.
0.0	0.553489023091	I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.
0.0	0.510756995715	We have got to come forward with a consensus that in fact will work.
0.0	0.392118044677	We are at war with violent extremism.
0.0	0.454527075435	They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn.
0.0	0.459385012548	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.376968078003	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.60988127476	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.496230625504	I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader.
0.0	0.404369109884	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.574994646426	Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.
0.0	0.56008997763	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.382266365836	And we also need a cheerleader.
0.0	0.382159297385	I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.561245467088	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.62070428793	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
0.0	0.409901000074	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.540758556655	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.367424413135	But Obamacare kicks in in 2016.
0.0	0.480440693497	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.504821630742	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.0	Don't do it."
0.0	0.530116874072	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.276907033623	Yeah.
0.0	0.543670445073	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.428883041649	First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.
0.0	0.513394011129	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.316291261452	The world has changed.
0.0	0.356324768896	But you know what we did in Maryland?
0.0	0.284359259244	All right.
0.0	0.533320674732	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.62784308872	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.555708721377	There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out.
0.0	0.352823909265	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.543906458006	We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
0.0	0.550865552506	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.533678563253	You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes.
0.0	0.566254411851	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.547097146049	When those buildings came down, she was trapped in her building and I didn't hear from her over six hours.
0.0	0.300340226236	He does great.
0.0	0.510760476973	I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.
0.0	0.401770521994	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.299998076436	That is important.
0.0	0.386123901766	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.52621278319	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.277690198986	Right.
0.0	0.342276423837	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.620953034307	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.367571266375	Did she do a great job?
0.0	0.286316623896	in particular.
0.0	0.358105011513	So they put together this.

0.0	0.0	Go ahead.
0.0	0.423665071121	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.405814253663	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.

0.0	0.0	That's what he is.
0.0	0.374242386598	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.294037240599	Chris?
0.0	0.613825218762	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
1.0	0.551330659087	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.509461013864	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.582686803583	I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?
0.0	0.393796021042	The intelligence was by no means absolute.
0.0	0.359207230034	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.6041765984	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.528995541288	You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that.
0.0	0.497972645025	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.378537419494	Now, what does that mean?
0.0	0.375089743973	Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond...
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.468331736831	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.615384488418	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.481116993373	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.532075209569	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.384014142361	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.579271900206	So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.
0.0	0.368939982149	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.313288153571	It's a disaster.
0.0	0.361516563812	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.48589307795	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.494041189253	But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said.
0.0	0.540528078048	I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s.
0.0	0.328139449847	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.613689038168	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.420918568452	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.614745533341	Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico.
0.0	0.458591453415	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.381974194891	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.360882540484	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.53516913839	Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region.
0.0	0.365080028828	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
0.0	0.570539143137	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.362863042092	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.285220295861	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.466333320226	In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America.
0.0	0.309566788096	They're killing us.
0.0	0.465388512192	And, you know, I don't know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done.
0.0	0.5322109969	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.315800564309	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.367412420938	Could we have your support?
0.0	0.380947238845	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.375267380257	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.345626558195	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.36386510046	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.617181313468	And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears.
0.0	0.604806145026	And, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like Gadhafi, a despot with American blood on his hands, is overturned.
0.0	0.538808324882	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.477036273019	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.385012189301	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.451882005741	You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.
0.0	0.595024504794	And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.
0.0	0.393250916285	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.365442392689	We must anticipate these threats before they happen.
0.0	0.356484025066	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.569124034633	Some of the bravest people that I had the privilege of working with as secretary of state were our development professionals who went sometimes alone, sometimes with our military, into very dangerous places in Iraq, in Afghanistan, elsewhere.
0.0	0.518335118942	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.372151936441	There's never going do be perfect bill.
0.0	0.358243449121	We saw that in Egypt.
0.0	0.427568225829	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
0.0	0.301603692479	Break them up.
0.0	0.368420959844	I think there is a consensus.
0.0	0.385269770476	That's calling it what it is.
0.0	0.581111557491	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.363463227008	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.538840920798	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.618210515363	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.4253608445	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.40319774893	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.365452191762	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.547147959034	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
0.0	0.487709509414	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.347793035194	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.369128689701	My daughters went to college on a mountain of bills.
1.0	0.486964337253	$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work.
0.0	0.291477677808	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.540121282393	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.566918457605	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.543896920079	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.277690198986	Right.
0.0	0.380640232518	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.575544873952	Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us.
0.0	0.518378586111	It's Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.
0.0	0.45921467481	We have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information.
0.0	0.360785680055	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.423365717118	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.516207646297	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
0.0	0.461155801175	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.341228699116	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.304694363036	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.606394171797	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.534998991456	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.570070390575	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.616128286851	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.505928627652	Number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own.
0.0	0.3025892765	I think what is...
0.0	0.545036185702	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.606211065111	You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.
0.0	0.543960113137	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.296982484182	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.464276439117	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.54433072388	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.433726822035	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.552243341375	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.38645185117	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.549132310121	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.579472320152	I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.
0.0	0.38194175637	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.577448222097	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.618438816244	Why is it that we are spending per capita far, far more than Canada, which is 100 miles away from my door, that guarantees health care to all people?
0.0	0.542791573866	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.391594632238	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.580275480064	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.489202547293	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.615108304564	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
1.0	0.438520646559	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.555311965162	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
0.0	0.543982423077	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.584147813826	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.491552236503	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
0.0	0.362750041977	When I'm president, that will change.
0.0	0.355607729785	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.405330991746	Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.
0.0	0.334867230342	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?
0.0	0.34519312168	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.610417108781	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.35236507318	Ted can change his mind.
0.0	0.546889698774	I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.
0.0	0.362698432979	And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe.
0.0	0.360963677782	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.404589644235	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.567111000428	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.364287251123	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.361176113643	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.367717823075	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.393263589777	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.384425661409	... issues they have to respond to.
0.0	0.576182343264	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.519580495531	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.279264313907	...
0.0	0.40930118728	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.377441788283	And a lot of people are doing that.
0.0	0.375984486347	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.4065274499	We increased education funding by 37 percent.
0.0	0.478983535988	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.433048721244	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.354168666563	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.467104867125	We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists.
0.0	0.515505566177	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.553227283574	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.608793340746	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.599650533861	Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves.
0.0	0.543129315141	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.542109791753	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
0.0	0.368070338205	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.3025892765	They think they are.
0.0	0.540680955472	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.385956288911	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.361035838834	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.500172614783	Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS.
0.0	0.467378944954	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.546550258933	We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.
0.0	0.573030186853	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	1.0	That's true.
0.0	0.386077944312	I'm not using the lobbyists.
0.0	0.5418850591	We need -- we need somebody -- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.
0.0	0.623190543493	And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.380183881663	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.544718376104	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.558928196662	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.539852423551	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
0.0	0.279264313907	...
0.0	0.364614249456	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.582320392105	We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.
0.0	0.391978514053	You have all of these disastrous airports.
0.0	0.304013797986	No their not.
0.0	0.297338527086	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.357690057629	That's the good news.
0.0	0.608678830031	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.341568505065	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.378861792437	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.48721247638	And I was determined to do everything that I could to make VA health care the best in the world, to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending.
0.0	0.547318695055	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.477377492516	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.572236209961	And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave.
1.0	0.601756768713	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.297787281428	She said the truth.
0.0	0.493669908003	Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.
0.0	0.540259039126	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.50995464094	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.284771074992	Sure did.
0.0	0.426059216226	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.

0.0	0.385914081574	Terrorism in this country scares everyone.

0.0	0.368408277969	They're sending us not the right people.
0.0	0.476691193251	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.

0.0	0.385152219861	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.552403220223	You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now -- it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run.
0.0	0.603352050432	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.

0.0	0.302915170362	No vision at all.
0.0	0.304013797986	It's not.

0.0	0.488676035935	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.573632850018	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.494250923075	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.

0.0	0.534959793069	And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.
0.0	0.545141745837	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.567337687229	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.611151371202	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.489320333444	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	0.411481331924	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.36118711941	Well, I just want to quickly add...
0.0	0.403451354221	Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.
0.0	0.398252740114	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.58684175106	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.575786664329	We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.
0.0	0.54140249967	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.388498903372	It has too much economic power.
0.0	0.462393507815	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.
0.0	0.442265157927	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.545686870815	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.310373166371	They are ripping us.
0.0	0.432673486769	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.494809870037	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.485118808645	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.561157834067	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.30378567175	Then (inaudible)...
0.0	0.528364528626	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.368409247353	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.310573518748	Didn't just happen.
0.0	0.370946018996	That's what the political revolution is about.
0.0	0.618312840406	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.494332365663	In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
0.0	0.605114559722	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.609367193709	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.33802690943	I know how hard it is to build coalitions.
0.0	0.377444564062	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.467780099962	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.542424174244	That is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.
0.0	0.543114543429	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.365776061566	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.509038658533	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.372237543251	$5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.494229238292	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.613268592095	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.377361017253	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.334006538326	All of us want equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.406634862634	It is not because of the tax writeoff.
1.0	0.575293321209	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.485939156038	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.564888177199	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.37171979353	Let me get a chance to respond.
1.0	0.449588832577	Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.
0.0	0.543645183822	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
0.0	0.386786908041	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.579178340584	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.
0.0	0.368475391224	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.384657391275	I want immigration reform to pass.
0.0	0.536320151298	I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video.
0.0	0.459795493633	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.517022651535	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.333698838376	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.405025484892	... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.35757539807	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.368205308435	Fine, I'll take it.
0.0	0.55113460206	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.34370219047	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
1.0	0.449555460011	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.
0.0	0.612852629694	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.375436721547	It is a tragedy all over this country.
0.0	0.492953634641	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.502869520944	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.
0.0	0.404130225598	How do we do it?"
0.0	0.536189774441	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.466598148521	But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
0.0	0.29277422077	I like China.
0.0	0.372759396206	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.377735168082	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.505286204713	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.341411021411	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.384089522714	You know, the situation is this.
0.0	0.549126718754	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
0.0	0.488885930075	You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country.
0.0	0.377060786174	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.54729157392	And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years.
0.0	0.366135967941	It's what they call it.
0.0	0.466588327995	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.53720620278	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.536640620208	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.501780639556	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.545320203794	My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.
0.0	0.488989999274	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.359018400339	We listen to you and -- and then we act.
0.0	0.311157823291	You do legislation.
0.0	0.567568820348	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
1.0	0.401195978559	In the past he has called him weak.
1.0	0.599391360844	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.389398773647	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.402778265367	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
1.0	0.571333638761	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.374553270105	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.399457823943	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.627202337866	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.385472783949	I have a comprehensive, tough plan.
0.0	0.384554715079	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.505627067011	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.393949249999	That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
0.0	0.310814143852	I will do that.
0.0	0.363325189023	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.48881945138	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.
0.0	0.31127287383	It's Hillary Clinton.
1.0	0.563724666392	She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.
0.0	0.371660501573	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.635736956628	And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.
0.0	0.519687837437	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.550559241531	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.530229775459	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.532407125924	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.40360165999	So the total is $8,737,540,00.
0.0	0.363808367213	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
0.0	0.342786942078	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.339140660759	And some, I assume, are good people.
0.0	0.613135443905	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.356421736364	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.355603185157	I will not do that.
0.0	0.504608812532	Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint.
0.0	0.287952832167	Think about it.
0.0	0.574106762216	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.372423961341	... Chris, keep it coming...
1.0	0.567240359012	In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.
0.0	0.491632400961	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.536375047906	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.571208425826	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.391046924549	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.496712572321	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.531043674062	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.588405441585	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.517677574077	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.489880836883	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.529586378798	Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
0.0	0.296494814546	A step forward.
0.0	0.461099487618	And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion, this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us, and that we stand with them as they have stood with us.
0.0	0.528268316153	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.637323458958	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.
0.0	0.37127541897	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.492735980066	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.
0.0	0.356593090921	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.581361355407	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.572614355972	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.383049411727	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.576316652096	States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government.
0.0	0.502433960304	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.487429635345	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.566916727301	In terms of Wall Street, I respectfully disagree with you, madam secretary, in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth.
0.0	0.5425106471	Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer.
0.0	0.493671297723	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.625060205392	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.390162639598	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.51706405706	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
1.0	0.410152935287	And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
0.0	0.516296561223	And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in.
0.0	0.559979284605	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.583495097838	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.311758706054	to save a company.
0.0	0.335504251965	We say "we're gonna protect."
0.0	0.301633570617	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.538071444483	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.568572961378	As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country.
0.0	0.388244502136	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.604401489067	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.558604631259	And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.
0.0	0.511387278197	We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
0.0	0.478726876528	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.404463671054	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.578960716389	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.455210612318	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.428709059045	What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.
0.0	0.614316920424	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.303833091018	Washington is broken.
0.0	0.607810103029	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.393269840277	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.496015002681	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
1.0	0.542875443608	In 1988, I lost an election because I said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of America.
0.0	0.392831863015	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.456846281304	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
1.0	0.569856857539	And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.
0.0	0.580685349227	It's one of 15 strategic goals I've set out to make our country a better place by cutting these sort of deaths in half in the next five years.
1.0	0.358593420239	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.553597995563	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.554119635526	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.35508650052	They're not so stupid.
0.0	0.365392771212	And it's just not going to work.
0.0	0.585184718609	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.568571511187	We shouldn't have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time.

0.0	0.360619512906	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.569360625962	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.499530679775	And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians, who are also flying in that space.

0.0	0.511601599013	That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them.

0.0	0.57193426637	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
1.0	0.541458175861	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.

0.0	1.0	Of course, you would.
0.0	0.621459852576	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.546434601379	So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
0.0	0.385523079043	When did we beat Japan at anything?
0.0	0.360271660628	There are no simple solutions.

0.0	0.48738982799	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.376490931244	But it's a lot safer.
0.0	0.376210151505	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.
0.0	0.550799808108	And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion."
0.0	0.365863844071	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.371562674763	There's no way he launches 11 attack --

0.0	0.281839335251	Nobody.
0.0	0.307606146895	I'd consider it.

0.0	0.36026271589	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.359467033305	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.

0.0	0.539020945712	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.577652336566	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.

0.0	0.495468216444	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.

0.0	0.342504492286	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
0.0	0.512914101185	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.
0.0	0.537773643869	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.

0.0	0.382099749321	Find out what I said to Greenspan.
0.0	0.52110041024	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.55078820758	And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.
0.0	0.579406486063	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.

0.0	0.548484416202	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.295138689695	And God bless America.
0.0	0.359235129154	That's the secondary issue.
0.0	0.392175749398	So Hillary and I have a difference.
0.0	0.279264313907	...
0.0	0.538530797795	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.309456236255	I know, Bret.
0.0	0.364459234847	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.601798061641	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.356861702487	And I'm confident we can do that.
0.0	0.398794619422	And, yes, we are at war with those people.
0.0	0.48969433088	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.372485744465	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.380694390346	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.566337569938	But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks."
0.0	0.296367364003	We serve you.
0.0	0.560292280571	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.
0.0	0.599968092191	It wasn't the bill that I wanted, but yet it turned out to be one of the more significant pieces of veterans' legislation passed in recent history.
0.0	0.488151128908	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.539945348154	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.
0.0	0.405411771348	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.
0.0	0.550268828702	And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.
0.0	0.534791836915	If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration.
0.0	0.475686952272	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.540366057487	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.474247915573	And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.430150920787	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.354509820022	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.360703596791	Let's reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.608804869883	Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks -- between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance.
0.0	0.288583199978	And Martha...
0.0	0.465248716616	But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that.
0.0	0.543741651635	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.572274907496	I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
0.0	0.455047931398	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.374770192356	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.619652130145	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.457682630904	But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
0.0	0.498831037803	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.366291853826	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.541984456912	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.319299721316	I hope those are the issues we'll discuss.
0.0	0.504018820853	And it requires an entire world to come together, including in a very active way, the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.340905318044	I said, "I don't need it.
0.0	0.303492132013	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.564362901815	I guess the one I -- I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after Bin Laden.
0.0	0.593927871253	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.
0.0	0.555831316003	And all over New Hampshire, I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose.
0.0	0.586564765885	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.481328589281	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.378627620867	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.566892834769	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.619845727888	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.49042447333	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.612831250756	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.419321957633	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.365213681309	The bill would involve legalization.
0.0	0.545260649995	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
1.0	0.462798208205	Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion.
0.0	0.501259446421	I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.
0.0	0.470595505276	I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.

0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.434170736259	They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
0.0	0.509008925277	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.542697103353	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.400993491344	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.391407902419	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.464174917281	I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.357099618608	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.479882484469	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.515470327502	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.53848442096	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
0.0	0.598909898497	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.335363172874	I don't think it's gonna happen.
0.0	0.609598229479	Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down.
0.0	0.363726922967	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.356888045851	Let it be for everybody.
0.0	0.308798369652	What about hydroelectric power?
0.0	0.501091362379	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.364535915083	Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.47683621409	There is broad consensus, 92 percent in the most recently poll of Americans want gun safety measures...

0.0	0.552056482483	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.37505470941	Now, he's doing better.

0.0	0.615298500044	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.563928734896	And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't.
0.0	0.411231190963	Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS.

0.0	0.488853828316	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.577297957871	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.380202044702	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.52245831952	They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea.
0.0	0.460070416664	Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform.
0.0	0.38447490658	... we will secure the border...
0.0	0.612503794584	Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.
0.0	0.36269048518	They're never going to let it happen.
1.0	0.545391065947	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.464807879158	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.289312663863	We need money.
1.0	0.575673888452	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.475863974789	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.340640237694	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.491846398169	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.543297693738	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.518686089445	We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001.
1.0	0.585782564708	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.454333613518	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.574783626283	No, what I would say is this is look, I was the first of the three of us to call for America to accept the 65,000 refugees we were asked to accept.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.389709868454	People were shocked, Trump got it.
0.0	0.567378548274	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.38318501	We both made the identical promises.
0.0	0.30507208982	That is not right.
0.0	0.485640201807	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.348365599089	Two weeks later, the place was blown up.
0.0	0.614097706107	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.482153332784	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.547113523457	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
0.0	0.386892492936	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.378164840342	I'll give you another example.
0.0	0.338316016788	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.540751477415	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.
0.0	0.555402079905	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.57240918837	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.484384566248	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.345121076667	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
0.0	0.609873337394	Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.
0.0	0.394472055926	But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up.
0.0	0.35274166823	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.428020755929	All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.
0.0	0.379410528421	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.502386239783	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.383980876399	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.0	No, they shouldn't.
0.0	0.508950173778	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.356879860623	Yes, I'm getting...
0.0	0.48653916646	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.506642905193	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.425306494613	We will do very, very well, very, very well.
0.0	0.581664182957	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
0.0	0.556999458491	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.484632431568	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.545004791023	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.465657835747	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.360602133178	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.486205647176	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
1.0	0.383142825504	Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.
0.0	0.40644394367	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.489628070995	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
1.0	0.60748930015	And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money.
0.0	0.504127006702	And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.
0.0	0.388554225221	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.382535288883	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.567927637994	I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan.
0.0	0.333564307951	You get a lot of them that are overrated.
0.0	0.536861841451	First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.551325738799	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.382361145499	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.485780723177	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.614682163256	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.383497507463	And he is a proud American Muslim.
1.0	0.564145077397	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.589435747059	That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.
0.0	0.544637286221	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.514939238383	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.514019934668	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.60543004859	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.403767489149	You should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition.
0.0	0.5485097615	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
0.0	0.458376154411	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
1.0	0.411486714511	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.361255471164	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.585357540211	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.497965230803	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.403648409213	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.49162563616	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
0.0	0.573921284742	When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.
0.0	0.306389651902	You just want to...
0.0	0.560003799927	... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before.
0.0	0.371158928868	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.355912563398	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.547639828674	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.486853569252	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.343216259299	Number two, we had a really good plan.
1.0	0.466155458686	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
0.0	0.363848129167	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
0.0	0.529029525084	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.488671573274	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
0.0	0.622588537752	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
1.0	0.550530373066	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.489809436477	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.382771043204	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.36060122704	End -- end Common Core.
0.0	0.468414494114	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.574950693167	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.612938074499	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.512022521696	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.370903930592	You can go to opensecrets.org and check that.
0.0	0.333920622414	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.602084461088	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.385606734975	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.487268345988	And I think that's a mistake, and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways.
0.0	0.566359198737	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.30507208982	That's not right.
0.0	0.374451854742	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
0.0	0.510870926029	And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.
0.0	0.456106752583	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.570418739553	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.478965113755	Many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed.
0.0	0.47927093827	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.
0.0	0.356500946652	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.541037621585	Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.
0.0	0.347845465516	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.373223989762	We have three children, eight, five and one.
0.0	0.287377874283	Let me respond...
0.0	0.585268948791	And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.
0.0	0.387533829503	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.39843577643	I waited and I got the scars to show for it.
0.0	0.336336573392	I would not want to go to that point.
0.0	0.567910730899	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.
0.0	0.362080312081	You cannot grant amnesty.
0.0	0.489091819011	To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.
0.0	0.517694601871	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.293352960027	And you know what?
0.0	0.457520163526	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.389734971626	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.309107572442	We can do that.
0.0	0.386838299327	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.491361775273	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.508705730177	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.384609286563	They went to the DNC quietly.
0.0	0.505097720021	ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.
0.0	0.576643499442	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.375033830241	She never lived to see that.
0.0	0.495811338358	What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security, through the State Department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening.
1.0	0.429021402064	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.547063398901	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.296417047941	It is ISIS.
0.0	0.357042857761	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.562771983819	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.519375699315	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.542768133204	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
0.0	0.353245498508	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.539942657778	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.531935148613	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.354706662257	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.364647684241	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.515381970438	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.384739863481	Got to go to Haiti last year.
0.0	0.538322964548	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
0.0	0.544166361984	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.475775336312	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.365147508555	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.514881195032	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.38205745464	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.571707072789	But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything -- everything, they got away with it again.
0.0	0.578690788926	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.520854843137	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.608725302724	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.379156371689	It is not a barbed wire fence.
0.0	0.279264313907	...
0.0	0.593860657323	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.495346164739	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.57078663699	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.551755499265	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.291837453034	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.55351564262	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.
0.0	0.305613111389	That's my bill.
0.0	0.528148498489	He said, "Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."
0.0	0.52155192827	Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.
0.0	0.541548785561	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.291578908281	And guess what?
0.0	0.612919489848	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.0	And, we said no.
0.0	0.622519811312	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.550193891562	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
1.0	0.621904330176	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty, and we're the only country in the world -- virtually the only country that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.383513320963	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.614014226296	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.391159359747	And I said, "I know.
0.0	0.29572870707	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.508077715339	And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.
0.0	0.364122158106	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.

0.0	0.593232335197	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.574825195103	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.345045178669	I don't get any money from Wall Street.

0.0	0.573550590097	And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
0.0	0.375818523606	I will break up these banks.

1.0	0.59980791972	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.622782265657	If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences.
0.0	0.354345198092	So was I, John.

0.0	0.310316609777	We need sound money.
0.0	0.580314859033	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.344626128301	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.622396131442	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.352504853508	But we don't know.
0.0	0.350245740422	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.608842405269	Now the Libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge ISIS from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.
0.0	0.390094384344	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.426523157744	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.51532199744	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
0.0	0.376985470108	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.384279335206	Well, this whole issue concerns me.
0.0	0.320288912476	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.338846582123	I said, "They send it back?"
0.0	0.563766615836	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy.
0.0	0.395244930842	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.480688604107	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.472945625839	But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.
1.0	0.512270945765	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.608372569821	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.510969652364	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.373356844831	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.507449061425	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.539318908357	And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.
0.0	0.621694819076	After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the -- the donors and by the lobbyists -- and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero -- I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford.
0.0	0.556128200207	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.321873330746	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.617036851188	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.571351994291	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.399603269553	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.50130609385	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.35873741388	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.493618967791	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.
0.0	0.593464671076	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.548990570136	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.0	But...
0.0	0.492408897943	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.358353133643	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.379335887997	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.545918491138	Yes, this one falls under the category of, I have actually done this.
0.0	0.383244947998	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.295974495798	You really can't.
0.0	0.367220032675	And people are saying, "What's going on?
0.0	0.399387158568	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
0.0	0.430340953861	But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.
0.0	0.357488194727	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.294554968223	Really big league.
0.0	0.468460683536	We have more people in jail today than any other country on earth.
0.0	0.3839752354	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.574909173106	For over 200 years, America's light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again.
0.0	0.380631682421	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.6018451472	You're seeing cities like San Francisco, cities like Los Angeles doing it, and they are doing it well and workers are able to have more disposable income.
0.0	0.354553497053	He was a little teddy bear to me.
0.0	0.361347125114	You know, this is not easy work.
0.0	0.386377583755	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.457088484811	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.599125675614	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.578740603897	Well, David, I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country.
0.0	0.550591663821	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.536557913755	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.452707557602	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.607548352434	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.369046494708	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.469081382359	Hillary doesn't want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her.
1.0	0.610586800012	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
1.0	0.565742347484	We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
0.0	0.385991291103	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.597725756396	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.364101657065	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.570174369474	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.609485627197	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.31008482665	It's real estate.
0.0	0.390811048775	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.376281338912	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.307804839495	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.345959246261	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.496883320588	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.582293541663	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.607404114167	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.607016976079	I will find -- within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy.
0.0	0.306364073445	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.491254974865	I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work.
0.0	0.467759623678	How are we gonna -- how are we gonna go back and make it great again?
0.0	0.385373267638	Sit down with people like John Mccain.
0.0	0.537219099449	We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.
0.0	0.37310310975	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.36646157954	It was an investment bank.
0.0	0.60171540394	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.62853305356	It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English.
0.0	0.382797577251	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.579394136288	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.377185644858	No, I don't think so.
0.0	0.563811753901	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.577919008187	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.541524131989	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.360822652467	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.356329225359	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.394016559639	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.377758317943	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.288458996547	Media notwithstanding.
0.0	0.603495744762	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.352443585054	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.481373486099	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.503720869393	Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.
0.0	0.309118497768	That will change everything.
0.0	0.553108149236	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
0.0	0.519105168543	When you ran in 2000, you said that we needed federal robust regulations.
0.0	0.379029774816	Sadly, the American dream is dead.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.365383343131	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.51681212998	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.355207460235	And it isn't because I'm all that great.
0.0	0.46410018859	We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.
0.0	0.53915706142	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
1.0	0.547816343293	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.490801947866	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.53884451625	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.607791827103	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.614857059848	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.620857462603	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.54304460124	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.312830546076	How has it worked?
0.0	0.608888174714	For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check.
0.0	0.552255228127	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.360758966353	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.482683821284	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
0.0	0.457901131913	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.492237458648	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.343576180725	And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.569572066093	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.383774486194	Look what they did in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.388589349354	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.537669654191	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.424701979987	Because I've seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime.
0.0	0.37779430204	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.

0.0	0.50463792785	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.428224628019	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.479682791645	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.311337094217	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.371497928874	I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.389580809317	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.518389877012	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.567503771866	... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street.
0.0	0.539802726998	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.540609088546	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.380583181606	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.453097539923	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.374082609047	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.604390672927	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.592465471604	As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.
0.0	0.57897775695	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.546507262633	We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations.

0.0	0.0	OK...
0.0	0.600042508143	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
1.0	0.585639083831	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.

0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.303194577651	And so do I.
0.0	0.348125131217	And it will have effects in the private market.
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.355840949151	We need to stop that.

0.0	0.569500395188	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.
0.0	0.456889500373	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.408039834713	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.558545769258	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.509424659178	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.462081488465	And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.367305984698	And I think that's the false choice...
0.0	0.284359259244	All right.
0.0	0.606614656579	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.51446022619	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.549848816701	How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years.
0.0	0.583255081882	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.53311462948	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.491290576714	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.60678117641	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.328344113152	We want to build on it and fix it.
0.0	0.360763382581	Well, let's take it one at a time.
0.0	0.606954370441	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.593300600772	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.60638058237	I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.
0.0	0.628480528047	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.509370728842	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.597347736193	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.399772569947	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.288807794477	She did.
0.0	0.54861517291	We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.
0.0	0.38525693224	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.553069688162	More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows.
0.0	0.330769514082	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.49335500735	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.364927815724	So should the UK, so should France.
0.0	0.309622814494	That's the job.
0.0	0.552059617188	I've employed -- I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
0.0	0.367294921904	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.48649476533	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.570257686482	There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America.
0.0	0.390392579777	We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
0.0	0.357042330026	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.279264313907	...
0.0	0.462977662067	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.499974152022	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
0.0	0.576461234998	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.360876399354	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.577107116611	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.513528421216	Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.
0.0	0.492841053665	And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.
0.0	0.606154661549	But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here.
0.0	0.380179945183	This is a terribly complicated issue.
1.0	0.54136006773	The truth of the matter is, net immigration from Mexico last year was zero.
0.0	0.343181536313	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.373144111933	But he wasn't a cheerleader.
0.0	0.508528253583	Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
0.0	0.279264313907	...
1.0	0.339259887542	That's wrong.
0.0	0.385362886388	Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.610911389028	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	1.0	Of course not.
0.0	0.519090933553	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.356959787037	Yes, exactly, exactly.
0.0	0.534490296421	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.550750516678	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.377337758364	Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.
0.0	0.310316609777	We need sound money.
0.0	0.309766303652	And for good cause.
0.0	0.536747479364	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.391418887601	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.5239137669	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.356979197248	The list goes on because the differences are so stark.
0.0	0.499192992607	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.487553957297	My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.
0.0	0.57023488898	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.369106270912	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.521316265499	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.380050863219	I would like to see it updated.
0.0	0.37443469517	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.52728576727	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.359033611249	And here's what's going to happen.
0.0	0.30690494476	First of all...
0.0	0.303643674375	He's wrong.
0.0	0.513966398768	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.0	We have to do it.
0.0	0.401232988154	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.405749519107	We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.
0.0	0.549074251273	These are often very long- term kinds of investments that have to be made.
0.0	0.426036273549	He said, "You know, I make great product."
0.0	0.350900584127	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.46157867565	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.550144607829	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.529007767629	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.571627909919	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.595346042778	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.471038031619	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.302002601943	A brief response.
0.0	0.30874243843	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.582049590655	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.484728485174	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.341984985851	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.584819912457	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.403745501981	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.354192345813	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.46105352587	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.602868749547	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.358903245499	So Ford will come back.
0.0	0.45959603227	Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.557093162896	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.500227076417	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.490691798281	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.336865916665	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.279264313907	...
0.0	0.615168396213	Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.
0.0	0.547763717877	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.420282407794	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.400124774053	In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.536230432196	And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president.
0.0	0.393965997291	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.386681177616	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.558982633539	But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.
0.0	0.278148141974	I feel like...
0.0	0.395941649766	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.
0.0	0.540249240063	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.541543953327	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.547745464115	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.543440292268	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.512449812212	That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.538419063563	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.361093524162	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.404710654039	Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.
0.0	0.388798567017	Lehman Brothers was not a big bank.
0.0	0.384171875829	And we should be a welcoming nation.
0.0	0.516187217759	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
0.0	0.622846968404	It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.
0.0	0.620719815912	You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?
0.0	0.3025892765	I think that is...
0.0	0.519277708152	Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care.
0.0	0.539735223673	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.305537553523	I've faced it.
0.0	0.403643179263	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.355555808954	We were attacked from Afghanistan.
0.0	0.50272183323	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.540038469901	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
1.0	0.37773832939	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.379372295574	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.579295074532	And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.
0.0	0.35292445442	I don't want it.
0.0	0.531292688679	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.433099872635	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.390016712734	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.609863962563	I've had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say, I don't agree with you on everything, but I like what you do.
0.0	0.279264313907	...
0.0	0.513689151283	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.312444079263	They're a scam.
0.0	0.439153528939	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
0.0	0.355549906767	Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem.
0.0	0.365711304896	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.361255612687	I'm the only person...
0.0	0.544706861849	But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.
0.0	0.511964656879	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.404211646169	If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out.
0.0	0.479927967064	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.494125649745	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.538826296746	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.605037296892	And, you know, I do think it's important to do exactly what Senator Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about, and that they talk to each of us about.
0.0	0.358425289346	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.475314695583	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.529003571734	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.531211847969	But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you.

0.0	0.459659761629	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.343646633906	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.463905963697	One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy.
0.0	0.539470203201	But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.389202418673	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.534493443572	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.40481668632	I think it's important we put this in historic context.
0.0	0.350384605977	I have to tell you.
0.0	0.539935548818	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.473396608301	There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better.
0.0	0.492234742885	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.0	That's not true.
0.0	0.345663618417	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.436770467756	Millions coming out of school as you indicated, deeply in debt.
1.0	0.365118260197	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.55159189218	We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be -- we ought to send our surplus.
0.0	0.593970967622	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.607352611269	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.611536362918	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.379702513713	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.430661704741	If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune.
0.0	0.394123828818	Well, I'll tell you who is on my side.
0.0	0.537915866594	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.607695971656	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.491983590878	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.375901390778	When do we beat Mexico at the border?
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.40604839191	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.622083802924	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.287952832167	Think of it.
0.0	0.575657912067	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.477465886104	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.410307336963	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.528732398704	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.507983734568	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.457971589646	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.57518148183	Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.
0.0	0.355715879444	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.366538752711	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.364203882552	You don't hear it from anybody else.
0.0	0.570744650599	So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.
0.0	0.399681802311	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.544687543733	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.549200431181	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.376763366591	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.375441589112	Wall Street today has too much political power.
0.0	0.541271243871	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.6611340283	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.363858811876	We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
0.0	0.599110828212	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.535902483361	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.482920571012	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
0.0	0.371292943901	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.532719688816	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.277690198986	Right.
0.0	0.581282231465	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.516181927146	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.515046052403	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.599535404118	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.
0.0	0.544295592877	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.
0.0	0.374217559021	Because you realize that people depending on you.
0.0	0.385389460716	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.375213699042	I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.315511888487	I've prosecuted terrorists.
0.0	0.297198544629	They're not good.
0.0	0.578590765628	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.548861435436	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.
0.0	0.548481568295	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.607898741425	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
0.0	0.349130706896	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.361530631856	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
0.0	0.493593930905	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.28657214586	You're right.
0.0	0.434972403538	It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military.
0.0	0.328611882418	But you know what else they're anxious about?
0.0	0.504858418052	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.376438023981	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.615471608316	I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil.
0.0	0.394108185252	People have been paying it for years.
0.0	0.582746802699	Maybe now we can get it moving again so that we can upgrade it so that it does include all the tools and everything in our arsenal that we can use to try to work with our allies and our friends, come up with better intelligence.
0.0	0.291578908281	And guess what?
0.0	0.378838243632	I'm proud of my family.
0.0	0.36991360578	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
1.0	0.373347861197	It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.458756509333	If the United States does not lead, there is not another leader.
0.0	0.389775609499	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.380234233996	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.376681394468	Everybody's for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.433523625204	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.399247064528	It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.
0.0	0.537200544687	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.372424978105	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.506226068414	I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
0.0	0.381268610115	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.467788964339	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.350291369779	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.381223113506	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.463437489192	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.343488616951	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.485484696577	You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization.
0.0	0.464715336899	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.516803976386	I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart.
0.0	0.567805247726	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.438193699585	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
0.0	0.496110818479	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.389737149001	... and 85 percent of gun owners agree.
0.0	0.36736021926	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.556378257485	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.383640161131	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.312188326631	Well, I did.
0.0	0.606757241287	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.301544697375	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.293487122097	The answer is yes.
1.0	0.374600292475	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.379382600838	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.386519569824	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.540115243917	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.482699930837	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.431236054738	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.571467079499	And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process.
0.0	0.581289715191	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.537131818672	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.571762124228	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.530587040282	And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.
0.0	0.543746051787	We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt.
0.0	0.491672349877	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.486945108422	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.388958400188	What a brilliant idea that would be.
0.0	0.367067826124	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.520264121517	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.345501185581	They want American troops back in the Middle East.
0.0	0.432692622989	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.
0.0	0.54608069047	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.592018041723	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.511878812938	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.34691702707	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.391159520472	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.598919380646	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.355565711467	And here's the problem in this country right now.
0.0	0.585283001565	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.666284990183	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.542681227446	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.516113816279	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.386437192627	All of these are very difficult issues.
0.0	0.355791879024	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.605353946103	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.606583885797	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.
0.0	0.359843506298	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.384750442042	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.438243694202	There's no nation on earth that comes close to that number.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.378079135545	So it's unfair to say in total...
0.0	0.482185731393	We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.
0.0	0.425052759863	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.377590747665	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.384427446972	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.487214393935	I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.
0.0	0.549019930566	We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.
0.0	0.289763027987	I want security.
0.0	0.511737236676	Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense.
0.0	0.353991340096	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.605037628639	It'll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there's no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.
0.0	0.430194025232	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.477907014114	And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.
0.0	0.359495466482	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.409497709955	Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
0.0	0.344330535918	There's a big question mark on your head.
1.0	0.427539370567	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.595166796229	Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone.
1.0	0.583474806578	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.388183461502	It's not only a problem here.
1.0	0.60290673242	But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.
0.0	0.0	So what do we do?
0.0	0.440794380238	I also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down.
0.0	0.363875597161	We raised the minimum wage.
0.0	0.315403856666	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.381829504249	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.540276007671	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.546517779053	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.346042867661	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.338302511172	It will give hope to millions of young people.
0.0	0.340204651642	Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name.
0.0	0.494295761374	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.549821312428	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.382540010804	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.42951347594	The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world.
0.0	0.510713683614	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.294079777149	We got it.
0.0	0.608528330432	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.567668515252	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.35448952575	And I mean, are you kidding me?
1.0	0.627117848508	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.389746168131	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.60920801235	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.40383530726	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.577345352329	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.479926922348	I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary...
0.0	0.456676852002	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.357996798582	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.481915070814	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.

0.0	0.45682789101	See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together.
0.0	0.621770604091	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.473997295558	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.

0.0	0.366176793851	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.628366703105	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.360572037873	But the facts are simple.

0.0	0.381802162167	I have a problem with that, Martha.
0.0	0.581050131028	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.333229094993	We never dreamt we'd ever see it."
0.0	0.372017076183	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.632742730933	And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
0.0	0.313783406766	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.338590942797	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
0.0	0.390160069369	That could be the great Trojan Horse.

0.0	0.308290761168	He's very upset.
0.0	0.550028053572	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.304013797986	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.544971822468	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.300009519925	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.616518616246	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.360121525618	So the fact is that we work for the people.
0.0	0.309107572442	We can do that.
0.0	0.550063300476	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.580286009074	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.283761460781	You find me...
0.0	0.491903434404	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.56265739499	I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to -- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.
0.0	0.538871274761	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.408296799951	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
1.0	0.431611525822	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.492329755015	Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.
0.0	0.303849727849	Thank you, John.

0.0	0.561774407293	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.546736339922	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.
0.0	0.293890417647	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.302701549298	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.508580260014	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.602227254361	We now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act, and I don't think we should have to be defending it among Democrats.
1.0	0.341001950238	Very few children.
0.0	0.454544183359	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.327032024178	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.51921428244	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.57885288921	I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.503623607161	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.378093014142	And so, you go the extra mile.
0.0	0.308237230774	We actually did it.

0.0	0.389508966809	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.356446752612	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.

0.0	0.494330835722	Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
0.0	0.387404165928	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.573179061952	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.371092733175	May I respond to the critique on the ...
0.0	0.39418586202	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.347103610332	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.471969709427	So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do.
0.0	0.301516236927	I love the Saudis.

0.0	0.354221655787	I think this is a very difficult issue.
0.0	0.295656819869	...No, sir...
0.0	0.43225549159	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.431420642086	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.485205555922	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.359851487196	The threat is Islamic terrorism.

0.0	0.47897337892	Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.
0.0	0.380815944213	This issue is not about that anymore.

0.0	0.459994558816	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.490241902015	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.592711979838	So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.
0.0	0.606135638895	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.549467409358	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
0.0	0.359994573433	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.583357869348	Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.
0.0	0.419734673367	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.425685574097	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
1.0	0.520992071692	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.435278487889	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
1.0	0.483538585305	He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage, and what its effects are.
0.0	0.396759493722	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.46322308266	Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.
0.0	0.536635067151	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.544311085258	But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.
0.0	0.479245081123	Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, "Sorry, fellas.
0.0	0.366760891023	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.585880335332	We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
0.0	0.302131629494	Don't believe it.
0.0	0.573165945266	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.
0.0	0.547721493219	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.354930626622	Can I just say this...
0.0	0.354463110964	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.550056833822	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.540740081259	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
0.0	0.353631938375	We have people that have no incentive to work.
1.0	0.496550954054	The average middle-class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.484042349575	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.353824583325	But I was born here.
0.0	0.288807794477	That is...
0.0	0.548507035814	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.303236013055	We don't win.
0.0	0.546589564958	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
0.0	0.359048304123	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.622038542752	... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region.
0.0	0.578579640573	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.472186792888	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.546357331892	So I've said, if the big banks don't play by the rules, I will break them up.
0.0	0.564639677157	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.546474672044	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.371281298478	You just can't do it.
0.0	0.39996302131	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.359021290118	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.339656676196	John, may I -- may I interject here?
0.0	0.562392058901	This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along.
0.0	0.496503376163	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.551518864981	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.299841053154	That's for sure.
0.0	0.362503763664	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
0.0	0.575654044634	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.289261974279	We're friends.
0.0	0.468911974925	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.306311760538	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.3766394177	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.347198721156	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.469822080882	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.296888223088	That's fine.
0.0	0.510265681838	According to the economists -- who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying -- that $24 trillion -- we're very close -- that's the point of no return.
0.0	0.359889046081	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.376982408893	Kevin, if I could just jump in.
0.0	0.576408337077	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.600494716272	At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida.
0.0	0.426933446591	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.538930396451	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.3667128456	Martha, may I -- Martha, may I...
0.0	0.378762925108	That's a wonderful business model.
0.0	0.35223224198	And I think this is an important question.
1.0	0.45990599679	Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.
0.0	0.305967095833	He undermines it.
0.0	0.391159034327	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.350705294134	We have problems with Russia.
0.0	0.514214514059	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.610457180726	We need, basically, to pledge that we're going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.
0.0	0.475738207803	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.58616917717	My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.458147678906	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.
0.0	0.606122846764	When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it.
0.0	0.492203272105	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.503462142474	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.568760845423	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.58092880495	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.376672863434	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.490436912413	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.292384742294	Wait for what?
0.0	0.560931691064	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.376026251464	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.47787319291	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
1.0	0.54622094069	And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.293998845303	I'm ready.
0.0	0.391933778343	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.542169908698	I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones.
0.0	0.550126838416	My heart, like all of us in this room, John, and all the people across our country, my hearts go out to the people of France in this moment of loss.
0.0	0.288807794477	Do it.
0.0	0.362411093113	He couldn't answer the question.
0.0	0.551126848472	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.51325206832	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.344445861059	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.555294567347	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.614682163256	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.344703134501	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.424829435562	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.37048753961	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.492809234809	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.279264313907	...
0.0	0.279264313907	...
0.0	0.405102319932	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.574446235485	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.428587918166	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
0.0	0.616925604889	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.0	2,000?
0.0	0.384308949912	By actually doing more for education.
0.0	0.426526866182	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.543366409486	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.365275210727	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.397232156633	And before I say it, I have to say this.
0.0	0.541932495311	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.
0.0	0.385783292611	Martha -- I would just repeat that --
0.0	0.302107452514	I think you're --
0.0	0.610986351391	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.
0.0	0.435976015279	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.
0.0	0.367203339051	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.540934232337	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.547589285645	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
1.0	0.551595274089	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.539903035562	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.582637432449	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.363820683393	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.353180133032	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.358967037327	My patients are beside themselves.
0.0	0.543683913594	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.54753167863	You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.469768966212	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.475263453355	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.49790535257	As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe.
0.0	0.620163099628	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.39165140007	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.581984867074	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.547195237442	So what I had to do then is go back and start working on a bill that wasn't the bill that I wanted.
0.0	0.284242967086	Thousands.
0.0	0.311914902432	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.377273721651	It's interesting that Jeb mentions the book.
0.0	0.288807794477	I do.
0.0	0.374263517721	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.463061703311	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.357042330026	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.620535830098	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.370820178722	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.541229044176	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...
0.0	0.37541559419	The central question in this race is trust.
0.0	0.359565169047	And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous.
0.0	0.510369976986	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.38565937588	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.393152039081	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.283142929584	Neil?
0.0	0.614461786526	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.459217238541	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.374918936678	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.360805765075	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.593188701509	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.535806979667	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.572730644134	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.531055641738	We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.
0.0	0.431555305925	There are many crises that come -- a water crisis in Toledo.
0.0	0.30143510778	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.457617576733	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
1.0	0.6273543739	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.599806811442	We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up.
0.0	0.38645116447	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.384478419004	And we need the right people.
0.0	0.424172654534	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.457871321867	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.535664567552	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.360086717292	There must be some way.
0.0	0.566933488643	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.538033194852	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
0.0	0.502301263405	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.391471798535	People were just being fined to death.
0.0	0.420534978531	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.383747444294	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.468072448364	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.367969925789	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.543748946115	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.459745751016	Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.338965773655	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.401208944343	I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace.
0.0	0.54815484595	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.369093850433	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.382974821247	This group needs to be confronted and defeated.
0.0	0.388484795527	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.422010589104	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.4570951354	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.269192772757	Okay.
0.0	0.359665409195	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.506064100373	And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.612085310319	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.543924870977	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.60966267773	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.358111110287	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.309925561357	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.383612647673	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
1.0	0.420802902802	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.

0.0	0.289511910667	I...
0.0	0.372658112743	That makes no sense at all.
0.0	0.53708977734	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.581004332551	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.387333744546	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.298247494904	Check it out.
0.0	0.549658374119	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.340451060919	I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.
0.0	0.540252869863	I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out.
0.0	0.617962051465	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
1.0	0.5924838618	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.569073228623	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.507441911586	But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it.
0.0	0.577724495658	You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super PAC and they're advertising against me in Iowa as we speak.
0.0	0.455946463063	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.383675513815	Well, thanks for having me.
0.0	0.368667651873	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.474551794761	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.606508133852	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.551251115246	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.0	And...
0.0	0.460184270459	We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation.
0.0	0.499695872216	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.511242567604	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.546379580684	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
0.0	0.357952021537	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.429936746658	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.377783190116	But states need to do more as well.
0.0	0.509468952667	But I think it's the right road for us to try to travel.
0.0	0.369342280594	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
0.0	0.425774959802	Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.537806810366	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.490413717057	We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president.
0.0	0.48125158906	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.624793284385	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.518745401626	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.299045583758	...Chris...
1.0	0.619706572252	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.382027060623	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.464188101248	And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.
0.0	0.426501769348	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
0.0	0.403012047421	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.606145496431	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.58034631475	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.386913791321	But people have to be alert.
0.0	0.458980746468	They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe.
0.0	0.470585455409	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.357374970549	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.327929745519	That has not been...
0.0	0.487785781593	Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough.
0.0	0.389052872369	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.481488623915	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.394088228153	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.477724929038	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.601203657493	And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college.
0.0	0.320134778899	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.302138836968	Yes, I apologize.
0.0	0.598989435657	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.354658023772	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.358026706157	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.605781445365	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.622633932077	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
0.0	0.369007739205	We can in fact create jobs and provide job security.
0.0	0.564790271007	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.604943119258	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.304013797986	Not at all.
0.0	0.572883635118	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.585995692712	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.35740987225	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.510335095219	Well, I just think you're asking a question with a false choice.
0.0	0.359116890295	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.51337748584	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
0.0	0.560502510925	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.459076254138	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.35273186327	So I don't think...
0.0	0.530415757335	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.375004713766	They are not our friend, believe me.
0.0	0.568965211444	So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
0.0	0.611598282542	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.355006505925	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
0.0	0.539365126945	For a start, they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes.
0.0	0.462921237708	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.505342373362	That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.
0.0	0.353083578759	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.543961173547	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
0.0	0.380604208313	I mean, that's a fact.
0.0	0.487057358774	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
1.0	0.551905256999	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
0.0	0.350509215748	It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state.
0.0	0.586913291798	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.593175547509	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.535066853257	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.56934127466	If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs.
0.0	0.486754877447	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.529299880985	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.57077362079	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.542624174038	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.534238773571	Are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not?
0.0	0.534412787785	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.549930702794	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.503011086333	Why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want?
0.0	0.378800643054	We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is.
0.0	0.586369239702	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
0.0	0.559428491733	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.486057550785	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.356688736364	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.51734033845	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.365912987381	And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.
0.0	0.364018026284	Our vets have been abandoned.
0.0	0.485486917881	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.467962269002	If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship.
1.0	0.563011271001	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.473744424107	Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging.
0.0	0.557647248217	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.521211276038	I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place.
0.0	0.586465233446	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.422729524061	Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.
0.0	0.466448947489	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
1.0	0.408137567748	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.499232980794	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.360625958317	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.369735345244	Yeah, but let me respond...
0.0	0.366979217769	I said, "I gotta go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.543178459977	So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.
0.0	0.362215839053	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.379436466318	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.355314974394	How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
0.0	0.591970716657	And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.
0.0	0.316231636193	He has never defended...
0.0	0.543799294388	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.451209058425	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.611110309048	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
0.0	0.517622283024	I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal.
1.0	0.361306653364	We passed it after 9/11.
0.0	0.366015581469	This nation is the most powerful military in the world.
0.0	0.609415409327	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.313288153571	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.568223732718	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.0	Go ahead.
0.0	0.35728305351	That's off the table...
0.0	0.60237430739	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.61052065168	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.57931369288	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.373272734707	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.353189268022	I know the good ones.
0.0	0.40792527608	Could we loan you $4 billion"?
0.0	0.575778567023	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.50730552489	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.348008890179	We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq.
0.0	0.390577322845	That's who I'm indebted to.
0.0	0.516628848761	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
0.0	0.481702725249	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.573508759605	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.294735800456	Ninety-three hours.
0.0	0.489976965725	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.
0.0	0.383694508868	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.513444099524	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.652371247595	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.502737959621	My mother's dream -- and she died very young, but my mother's dream for her whole life was to be able to get out of that rent-controlled apartment and own a home of her own.
0.0	0.354811989717	That's what really matters.
0.0	0.303055204757	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.488962549585	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.628876126841	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.484687402134	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.504672636797	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.550001802625	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.
0.0	0.622940584112	What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years.
0.0	0.569459121297	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
1.0	0.571577346507	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.403988017787	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.478817954773	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.541835111213	The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.
0.0	0.522066530642	I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons.
0.0	0.354585051754	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.566446496895	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.405006565429	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
1.0	0.529766946418	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.366009262825	We have to come together as a country.
0.0	0.308666059025	Not assets."
0.0	0.384324614079	Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted.
0.0	0.568868523499	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.0	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.48411472887	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.62643307923	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
0.0	0.373330366549	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.582836439492	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.560287548522	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.35330387317	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.589994793045	You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.
0.0	0.399914484555	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.291837453034	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.375840703994	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.509210104819	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.384513797596	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.499978515693	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.374546618531	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.383039388751	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.566311742426	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
0.0	0.301200509122	Came out great.
0.0	0.491611027947	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.494790652465	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.549712952708	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.506174663132	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.413325356055	I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.408404486797	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.
0.0	0.544486805923	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.378165381264	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.535897556915	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.481807551118	As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
0.0	0.541413922052	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.599940478457	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.395689384044	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.507646236779	A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.
0.0	0.538247032638	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.312957098188	... first of all...
0.0	0.470897962695	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.371230736735	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.352369470968	We know about the Brits.
0.0	0.390359252044	We ended up with 56 votes.
0.0	0.53359960466	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.333197211727	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.376214363134	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.363485935884	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.57115597762	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.389503791255	We expand Medicare to all people.
0.0	0.601577552066	We haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.
0.0	0.567310635236	RADDATZ: OK. Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, right here at Saint Anselm college, Neil Levesque.
0.0	0.392444995536	And now they are beating us economically.
0.0	0.496218699003	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.289795866922	You get together.
0.0	0.386777306166	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.487861430054	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.362712240308	Our country is in crisis.
0.0	0.557430574905	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
0.0	0.399467639122	That's what I understand is the request from the international...
0.0	0.368889414894	I'm going to do it for America.
1.0	0.561093436965	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
0.0	0.472514734086	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
1.0	0.391893403453	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.607214579066	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.301018771803	Of course.
0.0	0.61827357769	We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear.
0.0	0.37364507854	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.474190753362	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.298160057674	Thank you, Marco.
0.0	0.288807794477	You do.
0.0	0.569758537285	Why do -- why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major -- the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?
0.0	0.454585958153	They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
0.0	0.572794365216	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.
0.0	0.328321075313	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.510566965245	So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly.
0.0	0.495478691933	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.430347739484	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.540832865524	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.395755190114	If I was president, I'd say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.395165240122	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.366186320641	They are not going to go away on their own.
0.0	0.373206631077	Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
0.0	0.647937913141	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.54232500362	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.311112855882	I need your help.
0.0	0.378328760996	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.661143319293	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.374367010458	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.352798968023	I hire people, they do a Web site.
0.0	0.355617305397	They're a great family.
0.0	0.405906854962	But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.
0.0	0.361980627636	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.402613105582	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
0.0	0.428229639784	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.41511099957	May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care?
0.0	0.397676900359	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.513549478255	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
1.0	0.302135141009	They stole it.
0.0	0.486815637245	Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable?
0.0	0.523069542824	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.584116941648	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
0.0	0.486646783973	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.341600281761	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.531978123397	Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty.
1.0	0.587358056336	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.497186545788	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.459047455471	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.365374401056	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.573885987884	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.508518847708	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.543103462176	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
1.0	0.643190181033	Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world.
0.0	0.39336091289	This ties into campaign finance reform.
0.0	0.619211185583	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.529389947067	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.34909084558	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.379503046568	I want security for this country.
1.0	0.642158070043	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.383585323705	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.379448266605	Well, they're glitches because...
0.0	0.300459451504	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.376116834356	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.290352321882	John.
0.0	0.494294032244	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.580616912548	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.360595666704	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.356017941731	... What was your question...
0.0	0.577537996426	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.355502487193	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.313864628883	They elected moderate leaders.
0.0	0.310814143852	But it will be...
0.0	0.35969377445	Planned Parenthood will be defunded.
0.0	0.378866854142	Nobody can do that like me.
0.0	0.611454498652	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.357480959232	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...
0.0	0.605499054486	But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
0.0	0.518483227157	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.502927744077	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.513022686846	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.598701708269	And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.
0.0	0.363619198388	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.350639078872	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.477930648345	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.30294914424	The answer is simple.
1.0	0.450169921725	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
1.0	0.385759862612	I did introduce legislation to reign in compensation.
0.0	0.342168256353	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.3376115135	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.539173648506	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.57419362493	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.
0.0	0.399718653435	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
0.0	0.460156368348	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.29540875338	On welfare.
0.0	0.0	I like it.
0.0	0.597214333756	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.544231319248	I was there in '89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.
0.0	0.497003240129	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.374504334066	I think that is the number one requirement.
0.0	0.363410891358	Many are in this building.
0.0	0.486714501338	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.605410622234	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.353164821358	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.512418491522	Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice.
0.0	0.463563796893	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.302560808172	Okay, thank you.
0.0	0.57106036602	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.
0.0	0.531361919514	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.35273186327	I don't think so.
0.0	0.594268628388	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.549879742394	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.543166208276	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.550528570529	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.383970347784	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.510199255207	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.363967364543	Can I -- can I -- I just...
0.0	0.541160713111	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.549638928664	There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan.
0.0	0.287418609817	Not good.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.595178529246	It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.47589273681	Please go to hillaryclinton.com and be part of making this country what we know it can and should be.
0.0	0.588629821762	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.
0.0	0.491511923242	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.
0.0	0.384066549771	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.611690477669	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.561347330405	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.539090931683	And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.
0.0	0.584927101862	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.333397621141	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.623814159801	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.545156194098	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.626564923998	So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.
1.0	0.407230658707	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.362970475476	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.398202523626	They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
0.0	0.560223144732	One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together.
0.0	0.338777229524	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.584388263034	The endorsements that I'm proud of are conservative leaders like Dr. James Dobson, and over 700,000 contributions nationwide, people going to our Web site, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.382615670962	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.375696297231	We've got to build a coalition abroad.
0.0	0.385278770944	We overcame the NRA's objections.
0.0	0.536958755717	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
1.0	0.4063954233	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.620178131577	We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States.
0.0	0.469376465495	We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.
0.0	0.543032174598	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.426660729382	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
1.0	0.520649820861	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.516821282935	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.332291070742	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.60666475657	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.384651195202	How are they going to beat ISIS?
0.0	0.51845145206	I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider.
0.0	0.545134389195	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.34537624715	Kathie, this was not merely theory in Maryland.

1.0	0.300859351349	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.386435926335	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.
0.0	0.513121036306	I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up.
0.0	0.0	Again...
0.0	0.361575622677	We offered a lot more.
0.0	0.359696652059	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.423540247797	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.540337717691	We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it.
0.0	0.485682978289	And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party, but of President Obama.
0.0	0.362530885716	First priority, destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.361093765351	We have people that don't have it.
0.0	0.475046413901	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.477962382074	Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title.
0.0	0.389074042255	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.378931442285	We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
0.0	0.403541115801	But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand.
0.0	0.554945144106	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.474989509234	And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.
0.0	0.465784278725	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.509806955095	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.615667511867	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.498012000575	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.542778958303	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.375044808638	It cannot solely be America's fight.
0.0	0.590550606395	And I'll tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign.
0.0	0.465160575081	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.50830279541	Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force.
0.0	0.574615640077	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.
0.0	0.578765435781	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.52306315072	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.385053511743	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.547655209569	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.465645004481	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.36555501536	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.400529546769	I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination.
0.0	0.550845263237	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.361686325158	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.572416384885	Now that Russia has joined us in the Security Council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago, now I think we can have those conversations.
0.0	0.612221212628	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
1.0	0.574091194902	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.540087952561	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.340481828149	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.

0.0	0.374605009234	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.369796685175	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.356522387485	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.433833231512	Yes, and it was the same one that President Obama made.
0.0	0.513163057769	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?
0.0	0.437699197165	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.54642530005	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.358595518269	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.310099128035	Believe me, folks.
0.0	0.577767284753	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.300882267296	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.528950666834	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
1.0	0.596758352568	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.375721963029	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.0	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.361630944374	And I've been there.
0.0	0.0	That's what it is.
0.0	0.367289512838	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.387422470792	We need to end minimal sentencing.
0.0	0.490123318995	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.578977251713	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
1.0	0.401948970002	A $5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.515139608183	We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?
0.0	0.37140745611	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.481877834648	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.375981902707	That's the future of banking in America.
0.0	0.617055480918	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.343755844676	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
0.0	0.382618584763	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.489865737957	If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.
0.0	0.348348309193	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.581074241319	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.429588462065	No interest," because I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.403204989453	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.576705729982	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.378324133868	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.545336602626	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.482221671407	From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made.
0.0	0.397636150123	When was the last time you heard China is killing us?
0.0	0.298434990819	That never works.
0.0	0.613400163912	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.607091098498	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.572049377216	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.615555266062	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.355327706122	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.424563706698	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.377952034488	But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.374111877162	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.457122888222	Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength.
0.0	0.567926745349	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.
0.0	0.387868356682	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.296420007959	That means everything.
0.0	0.343243551648	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.38131560852	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.478215495063	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.395612589191	So I would say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.448203796021	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.383281655865	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.303434295985	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.602126264788	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.383187535858	They will be our early warning signal.
0.0	0.595103075757	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
0.0	0.618335969191	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.359174782226	I want a job."
1.0	0.576418436186	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.580465181226	In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, "Donald, you don't have enough borrowings.
0.0	0.379024508835	They beat us all the time.
0.0	0.613218943069	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.47821066235	ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.
0.0	0.612159041496	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.378101797493	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.314698898852	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.600467679261	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.294131540892	White people?
0.0	0.349854421716	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.392537251191	We've enacted it in our state.
0.0	0.504231397722	In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.
0.0	0.481230659432	You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.
0.0	0.585108077751	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.473862636693	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.525509705246	And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth.
0.0	0.345304423661	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.494240672225	And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...
0.0	0.383947913181	You have a problem with ISIS.
0.0	0.379452752168	My oldest daughter's a teacher.
0.0	0.402252128166	It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible.

0.0	0.342703026901	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.
0.0	0.378196401706	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.589006037955	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.503256825858	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.375956791027	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.575750989531	And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.
0.0	0.354650668367	Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978.
0.0	0.36341935896	And we have -- and let me make this promise.

0.0	0.461158050714	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.621928366107	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.556491599785	Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president.
0.0	0.355404596022	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.427945096117	John, I would disagree with Secretary Clinton respectfully on this score.
0.0	0.376236239983	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.326102520255	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.621000655864	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.282906576251	Sorry.
0.0	0.53707100774	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.428668574766	David, there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees.
0.0	0.543192704399	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.365486174163	That would be a disaster for this country.
0.0	0.358196323827	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
1.0	0.592896423241	He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.
0.0	0.543161688348	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.49567526478	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.371516253605	This is not the type of campaign that we run.
0.0	0.408918372387	We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.
0.0	0.632241163914	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.488939863072	And that this world, with American leadership, can and must come together to destroy them.
1.0	0.445539724177	Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education.
0.0	0.613260002425	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.505169244926	More importantly, I want kids in Burlington, Vermont, or Baltimore, Maryland, who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade, who don't have a lot of money, whose parents -- like my parents -- may never have gone to college.
0.0	0.304013797986	So did you.
0.0	0.358932725847	Yes, they control them.
0.0	0.36123517506	Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.
0.0	0.468146013223	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.476630958817	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.593600055159	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.541100831175	I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department.
0.0	0.574567393571	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.

0.0	0.425642844483	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.547251704343	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.478097789087	But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college.
0.0	0.590519083331	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
1.0	0.612845800409	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.

0.0	0.484505052391	But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.
1.0	0.370189570869	We owe Japan more than that.
0.0	0.380137627784	I beat China all the time.

0.0	0.292519953994	Fact check me.
0.0	0.572040971038	But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America.

0.0	0.0	No, you weren't.
0.0	0.478503561477	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.

0.0	0.474741699429	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.384451887557	I think we all support that.
0.0	0.517281627992	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.

0.0	0.487964059218	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.427464059993	That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.
0.0	0.479160817817	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.

0.0	0.481000269536	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.611621897825	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.

0.0	0.604981662022	And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.
0.0	0.517817887695	And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending.
0.0	0.291041353168	We need security.

0.0	0.465821158644	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
0.0	0.385420517554	I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.514376477771	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.554332407652	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.510455869199	I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is.
0.0	1.0	It's true.
0.0	0.409281682041	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.493504748501	Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.
0.0	0.598183110867	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.357437308087	Martha, if I may...
0.0	0.512876628221	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.379240702138	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.601792167173	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.537495022441	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.
0.0	0.375936213518	I made it when I ran in 2008.
0.0	0.358535704336	But wait, I just want to say this Senator.
0.0	0.348701280091	We can have debt-free college in the United States.
0.0	0.496797955955	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.337220532633	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.359399761595	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.35757539807	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.269240499325	Becky --
0.0	0.585449249337	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.503328138766	Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes.
0.0	0.375479789721	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.382511032102	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.582670086332	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.461468793821	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.536449246658	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.39379955835	And, I will tell you, I love my life.
0.0	0.350903745259	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.426092277827	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.536937842491	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
1.0	0.607700175256	And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions.
0.0	0.437549421585	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.301682326471	They have no choice.
0.0	0.53965883149	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.386475397779	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.614483471608	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.617463267785	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.520291322904	I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs.
0.0	0.568806636089	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.424928705271	It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino.
0.0	0.604783444519	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.432302472282	I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.
0.0	0.346869256618	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.556583314439	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.308478389671	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.544729321491	I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.
1.0	0.576743157481	The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation.
0.0	0.544311650172	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.296975103199	It never happens.
0.0	0.536416647493	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.389890653354	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.470313754251	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.397651485275	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
1.0	0.35857993734	7 percent and 8 percent to go to college?
0.0	0.367958969894	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.404234400563	Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody.
0.0	0.622823897072	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.
0.0	0.5525120447	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.41408126535	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.389186457857	As a Catholic, that's what I want to do.
0.0	0.509720562371	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.337615057035	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.507847114327	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.570533474855	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.357083006135	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.517796932045	And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to.
0.0	0.359033611249	But here's what's going to happen:
1.0	0.565158847687	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
0.0	0.530895038582	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.345212184861	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.489787222127	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
0.0	0.357761805773	I think any parent would be so proud of them.
0.0	0.396585377241	But the United States is not the policeman of the world.
0.0	0.349031272612	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.371222548625	But it cannot be an American fight.
0.0	0.567161899024	But I'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya, you would be looking at Syria.
0.0	0.376088641931	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.565129467731	What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the Muslim nations in that region who are going to have to fight and defend their way of life.
0.0	0.458936733181	So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.
0.0	0.339783644227	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.
0.0	0.433025726377	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
1.0	0.444629623763	We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.357246772249	He was a great negotiator.
0.0	0.454212446923	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.
0.0	0.467206868818	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.490203204163	I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks.
0.0	0.35524313742	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.383960942605	Please reconsider, I'll say no.
0.0	0.525622994949	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.300299141467	He didn't know.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.575769583725	It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.
0.0	0.535869689686	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.518509619084	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.494212174719	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.560416942534	We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government.
0.0	0.327929745519	And here's why.
0.0	0.544990394617	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.392019209202	I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.403418628174	Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen?
0.0	0.373968814777	But it was also the cascading effects that followed that.
0.0	0.363823404168	She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.
0.0	0.549080746717	And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go.
0.0	0.513543460625	... and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.330190863256	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.358998183797	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.600471615098	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.611863469444	I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen.
0.0	0.348701643376	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.470793237973	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.394607481307	And remember the $5 billion Web site?
0.0	0.495213334964	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.541513307656	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.390501593013	No, Martha, I would not.
0.0	0.344529961723	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.38960029123	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.344846012874	And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people.
0.0	0.390613862017	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.507595979513	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.287423657119	We're dying.
0.0	0.378608671104	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.497229454204	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.453953101969	And it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer.
0.0	0.296600234697	Revolution never came.
0.0	0.303075153788	Martha, thank you.
0.0	0.603429678901	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.347366929087	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.610761466929	We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended.
0.0	0.383656281307	They're a mile away from here.
