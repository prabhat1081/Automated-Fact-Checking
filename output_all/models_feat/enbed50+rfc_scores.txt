0.0	0.0551420036999	And you know what?
1.0	0.999995318367	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.0347463850713	OK?
0.0	0.209881248743	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.039741337266	And guess what?
0.0	0.235893472236	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.202361891572	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.35316946382	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.156659140354	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.0752372079496	Well, I did.
0.0	0.5	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.225910004006	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.228535076514	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.665279394095	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.457447883891	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.421559555226	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.552545165697	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.459188875579	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.0781358044258	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.558636713846	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.0985599543776	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.282386129826	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.436825457645	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.0420843695435	You count on it.
0.0	0.041741139384	They're off to China.
0.0	0.211431892086	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.0114572230116	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.226772059529	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.403242005759	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.447257894349	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.476213876855	It will lead to even greater war in this world.

0.0	0.73775741228	We do.
0.0	0.358551178151	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.0694382025997	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.468939513164	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.479216246255	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.289536979568	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.0999474334425	We're running.
0.0	0.360829060147	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.366649737592	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.0444410467931	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.267945874184	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.130969627505	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.169812165943	The people aren't dumb.

0.0	0.175706389221	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.205531927242	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.346723634659	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.125627387054	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.221720192587	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.0439653595647	I changed that.

0.0	0.14872113681	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.136093683844	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.260840968661	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.35077502587	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.535802945672	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.323346189907	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.423903344183	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.106237259402	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.122616095832	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.48286801195	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.344669618773	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.0465606604321	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.491326468388	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.397936740849	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.332160447186	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.

0.0	0.436898737292	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.

0.0	0.269781680922	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.0771504083648	You're right.
0.0	0.365558896839	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.464279161215	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.539246371866	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.267899938206	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.304739528774	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.222590420201	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.532318373663	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.352581607857	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.309254192633	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.254983410816	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.183644111168	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.106837490633	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.454309054574	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.368237967913	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.464077851018	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.152822137401	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.218377157593	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.356204951277	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.327841295192	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.311271293561	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.225006948374	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.0353257250681	That's what we need.
0.0	0.192687193287	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.327571754665	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
1.0	0.399069559067	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.340407907217	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.0131612460292	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.49120695435	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.0808913561906	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.197008430754	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.38929013871	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.671881948768	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.431697197869	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.103169725451	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.478773409575	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.440703173895	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.388478591186	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.0443751729508	You can have him.
0.0	0.192597499714	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.161164745914	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.456310193525	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.11929386211	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.192693391833	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.259823307072	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.206995654383	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.271810923843	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.206190518878	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.12173897662	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.378569545417	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.486645675793	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.51967951619	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.294314833569	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.406328512723	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.5	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.274363434192	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.254128581354	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.45791159381	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.259591701507	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.595904733956	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.170648010401	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.00358853346282	Thank you.
0.0	0.0449222666689	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.199428397853	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.295932089521	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.240000665258	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.410882376622	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.255216131125	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.0698856721387	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.374711786246	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.271872528278	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.214336078921	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.201623825429	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.165124642923	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.0627251420812	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.427788647997	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.43940888878	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.295299751464	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.29211561353	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
1.0	0.988116661438	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.448503292286	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.380682821794	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.0907208203058	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.168716668805	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.0378004655588	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.418357420286	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.0506688202039	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.425120775507	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.594798063021	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.209126397324	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.203487169432	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.418764879936	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.329620912562	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.319901371137	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.333944195496	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.337411492736	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.42744508113	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.237551339349	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.417056472869	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.0913748779839	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.277457991607	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.589166212164	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.285983159061	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.309921006119	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.309344483686	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.328495860501	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.358214194681	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.345535575626	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.156141982243	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.429524822993	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.101159645188	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.263792746847	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.375389842441	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.390057888365	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.109098443613	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.335983765459	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.552141977473	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.

0.0	0.354806665373	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.350981153546	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.159899748553	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.423716077968	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.132443639953	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.330680421674	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.0789394353573	Right.
0.0	0.388264984725	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.438322953178	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.360441088656	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.153976523721	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.404467342887	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.0609800255796	I like it.
0.0	0.461599737699	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.563584030901	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.0317517665568	Check it out.
0.0	0.380517130434	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.19943826513	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.540957359551	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.520386960133	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.313954432497	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.381672484779	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.165562503547	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.602275392075	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.264957644035	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.425559982927	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.485072003868	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.0321971307832	We need a doer, not a talker.
1.0	0.999981458261	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.155815461533	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.357791866376	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.282883237737	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.317265688169	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.245169694203	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.412218423794	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.388146327814	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.334662627923	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.447540505708	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.0923931021797	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.242310813815	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.00358853346282	Thank you.
0.0	0.0508516802503	That's my bill.
0.0	0.228649225571	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.245008420169	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.276431721102	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.430077330428	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.078072293982	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.160935359784	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.395779550898	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.274044585922	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.235280020568	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
1.0	0.634908163654	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.257153136168	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.0155951515795	We haven't.
0.0	0.249742449851	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.406218783562	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.336096592542	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.342384221529	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.423262510539	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.465088558549	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.358679495874	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.251170278418	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.0784254031162	Ever.
0.0	0.013836509383	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.215778481765	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.372422368196	Now, let me just be clear, John.
1.0	0.511049204737	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.462884713156	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.73775741228	No -- no...
0.0	0.490724202971	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.256592781212	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.316946043494	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.27591422657	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.401303877981	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.167277103652	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.646293321273	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.0809201031873	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.569854064869	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.26928389283	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.474925951271	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.223533239299	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.188924126534	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.228607753562	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.286104656429	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.410798848053	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.486494046663	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.192488709981	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.456125362449	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.329995621028	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.0614668764751	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.194312892233	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.475722244459	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.450100488378	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.317116740086	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.425792113079	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.274215732964	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.267937299592	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.166418728641	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.420475858853	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.5	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.0669371440504	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.34081126026	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.297777175724	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.381246787319	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.228987551305	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.14095883681	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.41223705727	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.247236473136	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
1.0	0.999987357112	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.285930774521	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.287554863516	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.421621550323	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.221706835727	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.32334557031	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.365710560057	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.412614653194	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.14967558627	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.576780726711	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.0275108999515	Neil...
0.0	0.391797471463	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.5	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.373436455059	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.366784921246	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.442441404044	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.283842087819	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.375848695985	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.0295043404804	Here's the thing.
1.0	0.5	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.223287667825	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.306960575616	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.228879860276	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.424334078135	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.344344729917	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.134962956659	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.233204979528	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.15227091408	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.5074635724	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.486137772907	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.378408153761	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.347241233802	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.0535457697712	I got that.
0.0	0.167277103652	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.212386112039	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.338665929094	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.253195575653	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
1.0	0.993978732297	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
1.0	0.107677903101	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.463361608513	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.21304999753	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.282990596298	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.157254106475	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.0339428184002	You bet they do.
0.0	0.435825555024	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.438067718321	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.0470987801997	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.363277483248	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.301742708583	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.346590176735	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.455670595786	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.152866232383	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.309332586755	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.475827488572	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.305181269646	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.50933831354	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.21917638219	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.135027861037	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.597299163212	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.608317638403	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.327440842822	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.435521358102	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.264354307337	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.396423684796	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.423190241855	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.0813649006499	They don't like that.
0.0	0.73775741228	How about this?
0.0	0.359392929267	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.21713858969	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.40833508542	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.0235792844176	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.306263075461	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.315439450568	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.287098170855	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.318108075439	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.19774362244	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.132103197486	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.395465561551	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.29478880115	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.316609577775	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.113754710071	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.0768629095604	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.305662589352	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.444097414506	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.188569276866	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.262870447563	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.318845253048	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.5	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.

0.0	0.357871929277	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.546984500922	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.140974425725	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.

0.0	0.155757115758	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.320302526842	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.484717728275	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.604091651517	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.492255529229	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.678871845947	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.160488248861	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.

0.0	0.53152245588	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.362031857294	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.0191899396045	Yeah.
0.0	0.20301470658	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.455721032082	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.541569889009	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.144441777029	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.596374879301	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.46099134961	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.377142232229	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.5	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.255960257451	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.365463148118	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.5	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.249524669064	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.249294344989	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.340320950979	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.141572160721	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.423653144228	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
1.0	0.995981316525	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.107882951751	That's what I said.
0.0	0.378770516556	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.318518581501	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.00358853346282	Thank you.
0.0	0.291949369439	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.39669436811	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.385366018482	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.55896326117	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.0799681046484	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.491094631087	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.432045392172	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.68410561681	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
1.0	0.31094057038	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.399169165816	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.263757608775	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.314480685594	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.205510426028	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.438702809807	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.169429264329	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.215929937918	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.294942693334	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.00358853346282	Thank you.
0.0	0.0551420036999	And you know what?
0.0	0.378212756993	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.0742859119347	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.347003977687	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.203920946377	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.10609830888	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.180889284584	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.451829438155	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.197000120092	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.382516916054	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.0767493312487	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.346613811685	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.262271462365	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.437917760923	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.574855258085	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.313467140075	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.300670631533	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.302123740835	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.0417948636995	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.318016129824	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0321071002072	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.258171200255	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.162774732771	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.280576513695	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.32322543682	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.37056573653	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.261413803235	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.243903408187	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.22768565724	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.206982397101	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.0147862358551	It's a joke.
0.0	0.511878575074	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.0793519113227	Good at email.
0.0	0.220538959859	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.227139488172	I never said that.
0.0	0.492289966237	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
1.0	0.999999968489	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.0223729586078	I promise.
0.0	0.648969892474	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.393625416812	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.0612595068432	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.286230598	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.438135795575	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.328415547703	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.33479553973	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.291932784279	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.377020142516	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.0132850023095	Wait for what?
0.0	0.210681178835	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.381646390939	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.254165808319	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.176772099886	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.314804236577	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.237118820141	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.264154135116	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.50617900577	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.356155483512	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
1.0	0.999991796404	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.483163070172	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.321776396483	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.29249416072	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.114058053963	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.199596594082	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.236004760598	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.0840776867132	No, that's -- you're wrong.
1.0	0.992442045123	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.365031498832	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.449112029288	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.479929337051	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.145101598475	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.176886791336	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.226737824593	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.0128396336688	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.118948360823	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
1.0	0.97168291886	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.344682546972	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.123455473511	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.00748646704755	About Medicare?
0.0	0.313302312633	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.379351338214	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.296268540363	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.667752542877	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.290359426977	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.0225851063898	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.0691792994689	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.466659914093	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.1833858405	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.167604309613	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.153180773323	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.399598939145	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.462901540216	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.213586430353	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.27247646572	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.420005052145	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.127100726845	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.

0.0	0.0080794767059	No vision at all.
0.0	0.448183924011	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.

1.0	0.608544823187	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.292362007159	We're a country of laws, Bill.
1.0	0.996097073038	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.

0.0	0.246018416844	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.0981153508869	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.202940270564	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.0255742662102	I have no idea.
1.0	0.455091872962	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.255216131125	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.408687820521	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.132518790608	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.73775741228	No.
0.0	0.305333006847	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.315115276093	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.375779212235	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.353874907416	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.153563618679	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.277873471494	She sees her health insurance going up.
1.0	0.617923812551	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.121323081117	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.360863017548	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.364500328129	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.73775741228	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.194663980435	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
1.0	0.987852972074	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.297342046532	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.184321714054	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.614365212179	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.271413727678	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.345612621466	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
1.0	0.506056801106	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.11242559785	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.410846532656	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.321954475409	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
1.0	0.995126685505	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.509732922442	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.0870539524032	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.360183011294	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.408745269701	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.453074560156	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.178578972071	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.73775741228	No.
0.0	0.223101595568	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.544814653085	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.471490999765	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.57035474671	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.21733060149	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.37585179904	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.222831501504	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.0550835770464	Do we have answer for that?
1.0	0.661036166522	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.451599157382	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.392069112184	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.73775741228	No.
0.0	0.306227032291	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.394637366963	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.570553753842	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.73775741228	...
0.0	0.509334606475	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.73775741228	No.
0.0	0.0899913519734	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.160136430379	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.407263108273	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.125445821231	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.357561023251	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.172891426686	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.311108709153	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.273770169569	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.445384612838	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.378867652493	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.254809780741	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.337825915953	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.649342707342	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.251271334514	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.223296167919	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.302330494258	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.339869465474	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.240599341253	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.0808414394419	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.247582510244	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.125445821231	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.227413727204	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.159665201526	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.572340640731	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.579346959715	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.416271609877	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.0615108943774	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.06639218108	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.572428806116	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.0260466338255	I would change them.
0.0	0.0153224940514	John.
0.0	0.288902586482	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.521826168167	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.474349253075	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.080770402678	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.0382420346394	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.321160006762	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.438314141101	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.278668619478	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.240408281375	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.258611359496	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.130522862838	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.181786624255	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.348490022339	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.115441123769	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.140869891298	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.275345623272	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.287652690565	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.208871886931	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.0408019741669	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.251826514143	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.196913274169	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.230356102807	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.167254331942	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.304098874314	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.226747802639	Two points.
0.0	0.370639383393	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.423396233152	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.119156938982	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.168283140701	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.0401038408766	Okay.
0.0	0.171554406431	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.25381923581	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.283696328874	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.513474747997	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.397753082385	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.256449970271	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.162265338732	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.102192217333	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
1.0	0.995768401313	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.336240086984	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.257808886949	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.252534168584	I would just say that...
0.0	0.434944097768	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.

0.0	0.126221469187	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.191787321689	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.0739069794753	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.277586357002	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.59713938689	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.198488812567	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.34218587908	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.226644873744	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.422985749337	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.172773478068	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.341852711593	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.544554214812	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.395656078364	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.

0.0	0.332152828019	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.334543526635	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.421732686203	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.133792764412	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.261448528973	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.218620517837	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.172808168019	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.55951600682	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.517861634628	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.306213863897	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.292577814691	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.30265435061	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.

0.0	0.251685592248	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.242128438936	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
1.0	0.991488472469	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.314123254563	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.313251995528	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.265670856001	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.271178066465	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.277601792549	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.119092569081	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.455995355541	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.73775741228	And...
1.0	0.984291470101	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.202642055555	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.207084474682	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.370072248125	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.5	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.382373797794	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.439716229083	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.337409124105	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.189708904993	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.101173831174	I'll say this.
0.0	0.161847567124	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.0982989647276	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.339393955048	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
1.0	0.414564250675	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.0113634697668	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.208814598015	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.176749650687	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.405171109895	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.402844616894	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.256679903054	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.422197509426	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.396313669561	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.214120026552	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.331472676957	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.0598523923195	We were wrong.
0.0	0.64099877263	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.459884051376	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.0722671201495	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.031376627616	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.42683357118	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.378791598486	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.52929070265	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.399517136176	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.386227836735	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.0813649006499	I don't like that.
0.0	0.410878684174	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.432763060781	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.191588397419	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.161930674482	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.284647760326	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.372266081989	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.191006457087	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.294251433092	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.281233405592	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.413661452952	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.0634938976505	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.405087062423	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.155813792871	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.381540986944	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.348119541466	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.380809464841	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.222602786822	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.413325693908	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.207840852417	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.421193323862	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.164743595904	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.157958435589	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.183890031791	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.519341354544	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.42375786542	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.480824481237	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.27577256761	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
1.0	0.544214350459	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.0744894996626	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.259657999739	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.146895694444	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.313862323904	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.343019349019	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.357744677864	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.73775741228	I have.
0.0	0.366024436636	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.0771666180085	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.449538667843	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.307551411053	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.507982887783	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.5	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..

0.0	0.32803641863	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.165496656579	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.135178481691	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.531503881048	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.183282141592	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.0395437481665	I think you're --
0.0	0.380638284993	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.134628174749	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.0158832243035	But I was born here.
0.0	0.494985732274	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.343288550216	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.533947523341	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.527259617895	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.440971487164	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.420756881005	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.162637699006	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.215840804818	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.371233329337	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.137246472574	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.17851191609	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.191576497076	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.184707828344	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.386506399923	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.479584528961	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.371925260633	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.223133238806	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.43369705962	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.393782707011	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.165818219137	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.112698091105	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.346102795238	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.356756833494	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.042059165841	He was on the board.
0.0	0.2018239145	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.34798069353	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.00876771155817	Dynamically.
0.0	0.137020673504	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.600163912701	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.25028145603	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.5	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.402902819944	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.162819859351	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.52226681579	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.225629324759	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.390606849448	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.227458225983	White people?
0.0	0.621263728181	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.368265994937	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.432305982308	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.199588044599	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.192402727012	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.265995556846	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.0081609852036	...No, sir...
0.0	0.0363604623032	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.355342469039	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
1.0	0.996726481054	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.339699165857	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.477865408362	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.283387034988	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.0863033347528	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.3919290976	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.249894317071	The number of women --
0.0	0.201917417255	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.29696471661	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.236487924904	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.290697497664	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.585801996024	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.0551420036999	You know why?
0.0	0.530507098416	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.0298385962558	That is important.
0.0	0.0379090133136	That's the difference.
0.0	0.0146200042227	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.21709229431	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.253264303745	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.333719901202	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.465013278456	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.251212982926	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
1.0	0.993508287751	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.434864603408	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.35630972112	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.440101623155	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.0592728024434	Both served.
0.0	0.230414868853	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.0283169720566	You do legislation.
0.0	0.508354129081	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.401458690793	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.386988843676	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.274135206876	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.41898856503	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.125565480774	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.276347870044	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.158982634973	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.467457898393	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.469359340005	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.249142536189	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.160935359784	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.259766928224	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.0671352407238	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.445189299207	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.285169015184	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.619859383709	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.256562901408	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.165022017837	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.119406088078	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.571336408866	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.510898973944	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.217855357573	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.287972868059	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.59552224293	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.105262906966	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.345129759783	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.261058579452	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.321494563793	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.223972183493	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.194102489324	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.73775741228	No.
0.0	0.0616558782508	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.120396221014	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.487309840216	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.250159351672	You know why three?
0.0	0.427877544579	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.102250375334	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.426728422711	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.248903727246	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.139351744589	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.301739822826	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.304795594316	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
1.0	0.197340358522	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.228613558142	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.302845171601	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.403087690931	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.187936307982	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.198852684057	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.183368430243	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.201173263699	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
1.0	0.488599869517	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.283814623049	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.083401018574	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.232874214758	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.263824806415	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.247704639406	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.120688285305	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.494940717331	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.161059342125	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.614857790028	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.198222525579	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.5	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.274562255181	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.454626108509	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.318313747771	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.508103521655	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
1.0	0.994898357292	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.0900896634342	Big difference.
0.0	0.5	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.418034884852	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.0593882862393	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.614358855299	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.377417589227	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.609455969715	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.268282447459	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.243265017011	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.465335801198	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.27591422657	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.131628330455	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
1.0	0.985477710025	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.5	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.149821500582	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.28326908332	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.528311874458	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.271014713921	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.40798245169	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.00358853346282	Thank you.
0.0	0.381382029356	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.107872158681	That's not the role of the government.
1.0	0.411048407503	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.431968128866	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.546622721034	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.302267540764	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.0580325635119	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.0819036343438	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.457597884422	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.382328980599	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.135327420365	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.288203979678	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.482568783323	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.394169488257	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.054910288584	Absolutely.
0.0	0.386741321096	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.130529236627	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.378409134853	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.365643213982	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.00572908464107	Maria...
0.0	0.200215805394	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.5	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.347213660682	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.0942410242231	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.0789394353573	Right.
0.0	0.230345328697	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.249476450326	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.479676187997	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.287700321764	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.215176727018	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.5	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.366838948268	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.230289090288	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
1.0	0.982324008556	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.0152217036168	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.179380499935	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.156581823705	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.00837179874831	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.487461381251	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.313302312633	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.511301848381	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.155727159771	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.457333334976	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.213878640878	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.385866342473	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.292427270219	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.329871324356	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.0959297807157	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.196854655139	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.0306752667165	Alright.
0.0	0.439789936876	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.207084474682	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.5	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.240599341253	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.289261103876	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.198174572079	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.380689262364	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.333219607576	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.73775741228	And here's why.
0.0	0.0826000106302	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.664944652785	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.0584837611544	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.207090470737	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.244643055545	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.0388970883959	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.129196234629	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.278034411655	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.388763903445	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.243456895785	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.209074115923	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.0648504208051	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.350082194506	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.0302899959111	I will do that.
0.0	0.318016129824	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.131371605003	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.343827079781	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.428399912855	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.143574065187	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.45398354783	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.213937910215	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.351234058919	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.236834319263	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.246209406467	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.0516631291251	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.634136365795	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.264080815902	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.229974197542	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.170186802463	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.38083913515	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.215834513356	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.419248300004	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.172718263442	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.542819902043	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.26259117009	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.215470838051	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.682224723718	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.256964316802	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.207018030652	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.00334218806162	And we are not England.
0.0	0.112996052112	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.25435533929	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.1186961788	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.511682248211	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.469551463726	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.73775741228	...
0.0	0.0806535449689	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.120126427978	A brief response.
0.0	0.358672965731	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.0548991959737	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.466346432691	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.438091766359	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.400050518355	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.462914521259	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.434526505784	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.578883335651	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.309393878604	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.330998741769	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.333093352694	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.293656991318	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.0231045951304	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.384338915457	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.298057265984	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.273312586086	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.404758944183	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.192772147424	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.0334837068962	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.442418739765	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
1.0	0.988496130417	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.62153606369	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.163237054216	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.338071986248	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.0598523923195	He's wrong.
0.0	0.706780047241	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.00141919042987	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.339839077143	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.288304679267	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.184028286612	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.492696297779	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.384674326025	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.448273085795	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.227139488172	I never said that.
0.0	0.5	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.462013186426	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.73775741228	Again...
0.0	0.16142819933	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.405384220802	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.452250708298	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.5	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.313575074066	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.205952606382	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.479407941927	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.296279426122	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.579284188382	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.46426044153	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.194307634467	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.5	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.371417719608	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.0637675656448	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.145564895536	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.012656388848	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.485297418852	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.288178845905	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.474942402304	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.277832735623	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.392077590102	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.304985011376	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.268916816934	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.0828465617497	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.135840567358	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.157839993015	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.296026848486	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.633264553903	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.173843521162	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.365271781375	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.25926379268	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.0443751729508	I can.
0.0	0.375150931151	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.553552952902	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.177089153814	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.102535977856	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.482250895662	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.342728077683	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.45269352877	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.224049001076	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.222729257372	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
1.0	0.997262553813	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.387092104188	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.240054184448	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.39752016363	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.320955377692	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.309778225676	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.272262734155	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.255603121884	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.545328720444	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.282739145156	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.330259962518	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.446030256825	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.437047728498	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.11348554809	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.401772881857	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.314166226976	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.522540780862	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.304907339482	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.581883684074	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.35272161817	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.265321976975	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.348421686777	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.177698100547	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.372744138313	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.350032025647	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.191114182128	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.395955944256	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.364476050442	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.529976579168	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.373571767328	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.477157610777	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.341359861592	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.385757982671	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.138141802385	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.490909028935	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.0708047107608	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.51263935131	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.414946253057	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.430130004138	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.190472980193	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.287319193179	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.330170606845	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.320334104812	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.276610916809	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.418765629489	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.321994875314	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.514012341849	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.0201620653522	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.258763438483	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.231183613468	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.0788661990033	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.402730945883	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.538632382276	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.31916611427	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.576483412066	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.140345954047	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.144273733612	It's a problem all over the world.

0.0	0.0772361523067	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.440956094386	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.

0.0	0.284940941118	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.2223066664	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.380707920714	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...

0.0	0.0548331755103	...before I go.
0.0	0.272700311174	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.469359340005	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.17035209855	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.306895152471	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.259356302794	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.370246738985	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.20556242075	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.531361017265	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.354214443134	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.0678955707559	I agree with my colleagues.

0.0	0.247934987792	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.0551420036999	And you know what?
1.0	0.637858092379	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.189722237018	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.319258731083	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.386357647846	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.35712081889	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.230741603587	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.445441785212	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.0725695335377	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.0935832535018	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.103553540694	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.331056348241	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.259080426193	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.162898924522	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.463510043534	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.216809379503	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.494526809715	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.394003268746	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.244525636568	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.461787207834	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.378162328293	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.354693540237	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.485523990657	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.231499007913	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.552482251459	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
1.0	0.999991159803	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.429002358508	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.442225364971	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.307516369414	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.563063540486	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.160036044553	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.433620589975	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.186575521644	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.385932349364	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
1.0	0.561857833227	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.5	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.434515431035	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.288521206204	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.

0.0	0.320852503149	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.427185425773	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
1.0	0.988507657709	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.

0.0	0.0155951515795	You don't have to.
0.0	0.0769669190725	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.454862384927	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.0789394353573	Right.
0.0	0.529124787093	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.252700713247	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.19774362244	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.477333127821	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.

0.0	0.0918091296973	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.334552097143	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.0849031432463	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.245163935854	That never works.
0.0	0.17648116431	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.572093649364	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.0291849624697	What's crony capitalism?
1.0	0.992668997304	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.34287802819	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.

0.0	0.373805367936	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.456877383917	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.

0.0	0.459747735428	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.442257323153	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.176182962487	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.317967400736	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.490778280888	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.0601563835731	Not bad.
0.0	0.309081573639	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.288686042506	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.182201563411	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.

0.0	0.344241875632	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.296878513724	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.378235878611	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.130169013266	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.0874722112607	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.0594220640924	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.404546243767	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
1.0	0.983458612126	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.374997536908	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.434864603408	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.

0.0	0.328654273029	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.380906774392	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.477551077623	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.144544033373	That's what I've always stood for.

0.0	0.086739618539	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.531546031712	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.253328088702	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0443751729508	I can do that.
0.0	0.618949776372	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.394551410533	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.

0.0	0.181675975377	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.424066801709	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.0432357078536	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.474901566463	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.212354033988	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.396788280788	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.0148679313375	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.474248061151	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.

0.0	0.24010596705	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.0207013737693	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.40353701964	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.399183255436	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.

0.0	0.256964316802	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
1.0	0.972504589922	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.279973084978	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.550153767799	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.123790662671	My background is different.
0.0	0.356677979015	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.

0.0	0.395956617098	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --

0.0	0.204517615515	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.316424269306	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.0347463850713	OK?
0.0	0.191329433032	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.261403049988	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.383103823637	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.422526747034	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.430584549471	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.463351868398	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.0771504083648	You're right.
0.0	0.664763486331	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.0207013737693	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.465286161009	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.441311865175	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.111463036218	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.127985051365	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
1.0	0.696432818352	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.038315937839	See?
0.0	0.141442595531	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.190608409805	The economy was really booming.

0.0	0.491826918056	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.386201189799	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.266337674479	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.054910288584	Absolutely.
0.0	0.137418770905	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.263644327945	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.386916161257	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.191631101322	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.566709285565	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.179952867776	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.285670769263	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.388872251522	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.171091242309	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.410788210672	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.276204186918	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.361776229222	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.23085450555	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.28384720702	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.382694223361	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.518643081883	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.0648915897927	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.232092016079	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
1.0	0.983591930053	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.419724833874	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.378982966713	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.553336129811	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.494351340126	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.417573749659	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.141114749355	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.609448292259	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.07147305962	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.297190911914	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.471483125164	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.348190193756	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.0866308867648	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.0265447284131	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.0850549573845	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.289070381391	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.345125692944	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.0521348621512	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.457241021663	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.341067683512	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.391683357097	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.224056956712	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.211249071034	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.73775741228	You do.
0.0	0.338990221855	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.341091804014	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.172419810139	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.438001639089	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.312644351409	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.218608876057	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.224436334266	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.0551420036999	So you know what?
0.0	0.285243191446	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.425465648677	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.390901152437	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.185945074339	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.00868075870288	He undermines it.
0.0	0.23689983314	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.0101582578522	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.5	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.35880721099	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.488781452471	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.395165815456	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.278028962476	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.194968556457	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.355332910898	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.537235299717	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.253731750096	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.356263787646	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.432885294243	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.120656971468	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.420768090426	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.357004161138	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.405063908429	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.250612851054	He has never defended...
0.0	0.397689292198	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.101518597654	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.129353250393	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.161681185032	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
1.0	0.986443621954	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.249532939368	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.313146768598	Just for the record.
0.0	0.289291239899	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.346389243016	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
1.0	0.37982965663	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.00358853346282	Thank you.
0.0	0.269243120591	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.398969508484	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
1.0	0.991158299385	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.467200033768	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.

0.0	0.311766147566	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.478934335347	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.

0.0	0.0323638816278	Think about it.
0.0	0.474420760478	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.348980136681	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.

0.0	0.336865155374	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.214443970019	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.551714114307	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.288013331856	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.018342543969	That's my view.
0.0	0.320958953905	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.131357440994	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.439065772211	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.105148528844	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.116701240341	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.377349037718	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.0551420036999	How do I know this?
0.0	0.0743236238251	My point is this.
0.0	0.282386129826	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.223813082561	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.602715202503	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.0661876248512	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.345757978314	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.0891681191611	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.266193927381	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.

0.0	0.220274279017	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.347150782718	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.300204175705	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.332558791579	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.

0.0	0.346989764012	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.0413679777344	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.439539106764	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.258660003281	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.

0.0	0.73775741228	No, no.
0.0	0.203255138634	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
1.0	0.57031005005	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
1.0	0.995286472718	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.197301016782	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.294413941593	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.

0.0	0.334247983913	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.447052298943	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.229039063408	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.369807848238	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.291326589491	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.259532273303	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.

0.0	0.553716137861	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.414541068335	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.453860908182	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.165184762797	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.00358853346282	Thank you.
0.0	0.113566523707	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.317709954998	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.120688825591	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.332152828019	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.387872873094	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.35879149194	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.214039110007	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.418033964158	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.276699271594	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.20934562679	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.573867028754	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.23351564298	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.0233155070435	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.351202366399	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.255558980154	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.59417974517	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.0347463850713	OK?
0.0	0.27335296636	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.0805560446893	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.179177915463	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.349799587219	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.00673725767805	Divide that out.
0.0	0.279756695163	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.303865173442	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.182119782245	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.314507125535	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.231589340667	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.312188277141	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.493255953669	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.140688820778	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.317175750839	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.0188331258024	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.300616091642	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.549820812055	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.257952764655	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.22349861014	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.342390847705	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.258530852802	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.417192568856	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.133240848309	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.384925534175	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.0785632585243	I totally get that.
0.0	0.10426141284	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.427344601609	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.395193073441	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.260460846537	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.333585666368	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.423605809234	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.114770526708	In all due respect...
0.0	0.415380172976	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.413528048495	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.216887118874	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.257466317366	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.351667023318	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.139094076282	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.606177353449	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.34365574714	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.0949888530415	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.0605683542688	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.336473114586	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.52221492523	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.305295721555	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.492781101573	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.124550036618	We don't win.
0.0	0.399311906023	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.104596495764	And for good cause.
0.0	0.212269707628	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.064832005427	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.357775271403	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.221695774445	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.266528876671	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.160193523995	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.370384537918	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.189384652224	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.301243616903	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.457509100967	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.480284455415	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.0662810686908	She voted for it.
0.0	0.0373915511229	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.0551420036999	They know.
0.0	0.220878252407	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.544827673976	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.0299993405464	You find me...
0.0	0.0730306530208	Illegal.
0.0	0.434072863725	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.414463177959	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.343244942727	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.301542975203	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.367447568294	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.120111448331	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.0452404039666	That's fine.
0.0	0.45872151618	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.303924173985	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.253280978913	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.211897082996	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.161411329523	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.388764582886	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
1.0	0.0179096851392	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.341826525936	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
1.0	0.98478172005	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.5	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.0600347586559	That's not true.
0.0	0.302265183495	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.37595218208	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.188456442109	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.337923626238	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
1.0	0.113915786565	It isn't there anymore, Mike.

0.0	0.5	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.343475453245	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.560489996725	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.13733292883	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.0609234749001	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.343846259035	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.335555157938	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.384866977372	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.402167509671	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.408417436569	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.46538550739	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.5	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.287798666243	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.00587306603837	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.382102407349	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.245461004795	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.575427048707	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.0896828598835	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.563032328626	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.0323638816278	Think about that.
0.0	0.106156142602	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.5502609053	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.352978048403	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.305939050048	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.0598523923195	They were wrong.
0.0	0.106196211454	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.426301446332	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.171706081942	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.438191174198	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.304005531413	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.328517914125	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.307074788061	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.390757642054	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.0331950503263	He does great.
0.0	0.2533890782	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.350652972407	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.404488537476	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.389662134108	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.321727201965	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.336997720788	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.23701430958	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.31651579032	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.0789394353573	That's right.
0.0	0.190006174047	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.234878134372	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.0801630030543	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.28384720702	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.475484047932	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.5	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.

0.0	0.204083117651	...income tax...
0.0	0.0353257250681	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.0698037317509	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.117673471242	Of course not.
0.0	0.347551081143	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.0179246088013	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.160538162879	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.0612647698857	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.379679596571	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.402675564532	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.130757096654	It's their money.
0.0	0.213509017284	The world has changed.
0.0	0.0598523923195	He's wrong.
0.0	0.128950127604	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.32255594033	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.261982656575	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.238316562881	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.479119276415	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.555376581906	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.411815029541	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.315207219947	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.444870148774	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.13543001698	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.341983908535	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.196912675352	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.488213353596	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.680254280448	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.492575756192	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.279224608592	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.451457518534	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.401479967093	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.227139488172	I never said that.
0.0	0.263348037813	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.440335824017	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.373772646251	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.160979226614	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.311946634614	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.45374188503	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.434615289898	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.13692572049	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.282029855558	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.11290886948	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.276147920229	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.343834722154	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.345802735872	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.00642697010978	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.283675328199	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.332281714142	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.299316189284	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.0551420036999	And you know what?
0.0	0.340366848799	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.583719757844	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.271818513316	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.363227240101	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.0752209215139	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.544833564017	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.219633693654	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.161778498395	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.0690793775089	It feels different.
0.0	0.282235396836	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.466931181621	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.277318487931	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.282467498469	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.441986255001	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.399867925079	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.290445330126	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.0789394353573	That is not right.
0.0	0.182854067762	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.340501157003	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.469413255878	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.348055817104	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.319602730539	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.378481544267	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.210146252822	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.438675472814	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.481210295552	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.200438748004	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.403440659324	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.412991679822	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.226039142338	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.279356142191	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.0323638816278	Think about it.
0.0	0.288537593272	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.392648350627	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.199149732693	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.127982719646	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.5	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.36874994583	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
1.0	0.567610718716	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.0151965370479	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.170833102898	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.145875043386	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.192140547584	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.613760701951	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.244320214944	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.305109102009	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.24567869748	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.486137772907	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.602408546777	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
1.0	0.993649863014	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.473376911365	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.149902654194	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.189545618266	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.379600252386	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.308896003932	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.448951054993	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.618785044197	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.454932369003	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.271362375999	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.0593453088486	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.478428906804	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.407601337391	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.237918315793	I know every one.
0.0	0.37203097192	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.216389546414	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.346492292209	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.276595981666	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.19669683483	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.73775741228	You did.
0.0	0.0155951515795	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.0600347586559	It's true.
0.0	0.481510173738	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.0610998305819	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.247363552595	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.36319922456	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.460529703064	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.124032714789	Can we stop?
0.0	0.0605537999273	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.162653124575	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.362219198979	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.0278546550071	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.428304189087	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.438668274021	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.347531932857	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.0129064318086	I was the architect.
0.0	0.321229598038	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.209261252924	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.185368510667	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.223317337044	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.105361111577	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.054910288584	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.269590053023	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.41868583937	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.261286076121	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.379638789348	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.23621547498	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.102668202578	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.00358853346282	Thank you.
0.0	0.266708052898	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.304983851944	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.313935075598	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.204159211291	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.246887896375	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.470789585086	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.204230079908	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.365692297364	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.204961518219	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.352447393628	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.0744026562696	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.210133000386	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.351594213544	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.293885055892	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.0985188538902	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.290060837567	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.227145326569	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.311516826404	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.524166482473	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.41907855342	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.51778395431	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.105510821396	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.613950040272	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.327670172738	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.388673511197	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.307832398736	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.260736294297	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.380757986837	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.379795315946	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.219536544824	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.0820886393962	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.

0.0	0.403956158762	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.73775741228	No, you did.
0.0	0.395947707279	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.0492178972508	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.428214035126	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.593741235113	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.487220292814	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.506749394176	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.115439416076	It never happens.
0.0	0.470365780742	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.0708461030386	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.469888063605	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.404393109882	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.138221799838	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.308281296506	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.183145223307	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.5	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.561700230964	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.412086504985	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.137854515441	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.395979996621	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.135644823394	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.73775741228	...
0.0	0.489182961818	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.166142516569	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.425492836698	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.344173549196	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.164481814312	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.147526628924	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.305053874696	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.569685476894	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.452176142192	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.697270814867	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.208738970557	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.486782116532	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.440971487164	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.281108687459	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.487895810176	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.00549114655274	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.362335235752	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.29954350225	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.0550835770464	The answer is no.
0.0	0.176272518349	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.565711484335	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.270353787604	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.29717021512	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.329308667609	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.261624011086	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.3275321523	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.172874749316	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.297790582313	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.0155951515795	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.5	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.240198893849	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.433879283748	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.203476609624	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.329756003154	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.122809435784	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.186905461978	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.166888848674	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.42444680369	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.310153855118	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.114260798422	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.320043729321	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.73775741228	No.
0.0	0.22789858133	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.258346424721	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.328786635603	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.551364323842	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.0919553991365	He has gone to China.
1.0	0.545778530329	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.529297869807	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.564256418123	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.400569680621	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.304364794063	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.161164745914	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.35272161817	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.73775741228	No their not.
0.0	0.584939251938	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.17862385616	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.152400584429	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
1.0	0.994132943723	They were wrong.
0.0	0.5	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.260639804083	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.219011313942	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.0652392109538	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.42731773457	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
1.0	0.990462146749	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.446851919506	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.559197046063	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.423647453247	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.0976266227811	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.0137743333086	On welfare.
0.0	0.0412433187214	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.0489329154737	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.319235577221	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.463718262522	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.745842894006	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.0867758184039	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.105944917889	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.0994381488349	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.451334912453	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.409093342083	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.350999232911	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.138870590282	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.27069870798	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.2788204248	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.238244629714	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.560182344914	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.537844834256	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.220492249254	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.51897196623	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.39900923594	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.61453866187	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.247797005847	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.199930142097	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.55861514724	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.73775741228	...
0.0	0.375358163567	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.0965203527922	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.73775741228	Why?
0.0	0.0595237300838	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.278189151571	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.15954836906	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.150664028455	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.370445471787	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.471385207515	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.73775741228	So...
0.0	0.275267649642	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.160183556235	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.463783706853	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.607003670618	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.344579097708	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.476619069101	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.577110080341	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.160526418339	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.384486172408	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.73775741228	But...
0.0	0.277846771056	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.305517147434	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.405099455486	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
1.0	0.367112558689	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.0500546081028	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.0807237124783	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.375861391158	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.391152979332	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.377438077732	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.19749474592	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.319433987019	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.481810262686	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.548419785136	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.247839546212	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.0500816501561	That's for sure.
0.0	0.21304999753	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.402610103921	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.465288655235	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.256479528626	But many, many people did.

0.0	0.166388205505	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.393030353092	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.20878044665	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.427433458994	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.510575886008	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.439735634408	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.459399683266	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.

0.0	0.39993905602	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.468015186401	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.227463990276	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.427076435798	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.0155951515795	I didn't.
0.0	0.0406867536565	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.246542322799	The Democrats can't even come up with one.

0.0	0.0231490563229	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.209922316568	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.0892170109139	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.341410873615	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.268377375856	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.0551420036999	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.0380409490768	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.313707632808	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.281834581837	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.404621110777	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.336168312703	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.244643482224	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.272111076234	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.217607545999	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.11348554809	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.381165365292	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.398624956777	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.414682510085	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.459231747042	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.399617469323	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.414003235393	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.390619861828	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.420253203049	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.368878465378	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.161600614065	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.47919676699	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.406165172684	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.

0.0	0.249790180686	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.532927281298	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.37237834256	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.352123492014	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.363672215479	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.

0.0	0.292697992875	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.534146975369	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.163298308786	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.340519116363	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.

0.0	0.165324833884	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.178569296615	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.223133238806	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.276502166588	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.135171957751	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.525250611226	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.

0.0	0.488527018393	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.247985105139	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.0731836201737	We don't need that.

0.0	0.136699054518	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.126686125126	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...

0.0	0.536420373457	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.193784939639	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.0815290638044	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.514275730616	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.244403225056	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.131987058967	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.214484096915	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.298632603183	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.439034546326	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.054910288584	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.231127660703	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.395399562686	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.161355467485	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.162623105021	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.292212247871	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.486530929523	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.27696481917	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.165602573055	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.579377113649	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.397760137353	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.443969744995	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.483341378979	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.0895720355157	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.27417698303	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.317363611488	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.359288767982	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.562673205535	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.224992355825	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.163886200774	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.192411602468	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.598910356282	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.345044776196	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.179479108244	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.383335391308	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.39821212771	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.626043235627	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.357028631233	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.372896744931	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.505146462659	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.436641330878	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.63427186584	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.168691401623	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.00475360625704	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.215851770052	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.491467803674	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.289358089448	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.0419535045186	So you might not.
0.0	0.73775741228	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.0762218738643	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.0132912287897	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.272092253688	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.612323820783	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.438989606084	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.0983826198831	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.236885089218	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.403703985964	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.595167837047	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.478331199654	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.332558500179	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.522039922109	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.451959256096	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.0516161285364	I'm ready.
0.0	0.0903316352831	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.0790162038919	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.364999408276	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.314453439765	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.268586110851	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.5	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.41265645148	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.212659410487	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.248012978127	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.109671947657	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.363612970251	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.161609442223	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.506663628946	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.226172061669	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.0551420036999	You know why?
0.0	0.188786897541	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.353654838466	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.417443740063	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.159989198194	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.448183924011	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.151088081744	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.435066718926	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.424916062278	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.550996220212	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.222356108958	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.431689637592	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.337177713262	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.356184460041	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.552197251699	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.190663587141	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.308692511906	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.57134594296	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.517165997946	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.423276546639	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.43955618767	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.375061414969	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.170210245305	That will change everything.
0.0	0.371722431335	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.73775741228	Why is that?
0.0	0.291380782821	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.383301439986	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.491174468673	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.50894885663	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.172718263442	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.522246712842	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.208595654347	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.0153224940514	John?
0.0	0.270206436799	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.474952978696	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.547421637353	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.292587955158	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.153106874388	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.180860960573	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.39465202065	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.463895103323	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.134338933375	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.0196310839649	That's what they're doing.
1.0	0.5	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.358293599226	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.337308896052	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.386506007626	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.38982598136	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.73775741228	These...
0.0	0.145584574444	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.259556324245	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.48005663907	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.536770255632	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.0860441355799	Yes.
0.0	0.225865735299	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.375568783937	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.555917537557	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.346327874329	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.463361608513	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.35068622427	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.359750929704	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.512248916628	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.482898469642	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.130322425732	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.285104786914	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.375243573271	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.207506490955	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.0549162880608	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.212015458608	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.349530264576	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.200572680047	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.263409521652	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.54781468461	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.116250286906	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.357603321272	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.44413566064	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
1.0	0.596479730359	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.161778498395	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.43669425209	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.349927182387	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.0260466338255	I would change them.
0.0	0.393973925256	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.0151965370479	But look...
0.0	0.203056459171	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.432238244338	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.153113472268	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.188853337993	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.412214201765	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.441510808781	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.108493215076	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.107882951751	I said no.
0.0	0.377990959586	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.0638177381355	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.274468057185	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.73775741228	That is...
0.0	0.192981884456	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.277215042233	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.73775741228	I have...
0.0	0.260649389862	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.146476886936	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.140001124227	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.412668572144	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.576263641814	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.509610983344	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.480437400645	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.226289219743	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.423484481681	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.164479889863	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.29077458115	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.354792036821	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.0608361304215	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.389065552141	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.0551420036999	And you know what?
0.0	0.204596088712	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
1.0	0.43962545315	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.178740428748	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.42139504913	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.154300066837	Because now he's going a little bit better.

0.0	0.569234060954	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.206365141837	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.588007414747	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.422623795465	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.466789313046	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.

0.0	0.119243523189	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.42930996568	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
1.0	0.0589726161591	I was not at all critical of him.

0.0	0.202548285285	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.35713149422	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.

0.0	0.0822246132219	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.438437238468	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.00358853346282	Thank you.
0.0	0.22463761652	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.394590170705	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.454188809818	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.368216966096	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.0698082565122	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.429082707067	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.

0.0	0.130295597776	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.396354798178	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.299117790557	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.179874639561	But the president leads in this regard.

0.0	0.414065137906	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.394995220132	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.388484495165	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.282985204588	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.132779399669	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.0248396065361	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.237695205654	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.372077322013	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.516434594184	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.632022908458	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
1.0	0.952409833694	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.117335956493	I'm happy to answer the question...
1.0	0.999994103563	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.289226904778	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.622958051796	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.348578368793	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.199775439856	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.169350867909	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.0794752960488	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.175208685578	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.278819416283	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.206474515736	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.3192853899	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.0955319955023	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.431833080939	You know, I won two record elections.

0.0	0.404540477287	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.464040898835	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.272566660111	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.0992335718327	Let's hope that it holds.

0.0	0.253745312142	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.240008372988	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.261938331559	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.0473373726607	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.24093451993	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.0663070342349	You really can't.

0.0	0.310030700592	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.245422913014	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.201214112643	We actually did it.

0.0	0.527018999751	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.391943565421	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.228124222316	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.270092618076	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.

0.0	0.204684999085	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
1.0	0.624317081974	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.643191062677	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.0609812633004	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.5	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.202479556529	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.330596143669	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.315395572248	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.287596570961	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.00358853346282	Thank you.
0.0	0.318671535919	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.284502330686	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.348106259102	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.645802249262	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.365743082474	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
1.0	0.981914117948	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.0819668367227	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.284168188902	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.554935644514	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.156192160372	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.134900842123	This would be devastating for the economy.

0.0	0.273064257779	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.412599068791	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.556639083559	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.440510119738	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.280020494379	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.147549317476	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.117673471242	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.164222092949	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.0972723498752	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.482917543097	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.17223334777	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.0832678716541	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.165687769807	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.353327576432	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.38060367968	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.243408492531	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
1.0	0.484438674494	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.115313697408	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.343724512409	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.371410125486	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.48685353275	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.256561659324	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.619342965041	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.354189979979	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.0919041228765	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.387974842226	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.330210127204	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
1.0	0.974622120842	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.188342473788	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.277670054209	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.274376504247	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.284265191335	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.425691862925	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.226650795805	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.483686171832	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.248713574819	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.0835706666001	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.296815042539	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.641381482721	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.338839610896	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.18571857651	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.242843493701	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.525962778715	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
1.0	0.994556658707	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.58974593618	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.043334963318	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.18180966676	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.359320866877	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.329304489307	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.47122147134	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.421506147702	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.440271230358	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.295494899837	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.236541104201	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.0551420036999	You know that.
1.0	0.452389691526	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.23318179093	This country is changing.
0.0	0.124269580999	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.456397915748	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.242868666282	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.211927440824	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.319067539229	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.470890624138	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.162653711314	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.310856076455	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.061414581789	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.00943518338923	No accomplishment.
1.0	0.13424132944	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.374537735122	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.107718359043	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.0670977951685	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.354394494411	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.517280311397	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.182582499964	I changed it in New Jersey.
1.0	0.995108884633	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
1.0	0.64099877263	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.209727052342	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.45373846304	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.428993295986	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
1.0	0.982771619931	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.0146320051425	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.239571023763	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.378813035485	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.73775741228	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.541015928806	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.422378572371	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.346182300737	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.34945874671	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.421578170233	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.345688656793	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.420409818835	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.458680096648	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.385086507253	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.

0.0	0.5184925879	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.

0.0	0.211327794787	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.373528257893	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.

0.0	0.388628316373	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.288183701316	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.

0.0	0.543068206678	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.446649878778	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.

1.0	0.00464501497614	They stole it.
0.0	0.238886250701	We need sound money.
0.0	0.355035457585	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.443537251666	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.0545876969495	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.254875392147	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.530960424037	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.556158458178	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.413608812053	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.398352423199	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.248337488135	The big Internet companies.
1.0	0.988707800935	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.159731441194	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.207840852417	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.518299924307	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.73775741228	No.
0.0	0.117423540938	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.183566629112	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.

0.0	0.00920147196051	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.0717902847851	You have to lead.
0.0	0.0944370279125	I've laid out...
0.0	0.460349870951	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.36823761067	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.125832478225	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.0447667810711	And God bless America.

0.0	0.312074625891	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.3374127153	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.28491415335	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.333145517616	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.106381613883	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.225049592634	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.267613783573	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.362973300103	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.172546188287	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.397833544462	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
1.0	0.997133326082	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.193715639272	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.164677140867	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.401037093883	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.387399158333	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.13084150899	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.174956446334	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.34945601671	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.162004734275	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.0922498923167	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.315594959714	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.40345213828	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.319837066993	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.0487145736432	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.28384720702	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.377180294732	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.151775028527	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.39889008117	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.460472868948	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.459546904347	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.51824829173	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.333261230092	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.422070099232	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.123942795855	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.349394790226	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.359859954158	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.338665929094	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.315316182793	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.0669265509212	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.16637227846	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.437912064031	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.173200646233	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.0191899396045	Yeah.
0.0	0.331547440542	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.0744026562696	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.637894573057	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.350739416451	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
1.0	0.986459336534	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.18455541305	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.113033044924	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.416332100544	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.0808208764786	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.65131838254	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.366035279458	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.303882111027	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.0602949090602	We're friends.
0.0	0.0751241464998	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.391203735328	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.23435043995	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.00588354487627	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.315913539389	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
1.0	0.972898699658	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.0121181183303	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.27490995281	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.13132922448	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.100635863662	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.347539148437	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.366320941463	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.304183116503	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.390907050758	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.0551420036999	But you know what?
0.0	0.5	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.509050359358	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.587867088605	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.5	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.0555687281547	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.391736472383	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.380186115866	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.230621992384	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.319424209519	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.363867609043	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.478874713682	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.493904767873	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.249532002262	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.104593366749	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.481449842051	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.0328615171528	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.0613018898519	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.479988765725	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.5	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.414741017081	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.437104481443	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.44049083816	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.378867652493	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.

0.0	0.527898141438	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.471520838097	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.

0.0	0.0668033328894	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.263088072512	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.418106452384	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
