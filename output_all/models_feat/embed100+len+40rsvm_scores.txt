0.0	0.223697811931	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.740707489472	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.294822669259	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.32023342314	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.535015895602	We now have a gun on every table.
0.0	0.0746156729086	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
1.0	0.983714707386	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.192119688149	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.270866933307	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.214364666757	My wife, Jane, has been -- way back when before I knew her, a foster parent.
0.0	0.216731108961	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.0599752595276	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.307619593923	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.476368735737	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.0373836282127	They're going to build in Mexico.
0.0	0.47524566257	They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.
0.0	0.619585419014	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.0312360477239	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.507416693954	We have to do away with the strawman proposal.
0.0	0.177340803898	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.0959525114278	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.190108305358	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.0644545714515	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.117808939806	And, they asked about her email situation.
0.0	0.279535035185	This is revolutionary for education in America.
0.0	0.0885740335091	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.
0.0	0.0241748518665	You know, I like Marco.
0.0	0.0922151274778	Now, here's what is going to happen.
0.0	0.10922991985	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.357124090865	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.
0.0	0.0717252714418	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.0925399442101	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.230949041035	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.614541745357	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.343572695054	My son is not a pair of boots on the ground.
0.0	0.26612165901	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.447106210336	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.158637185629	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.610855822771	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.0851906974591	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.824361295589	And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.
1.0	0.983726748201	Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.
0.0	0.163944979195	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.425114706426	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.0504157126274	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.13346593303	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.44887444911	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.0265708370962	Right.
0.0	0.43908428232	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.105255311305	If he'd like to play, that's fine.
0.0	0.230237083548	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.292053956959	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.156510989125	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.293293386035	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.629288563087	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.84012861235	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
0.0	0.150236487484	I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.
0.0	0.100462161101	I said, "how's it going?"
0.0	0.99628595694	Do the $12 and you would index it.
0.0	0.573979440443	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.122573033305	It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.
0.0	0.744612138013	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.157402252384	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.293293386035	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.0844018834791	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.463622234715	The biggest bank in the world is from China.
0.0	0.133630592991	... (inaudible) opening statement.
0.0	0.45731285538	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
1.0	0.999996115447	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.0725284977011	David, let me give you a little bit of background here.
0.0	0.385978036566	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.556773256602	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.287042018239	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.0931068179998	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.0599716127294	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.521806546025	But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that.
0.0	0.170528949696	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.490473134048	If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.
0.0	0.243143262717	And it's-- it's a worthy debate.
0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.
0.0	0.157360354097	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.491918900775	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.0282842716558	Let's have a Democratic Syria.
0.0	0.0681591937305	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.0103345551465	Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.
0.0	0.556258496485	But, bottom line is this is the year 2015.
0.0	0.475289923608	... that's the -- that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration.
0.0	0.162153591241	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.107589942249	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.310361668088	We were the first in the family.
0.0	0.65291123729	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.
0.0	0.419642118978	Never support.
0.0	0.446922106716	And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina, and many other Republican states, that because of their right wing political ideology, are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.258096659881	At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically.
0.0	0.141830836622	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.729487020089	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.320844977625	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.15945498873	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.0699580404089	No problem.
0.0	0.200870144713	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.352315635482	It's not true.
0.0	0.994303034819	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.132968558062	That's just media stuff.
0.0	0.0206779997859	We don't know anything about that.
0.0	0.0266171693596	All right.
0.0	0.070631101941	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.201499481885	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.304914534058	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.290789630896	But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.
1.0	0.542854296227	Twenty-one mass shootings, including one last weekend in Des Moins where three were murdered.
0.0	0.306868924164	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.235242183522	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.183526468813	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.677393058913	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
1.0	0.00459026410287	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.273321710781	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
1.0	0.896558342029	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.508060052624	They started in Iowa.
0.0	0.306133491771	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.601954684774	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.225031909441	As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that.
0.0	0.336261987311	He said, "Yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.0580388442418	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.687699558822	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.000183728361275	Reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.645000063383	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.282277743567	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.147164827008	I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran.
0.0	0.201373528668	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.783581599316	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.235290409316	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.190628550209	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.441620636237	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.179639503852	We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.
0.0	0.898449734689	And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.
0.0	0.132916618698	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.0799465615109	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.0725177041053	I kind of miss Donald Trump.
0.0	0.477973629462	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.0610697593174	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.474702840259	Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors.
0.0	0.185241644846	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.394365766028	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.0536695045893	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.219905674625	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.0556779558912	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.0295924396621	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.293396788778	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
0.0	0.0604245913377	We're dying.
0.0	0.0974489263521	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.24266737288	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.
0.0	0.310884052172	But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.
0.0	0.442021525392	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.187413576139	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.0873417317519	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.0301900641584	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.0798396072844	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.184704381527	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.976917328879	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.195557880291	So...
0.0	0.201840986131	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
0.0	0.0574181664552	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.291004936254	I promise.
0.0	0.689428043712	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.020446811856	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.274939659633	Here's the story.
0.0	0.418231511367	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.163889627016	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.156767504699	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.564256912738	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.905662361422	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.276260292367	We saw what happened in Egypt.
0.0	0.206043100298	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.162981497872	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.177378117914	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.475757380904	They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.
0.0	0.374026523272	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
1.0	0.584612702548	I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded.
0.0	0.162963577057	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.232138396901	But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible.
0.0	0.345713027337	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.18676186917	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.163746734516	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.30507721853	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.243692023413	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.085001948456	Good at email.
0.0	0.254894039713	We need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table.
0.0	0.116103492896	If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
0.0	0.0385815642269	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.204901560687	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.0457438608716	That's the big leagues.
0.0	0.261211654196	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.
0.0	0.209127018697	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.126333454876	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.262409404626	The first vote hasn't been counted.
0.0	0.0497321962026	Maria...

0.0	0.420951160621	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
0.0	0.122486238748	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.51286518507	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.

0.0	0.30594380632	Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.
0.0	0.258854530921	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?

0.0	0.556117007032	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.0731027537424	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.0485357054584	Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth.
0.0	0.174924544105	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.143149309778	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.776694002602	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.
0.0	0.312011578635	You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
0.0	0.272676687649	I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it.
0.0	0.0593721660625	Let me just...
0.0	0.170752412109	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.232519446341	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.284429611293	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
0.0	0.244915653521	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.352315635482	That's not true.
0.0	0.965930304072	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.20699649604	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.11089505435	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
1.0	0.862946937646	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.417476634903	When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war.
0.0	0.448935294932	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.0794225423286	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.0984456110947	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.43322423929	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.382801789415	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.157217615835	I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible.
0.0	0.148629702904	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.487859134491	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.941961202941	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.114377506206	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.0937767012561	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.125186311484	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.173944225541	You can't hide behind parliamentary tricks.
1.0	0.946297208238	The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.
0.0	0.0215911534475	I agree with that.
0.0	0.338802600349	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.245640911713	When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal?
1.0	0.900313712083	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
1.0	0.705211236517	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.655125637638	No hour is too short, no dollar too small.
0.0	0.37306118804	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.646279036992	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.257796057523	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.175958066359	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.0884863156315	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.520416620979	Check it out.
0.0	0.663797474408	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.0196064568415	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.691547061055	And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details.
0.0	0.0530265059891	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.159558785688	You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.
0.0	0.198155926894	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.0112758239859	Yeah.
0.0	0.354781764577	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.0898997368854	But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.
0.0	0.132507618107	He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long.
0.0	0.149089297013	And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you're a governor.
0.0	0.570063298762	What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people.
1.0	0.595704565015	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.0754591754555	And you have to really work hard at it.
0.0	0.00611638007669	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.200669098342	For her convenience.
0.0	0.841781189632	And, unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage, I actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.0490540923984	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.335071439088	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.219445242041	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.0661842048736	I've gotta do it."
0.0	0.0656276504411	We have losers.
1.0	0.953878691338	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.334030645346	He said, "we have the military in the streets right now.
0.0	0.162658895528	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.062040338234	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.638168837338	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.359041215487	And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq.
0.0	0.193618513327	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
0.0	0.116434516929	There has never been a jihadist group like this.
0.0	0.198330963614	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.157417653423	By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job.
0.0	0.530728164656	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.0526388396213	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.130024127719	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.157382905965	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.73121464327	Number one...
0.0	0.429446903185	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.172343020557	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.137174427078	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.97850715753	Real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years.
0.0	0.168436031735	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.54095061801	I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.
0.0	0.2818648948	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.0594145521878	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.130224555827	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.291980091033	But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.359875919738	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.180145658919	Bigger than that?
0.0	0.0367226125861	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.187198846245	She is not qualified to be President of the United States.
0.0	0.412091536828	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.896677331316	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.201830773156	But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.
0.0	0.0875753152187	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.511146540615	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.295042707493	And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump," and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns.
0.0	0.589942214272	But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired.
0.0	0.0470072668613	Let's...
0.0	0.046170254827	That's when we become Greece.
0.0	0.0952966309573	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.0845133987753	But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
0.0	0.361564011063	I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.
0.0	0.165673803497	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.
0.0	0.0274983171825	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.33960126218	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.196386816852	What are we doing?

0.0	0.190130078635	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.413367368273	We have fought, as Democrats, for decades to get a health care plan.
0.0	0.0935441212647	It didn't have the votes to pass.

0.0	0.31265841066	I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor, I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very, very powerful and most important of all jobs in the United States, the president, whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country.

0.0	0.0809626896116	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.195557880291	No.
0.0	0.19611021003	This is 2016.
0.0	0.0366660727973	Not the change we need at a time we need it.

0.0	0.447879530881	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.0638346699913	We lose on trade.

0.0	0.127547468439	If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country.
0.0	0.558971738228	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.266428373991	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.

0.0	0.0331600299753	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.348457281769	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
1.0	0.334276179424	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.397375770566	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.297561663495	No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.
0.0	0.222537518123	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

0.0	0.305284746746	I'll advertise my Web site as well.
0.0	0.36409753601	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.922678632111	If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.
0.0	0.191875536166	And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.
0.0	0.065607876465	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.160995246122	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.622870629547	We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that's what's keeping him contained.

0.0	0.0445351854094	You're right.
0.0	0.583045315498	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.0767406972422	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.251009555497	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
1.0	0.316666228785	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.280981748057	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.299549633941	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.036981454328	I hate to hear it."
0.0	0.246164925488	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.

0.0	0.246529340634	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.216327170198	So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.
0.0	0.26430644341	And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world.

0.0	0.194243866671	Thank you, good night and may the force be with you.
0.0	0.190252506596	I am telling the truth.
0.0	0.216695444448	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.244445521448	And the world, no doubt is a better place without him.
0.0	0.807425827271	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
0.0	0.406236715497	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.201534484047	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.305333926647	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.288378084784	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.101401608276	I can do that.

0.0	0.0773899664317	They will never make America great again.
0.0	0.26628322277	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.106060798152	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.0365227037789	I love China.
0.0	0.152105325955	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.0209486643721	Here's what I believe.
0.0	0.302364518363	Doctors are quitting.
0.0	0.133929507614	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.558736385562	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.

0.0	0.346836692753	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.186975689562	And I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well.
0.0	0.181511983014	Can I just add one very quick thing?

0.0	0.0188024933721	I'm very proud.

0.0	0.107815782521	Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy.
0.0	0.469470871805	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.100596493331	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.0408005770467	I think they'd want to hear it.
0.0	0.076326455575	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.981830128248	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.331363474987	The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
0.0	0.321144581881	And it has three parts.
0.0	0.302213558119	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.15047660476	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.437816674185	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.249169806563	It all will be scrutinized.
0.0	0.640276369122	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.194871449848	You learn to create a security cabinet.
0.0	0.448938558978	We have to go after what is called the shadow banking industry.
0.0	0.567286025211	But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.
0.0	0.254225653697	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.519503923443	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.01017528996	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.0707020524999	And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China.
0.0	0.253859319546	But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.
0.0	0.289753437121	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.845679341788	Seventeen more million more people have health care.
0.0	0.195557880291	No.
0.0	0.225241946174	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.0405943708857	Big difference.
0.0	0.267502497024	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.389301161433	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.0907640344	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.0555144125077	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.
0.0	0.142663190228	I know every one.
0.0	0.0191917141657	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.188307368769	You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?
0.0	0.136342951188	We were wrong.
0.0	0.718283073832	But here, a total net worth of -- net worth, not assets, not -- a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets -- Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York -- many other places all over the world.
0.0	0.214996716898	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.161200338991	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.0893465148855	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.62421884112	In fact, if you remember, 50, 60 years ago, the University of California, City University of New York were virtually tuition-free.
0.0	0.154154122216	Today I heard it.
0.0	0.142764637503	I have no idea.
0.0	0.217623823713	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.170730540557	That's the difference, and that's the kind of leader we need in the White House.
0.0	0.224735769681	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.361047559564	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.350226261724	It was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up.
0.0	0.0236505381483	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.42657190508	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.812533249665	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.303763918589	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.733341736244	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.282731025046	First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.116990927405	Folks, it's not too late.
0.0	0.151396075768	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.48454483254	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.279265668841	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.0156493804763	There is a vacuum.
0.0	0.110206690232	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.0770191654289	And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.721806450915	Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.
0.0	0.128429876318	And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?
0.0	0.439500141822	And so people are still going to get health care, thankfully, in emergency rooms, in hospitals.
0.0	0.401546195952	People came back from Iraq and Afghanistan without legs, without arms.
0.0	0.489413411593	He thinks low wages are a good idea.
0.0	0.542445031579	Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago.
0.0	0.385628666669	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.
0.0	0.195833897857	It was.
0.0	0.0929185301784	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.10135954618	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.118720310605	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.0868798540265	So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.
0.0	0.684468572959	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.0619528847176	I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena.
0.0	0.394935964214	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
1.0	0.417356019485	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.211898717944	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.461404717806	We have people that are morally corrupt.
0.0	0.384059818215	She led that effort.
0.0	0.0393679862698	I totally get that.
0.0	0.453522690803	Chris I was mentioned in that question.
0.0	0.246374008847	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.478584149511	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.68517734449	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.549082950772	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.122185171831	I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party's nominee.
0.0	0.547400953476	My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, which sparked my interest in the need for immigration reform because I know what it's like to be the son of an immigrant.
0.0	0.316217697458	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.208580479122	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.452512560408	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.283751311068	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.424409980617	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.228707011044	Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly.
0.0	0.0488528220548	That's not fair.
0.0	0.336170124739	Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them.
0.0	0.199530025068	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.
0.0	0.0822829633478	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.332681837989	And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
0.0	0.128344322216	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.755559073476	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
1.0	0.988116573499	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.237724880736	Ask Boeing.
0.0	0.365800012694	Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come...
0.0	0.286764262709	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.228833801823	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.447940967232	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.188445315533	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.200628639783	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.218633136126	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.335677851238	They;re gone.
0.0	0.294105782703	Major crisis and primary health care.
0.0	0.816623125223	First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty.
0.0	0.0216020799698	But you know what?
0.0	0.379638045786	Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.340207719245	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
0.0	0.56926695865	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.129844336357	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.335547444729	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.389865820597	In the 1980s, it was in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Reagan's administration, and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel, and others were murdered.
0.0	0.900777082089	They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.
0.0	0.0690017244282	I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House.
0.0	0.0243576277715	They were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.16445006104	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.447836100229	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.745280420323	Hey, I have lobbyists.
0.0	0.123748475308	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.
0.0	0.105506935315	I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third.
0.0	0.648074230903	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.653869875569	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.648026573432	Clearly the best piece of veterans' legislation brought forth in decades.
0.0	0.136482167854	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.195557880291	No.
0.0	0.55797462025	I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.
0.0	0.801969525148	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.161594045742	The Obama administration.
0.0	0.715545628357	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.403883038108	... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.357558618951	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.0311106094913	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.458826430406	So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act.
0.0	0.0731846737639	Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
1.0	0.677547720155	I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer.
0.0	0.424570633133	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.15163648764	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.306009666762	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.0373608821016	I think he'd be a great spirit."
0.0	0.0840372890811	There's been no crowd like this.
0.0	0.773208458591	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
0.0	0.461424880183	No, both the federal and a state approach.
0.0	0.200545234799	People who we should be welcoming and working with.
0.0	0.143108321363	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.0562395310002	They have no choice.
0.0	0.0820174256773	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.285747507711	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.37423943761	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.22640981589	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.651229109083	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.598762461718	We brought together legislation supported by the American Legion, the VFW, the DOD, Vietnam Vets, all of the veterans organizations, which was comprehensive.
0.0	0.416734064948	No, John.
0.0	0.5	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
1.0	0.696318681709	$10.10 was all I could get the state to do by the time I left in my last year.
0.0	0.0550316197059	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.893867057219	We have artificially low interest rates.
0.0	0.205948125846	She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.5	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.0290319052317	May I respond?
0.0	0.0142566284334	But they're not good.
0.0	0.0861676589141	I (inaudible).
0.0	0.182285949751	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.332666707913	You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
0.0	0.297024232775	We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.
0.0	0.115109564878	You see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, I'm an optimist
1.0	0.99999900114	In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship.
0.0	0.123026366916	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.40081703128	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.361543562049	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.424883492524	And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.
1.0	0.274615362972	We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.34617691357	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.0640208236942	And they wanted to make sure it got built.
0.0	0.37638029902	Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons.
0.0	0.379397369765	And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young, old, everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard.
0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.
0.0	0.19662512809	Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.
0.0	0.0834119502881	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.0623708239251	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.142407131852	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.169851445723	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.127232172561	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.217702477095	We have tremendous people.
0.0	0.494713594928	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.185760919077	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.
0.0	0.112802464036	Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
0.0	0.279270754815	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.279907747419	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.0703836749112	But I would say this to you, Bret.
0.0	0.479509870494	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.349412420709	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.78910184032	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.118682233728	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.196171203891	We need to do it now as a nation.
0.0	0.322483857095	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.1074075549	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.119030682786	Am I supposed to dislike them?
0.0	0.18420383952	I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.
0.0	0.364366884256	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.124097109781	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.402330933181	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.143127092323	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.417654208134	They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.
0.0	0.0552597767695	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.473266014815	And for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.
0.0	0.258889908615	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.623479748133	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.0365227037789	I love China.
0.0	0.0449200050539	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.070020773244	And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.
0.0	0.426925797714	... and we will end the illegal immigration.
0.0	0.190394611753	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.0768308166609	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.34309888222	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.281285892067	This is a bad deal.
1.0	0.706397545647	According to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.753257970539	To tell Qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep.
1.0	0.999999621596	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.112277337943	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.196704469931	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.635431027258	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.0855387050784	They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America.
0.0	0.11498306937	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.120865271313	Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris.
0.0	0.0306048221212	Neil...
0.0	0.157610976236	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.561436088361	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.275963111764	They've got nothing but money.
0.0	0.323037333999	And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.
0.0	0.0060761669834	OK.
0.0	0.430942546148	Every (inaudible) Democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rosa DeLauro, got ears (ph) to legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave.
0.0	0.308346488371	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.132693542101	Now, what the magic number is, I don't know, because we don't know the extent of the problem.
0.0	0.261981213149	So we need people -- I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.219576723238	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.512898546072	When he brought forward the "Gang of Eight" bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.
0.0	0.493599300835	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.570296111561	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.377357764326	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
1.0	0.724868796919	It was below zero.
0.0	0.309786938295	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.0264615394886	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.0798251057439	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.0428504472353	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.128191933864	We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression.
0.0	0.493433215672	Not only -- not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton -- and I hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- I want to apologize to my supporters.
0.0	0.153690151525	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.530947618365	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.136717276906	They had a plan that was good.
0.0	0.0648299588466	We've got to hate the Muslims."
0.0	0.370301009815	We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party.
0.0	0.0265708370962	Right.
0.0	0.225991661248	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.223031074704	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.573033132019	Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.
0.0	0.294773776411	Your question was you have disagreed...
0.0	0.449893395462	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.267522092653	And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.509105517581	In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.
0.0	0.474773901752	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.149940786674	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.123961481367	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
0.0	0.533021517521	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.19322385234	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.286455524931	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.231398906439	And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't."
0.0	0.0596227510109	So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
0.0	0.359625866749	We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up.
0.0	0.233936639257	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.0191688998393	But I learned a lot.
0.0	0.195980129161	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.319294319311	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.
0.0	0.0963811502163	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.137593655203	But, I said, "This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people.
0.0	0.27495016865	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.0859764615221	... Chris, your questions that you...
0.0	0.0679413608946	If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.
0.0	0.881659988551	As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.473137721302	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.
0.0	0.12090974585	We must able to work collaboratively with others.
0.0	0.113754046586	Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.
0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.
0.0	0.27289164341	I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.
0.0	0.0704158107649	Megyn, that's the problem.
0.0	0.634979740353	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.391564018211	In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...
0.0	0.0655183090961	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.295110352527	Bill after coming home from Japan, flying 33 missions.
0.0	0.0266635813921	That's right.
0.0	0.197279492811	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.143039733565	And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.
0.0	0.0765767094936	People say, "Oh, you don't like China?"
0.0	0.183971533247	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.154719858958	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.335239678235	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
0.0	0.273883764044	This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.
0.0	0.771313646114	We were the first to pass a minimum wage.
0.0	0.154617443169	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...
0.0	0.390607484616	A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.
0.0	0.235472006913	That's not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.
0.0	0.219297239556	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.0871382887317	And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.
0.0	0.210813801783	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.0605419578939	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.055602208841	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.447540327119	We talked about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.282628320966	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.06168671634	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.110519623789	Yes.
0.0	0.249658886226	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.290551038386	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.308748201981	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.0743160994703	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.11182049004	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.284551989858	Ever.
0.0	0.105191340001	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...
0.0	0.365840790132	Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?
0.0	0.155168306028	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.377299659236	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.452763744595	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.0396432134464	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.462361297226	The troops on the ground should not be American troops.
0.0	0.127459182405	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
0.0	0.267272765038	I changed that.
0.0	0.182025669421	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.200219546477	And we ought to fight them on that level.
0.0	0.257924146829	Please become part of the political revolution.
0.0	0.312318600808	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.00660938319899	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.0567353465446	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.46051700723	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.0100942175241	I don't care.
0.0	0.73982886863	What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.0178073423933	They don't have a clue.
0.0	0.249290548095	And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.
0.0	0.445032785258	We bailed out Wall Street.
0.0	0.421401764453	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.80474780108	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.165798801205	And we have nothing.
0.0	0.33222242797	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.343601415353	We now have that.
0.0	0.0270606347341	We have the opposite thinking.
0.0	0.364419326348	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.288652718337	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.094186051007	Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.
0.0	0.089003009594	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.264516900114	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.0753882015134	We don't have victories anymore.
0.0	0.258434207879	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.223541071002	I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.
0.0	0.118304523979	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.397598306606	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.0731631389775	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.146483831395	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.
0.0	0.256182369745	They sweated like dogs.
0.0	0.00250876191284	Alright.
0.0	0.530380292662	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.488029112588	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.0216020799698	And you know what?
0.0	0.172357527057	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.0395701355864	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.443050061878	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.22949847877	That's because we've put conservative policies in place.
0.0	0.259541905819	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.0835645898926	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.195833897857	It was...
0.0	0.352409469352	Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.
0.0	0.363457219388	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.179295376607	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.0060761669834	OK.
0.0	0.850835101924	And I applaud his record in Maryland.
0.0	0.368874991584	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
1.0	0.931803048538	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.314327471396	He's been a negative force.
0.0	0.462665896054	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.128501638595	We got a U.N. Security council vote.
0.0	0.208751919694	Here's the bottom line.
1.0	0.160443624918	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.23367041069	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.13401491342	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.5	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.229743846513	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
0.0	0.136342951188	He's wrong.
0.0	0.0955424637587	But I can tell you this.

0.0	0.0691242580901	That is the clear and present danger.

0.0	0.183028471043	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.200447847709	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.885623788231	And I ended a federal entitlement.

0.0	0.0215643958283	You know why?
0.0	0.459474743635	And so, look, the way that -- a stronger middle class is actually the source of economic growth.
0.0	0.242824083613	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.200296327218	David, thank you.
0.0	0.186538356777	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.0159599377808	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.0581649161098	And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are.
0.0	0.477798542849	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.182609328733	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
1.0	0.999993823594	I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance.
0.0	0.192297698152	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.190036395676	And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that.
0.0	0.5	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.195053951882	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.119417651756	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.176191855375	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
1.0	0.821032424102	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.0266171693596	All right.
0.0	0.296742587505	Mark my words.
0.0	0.378332482688	We got it done in my state by leading with principal and that's what we need to do as a party for comprehensive gun safety.
0.0	0.519190245278	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.175950068062	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.237513325644	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.
0.0	0.70799981854	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.0060761669834	OK.
0.0	0.300135343166	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.17321695146	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.112207399536	I was in Burlington, Iowa.

0.0	0.00787171912163	We are rebuilding China.
0.0	0.035035293453	Not bad.
0.0	0.0847892331745	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.365313352058	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.209490160946	But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.
0.0	0.36565342104	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
0.0	0.271236680652	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.0858545999759	That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.
0.0	0.135806915155	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.588095461201	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.319905088495	But, of course, international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today.
0.0	0.493446076891	We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate.
0.0	0.0946346280685	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.178718957745	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.44538414006	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.693432891584	We're spending $80 billion locking people up, disproportionately Latino and African American.
0.0	0.316729351997	Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.
0.0	0.097645665464	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.253380998043	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.688357721712	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.229309655275	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.29686804673	It's affordable for everybody.
0.0	0.170735881706	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.108312005449	He is a good man.
0.0	0.509813541582	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.113190341994	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.181873262521	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.0586032472608	I know the bad ones.
0.0	0.101473541424	That is exactly...
0.0	0.0726501376584	He's a progressive economist.
0.0	0.209408423097	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.320673329606	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.104091021592	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.0894320715866	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.116996855539	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.638778006582	When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish Glass-Stegall.
0.0	0.634093755767	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.295978372795	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.0159770955523	And we're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.169853263728	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.11357115798	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.0913312949521	... but wait a minute...
0.0	0.0120823796128	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.102593910066	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.195557880291	No.
1.0	0.241758005307	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.546646923463	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.610772492398	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.140084504865	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.0421982933346	Can you believe this?
0.0	0.449796003002	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.0825401959747	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.196386816852	What should we do?
0.0	0.359744773246	And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.
0.0	0.139101362359	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.0838759907111	We're running.
0.0	0.255872434847	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.0671567115517	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.271933239471	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.0443275263761	Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.
0.0	0.485621464725	And the U.S. chamber of commerce, which hardly ever says nice things about Democratic governors anywhere, named our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship.
0.0	0.0584890327781	You count on it.
0.0	0.12457245387	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.200500466955	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.534325324701	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.0216020799698	And you know what?
0.0	0.5	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.108793439649	this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.
0.0	0.877101913417	About Medicare?
0.0	0.120198743547	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.528073712087	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
1.0	0.610002502624	And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
0.0	0.111542519047	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.763924527051	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.132209371461	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
1.0	0.56837279475	We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks a piece.
0.0	0.337637258555	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.1628022618	Let's get rid of Assad later.
0.0	0.25483894203	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
1.0	0.981016514685	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.455518999385	It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.
0.0	0.0799327623102	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.338995864037	Then, in 2008, you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying that we don't need those regulations on the federal level and now you're coming back around here.
0.0	0.342309460182	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.584203817299	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.356180768625	That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive.
0.0	0.266469635903	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.0674597525582	In this building, in Trump Tower.
0.0	0.592559648545	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.266239887575	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.061810495212	Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.
0.0	0.349365024439	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.0868668536302	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.120669930263	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.253747504738	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.485010571292	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.611132506426	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.592944508972	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.0788273357201	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.113837064157	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.175223132099	Well, thank you.
0.0	0.101401608276	You can do both.
0.0	0.455505028302	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.0286679202389	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.0717320531968	That's fine.
0.0	0.108035951171	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.420520867679	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.347950440266	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.0689813263801	Good evening.
1.0	0.991701116788	And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.
0.0	0.469379905715	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.126526178119	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.818354225093	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.0325046787922	... and I'd like to respond.
1.0	0.522364139434	Unfortunately, Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, set about decimating it.
1.0	0.999998992711	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.515623649049	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.0949965028462	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
0.0	0.248773950343	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.192949725008	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.0110036427336	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.234268056854	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
1.0	0.999999706756	In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.
0.0	0.559530415972	They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.468796046933	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.351096111377	And that's only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.
0.0	0.113374523758	And look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that.
0.0	0.271498918152	Well, you know, governor, I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010.
0.0	0.121914415164	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.40906418452	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.0791498756588	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.210961183252	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.165065559966	I said, "Is he intelligent?"
0.0	0.154584487495	So -- because we got to make the country rich.
0.0	0.154988108266	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.0980172497031	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.0332115001673	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.775758626727	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.0763932019696	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.714089734249	Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs.
0.0	0.0501806894174	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.168744266075	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.149530336643	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.
0.0	0.289285488908	When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it.
0.0	0.0438841339399	And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.
0.0	0.307430474652	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.157535911662	So, yes, I did know people.
0.0	0.183223684964	... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do.
0.0	0.19772816542	How the hell can you vote for this guy?
0.0	0.415499165168	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.292524830141	That can be done without profiling people.
0.0	0.256426141364	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.44657453972	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.53896701349	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
1.0	0.917538887102	People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.
0.0	0.395134378852	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.649676709344	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.466918794096	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.170504421568	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.317674068712	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.5716024052	When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
0.0	0.329302673916	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.0605034671763	But not for us.
0.0	0.210842647223	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.478962311512	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.102741806173	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.464132795315	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.223643920071	Germany, many other countries do it already.
0.0	0.0215267768709	We know...
0.0	0.381245275348	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.244887535619	But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.
0.0	0.508162797327	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.155102833829	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.359966257871	I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.
0.0	0.534325324701	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.142478043622	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.215378779916	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.596975181524	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.410444073786	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.340931175241	But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything.
0.0	0.0236140715312	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.0609338079408	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.27937288554	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.191876922593	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.136485836138	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.361920373445	They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it."
0.0	0.102792001224	I do and this is an important issue and I know we'll get to a lot of other critical ones as well.
0.0	0.158993345517	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.0953910328883	That I can tell you.
0.0	0.205472359419	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.191214355342	They would like to rip it up and start all over again, throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now.
0.0	0.494758459221	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.248948471222	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.244397585526	You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?
0.0	0.220979352895	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.476461601684	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.177958315026	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
0.0	0.231244652123	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.0505130086021	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.0340954640386	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.123956845432	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
0.0	0.220864416525	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.136875172901	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.284067737702	When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up.
0.0	0.681271925871	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.0168621989607	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.
0.0	0.287950828862	Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity.
0.0	0.0881279298978	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.
0.0	0.338049741201	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.13121158948	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.190516930159	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.612513194362	I do not support amnesty...

0.0	0.601194893705	I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation.
0.0	0.17806908913	I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.
0.0	0.183445211749	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
0.0	0.0450869103461	I think we're missing the point here.
0.0	0.465485911524	I mean, my dad went to college on a G.I.
0.0	0.321964448119	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.155769957404	I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.
0.0	0.285467491538	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.876917589	The number of heroin deaths are growing very, very significantly.
0.0	0.904632195408	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.121863620072	And America's best days are in front of us if we move forward together.
0.0	0.060919283132	It is not tough talk.
0.0	0.183994297379	Our country has tremendous potential.
0.0	0.14628624129	I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.
0.0	0.310488340588	So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
0.0	0.162204029005	By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa.
0.0	0.155981859816	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.0208852243309	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.0941109724617	... not everybody else.
0.0	0.174297059771	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.387548413327	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.809453855434	In the last 30 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth.
0.0	0.228831302333	We have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as General Dempsey said.
0.0	0.639145910132	Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.
0.0	0.0599863372662	And they're all over the place.
0.0	0.106830168652	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.2446213022	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.0891023333318	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.756403538233	They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
0.0	0.213860990965	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.104246953449	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.166274998851	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.888373340958	They are refusing to...
1.0	0.999999888691	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.0937393771178	People that know me, like me.
0.0	0.291778730089	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.257783083735	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
1.0	0.999996890886	It didn't say a word about legalization.
0.0	0.0209852812487	That's what we believe in.
0.0	0.96081229545	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.0997517609743	I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.
1.0	0.988575428851	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.90624153294	Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day.
0.0	0.650512706169	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.827991764468	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.192544914021	You know where their United States headquarters is located?
0.0	0.4570820946	And that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity -- kill people who are unarmed who should not be killed, they must be held accountable.
0.0	0.204943381295	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.0352883135763	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.404987109072	But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector.
0.0	0.244746266346	Number one, we're going to keep ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.115549594049	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.197578774699	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.113970250131	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.337939785852	If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
0.0	0.522887491256	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.250621567894	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.374455500377	They like to ask direct questions.
0.0	0.0174324316474	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.0588132989061	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.0771565828153	It's great to be at Trump Tower.
0.0	0.267416213877	Border security has always been a part of that debate.
0.0	0.0782255786196	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
0.0	0.049841597214	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.620009714386	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.0464856927693	My point is this.
0.0	0.246762157358	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.153896764967	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.0674973974322	You learn that threats always change.
0.0	0.0608791679855	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.219474679564	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.124626857445	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.17778413387	Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country.
0.0	0.365381131575	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.103736615206	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.160687091815	It's not about Donald Trump.
0.0	0.906986256526	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.399043108829	He's actually a negative force.
0.0	0.783605409678	But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
0.0	0.272624822457	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.12316692279	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.00755176976514	...Chris...
0.0	0.645462060439	Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.
0.0	0.553586523004	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.254313682204	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.211021148629	As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.
0.0	0.00859897594446	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.382749802083	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.642200513824	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.10589733317	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.163756096714	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.327591788904	Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.337318096561	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.575168539299	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.0617488909293	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.686156362562	That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
0.0	0.0365227037789	I love China.
0.0	0.272575239392	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.114140375842	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.269091433967	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.0112758239859	Yeah.
0.0	0.700152612996	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.
0.0	0.368398983848	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.855902354881	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.18171500831	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.488390751455	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.482632679186	The administration originally said 10.
0.0	0.0480178187294	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.068300449737	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.209136400954	These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy, and our economic power in alignment with our principles.
0.0	0.0622433656816	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.0576305331441	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.420031101285	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.0937008621592	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.142737555963	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.
0.0	0.22517785995	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.0977794573716	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.371263973308	Quite likely, for that reason.
0.0	0.363438583843	You can go to my website...
0.0	0.147665215547	That's crony capitalism.
0.0	0.226550582671	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.0877374903507	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.0352886601788	I gotta do it, Dad.
0.0	0.195282157276	...
0.0	0.673114138484	Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage.
0.0	0.0567352004559	And we do have a role in this.
0.0	0.480489712934	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.195833897857	It is.
0.0	0.294084531631	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.364822069605	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
0.0	0.0158885493884	He's very charming.
0.0	0.205295475172	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.
0.0	0.57434421167	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.164461492389	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.355262570115	Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
0.0	0.739147866755	And then on top of that, we've got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are pouring huge sums of money into super PACS heavily influencing the political process.
0.0	0.194415417471	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.106717967994	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.201267994554	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.332192447186	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.126624714345	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.36820752518	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.524933946409	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.472077137257	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.
0.0	0.637658285877	And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity.
0.0	0.335086850017	From top to bottom.
0.0	0.199618739385	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.566607799601	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.0849027931498	I have a wonderful family.
0.0	0.245562822065	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.0495107681574	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.195833897857	It is.
0.0	0.706612266293	In fact, American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the National Institute of Health and that we then tested through the FDA.
0.0	0.23320215238	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.332918334641	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.0461405618394	They serve in the military.
0.0	0.388540616169	Support community banks and credit unions.
0.0	0.0330509998991	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.329587618526	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.0436704444518	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.594652511838	Since, you know, the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody.
0.0	0.156749226024	Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face.
0.0	0.313913654525	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.28704088237	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.150236270315	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.426793434436	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
0.0	0.473255130132	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.00543573488899	Whoa.
0.0	0.252150750721	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
1.0	0.163968795803	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.0107879830575	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.250909739408	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.434361016026	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.678146176531	But bottom line now, is in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or her family.
0.0	0.224536152738	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.123540478191	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.256628562319	And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country.
0.0	0.116911440903	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.398063867738	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.182314962121	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.259855719226	It certainly does cover it.
0.0	0.348235525503	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.058398605871	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.261875186218	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.310841734322	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.318686635073	Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world.
0.0	0.386303730982	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.345535207093	... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience.
0.0	0.0853812809204	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.463071985987	The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.
0.0	0.676758535449	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.111678036138	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.198422949196	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.202529609273	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.408256285293	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.035039713937	Everybody should.
0.0	0.739476614556	She's the senator from New York.
0.0	0.724105384749	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.12265374469	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.281616248611	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
1.0	0.803567034311	Nancy, the blueprint in Maryland that we followed was yes, we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment.
1.0	0.706769934645	You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small.
0.0	0.532063595556	It was the most highly sought after -- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
0.0	0.745884107462	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.243002731514	You've got to go the extra mile.
0.0	0.0694101913951	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.597722408923	They're controlled fully -- they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
0.0	0.347419972562	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.0376199034482	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.52189569146	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.123337143147	And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.
0.0	0.195833897857	You did.
0.0	0.321817054189	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.492108389916	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.0450515614364	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.346374224196	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.182818004109	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.196386816852	What do we do?
0.0	0.136205237454	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.210049503444	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.455806922199	He was putting his 10 and 12-year-old boys to bed the other night.
0.0	0.309824112307	This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.
0.0	0.0849847997123	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.332153048828	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.323457897047	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.0425711558574	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.205659314055	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.308383471593	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.154039638916	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.61021998186	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.551459655877	He invoked mine as well.
0.0	0.153957237411	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.369173528413	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.253222935814	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.507221754669	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.307457185458	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.28918013668	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.151327393687	And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016.
0.0	0.363269707846	There were parts of that bill which agree with parts -- I disagree.
0.0	0.0203879474677	They're off to China.
0.0	0.246436355987	We actually did it.
0.0	0.268500375454	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.191201377914	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.379825588976	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.
0.0	0.268597450814	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.0999355324572	You have to lead.
0.0	0.0862276477167	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.
1.0	0.75460634219	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.111961509586	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.511336805097	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.164896802809	How can you get people to vote for you?"
0.0	0.274266594259	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.0957749789351	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.474617772621	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.567774824807	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.319374397119	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.048157287316	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.0443664280545	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.00402941924169	The mentally ill?
0.0	0.875854230456	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.673492354056	Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
0.0	0.1840781628	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.0507004783403	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.0220067783686	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.0743576081566	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.0491941605378	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.202781810388	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.386318446287	And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.0762074044573	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.275888742925	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
0.0	0.82530684704	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.0923333989262	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.315658536409	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.258982211447	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.136494348442	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.273733246595	I think we need major reform in the military, making it more cost effective, but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us.
0.0	0.253697017333	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.360295780419	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.413130943973	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.201411465486	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.255211645981	And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.536093926213	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.236988708504	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.0619346574327	That's what should be done.
0.0	0.07663286441	It's not working.
0.0	0.20818954763	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.
0.0	0.413078233973	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.0120528266932	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.214210659777	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.461634212343	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.0215267768709	They know.
0.0	0.291724890083	I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.
0.0	0.0210536802577	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.195557880291	No.
0.0	0.225241946174	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.0903997743763	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
0.0	0.0101520600493	I really am.
0.0	0.433788164501	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.256372220927	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.123489046876	I'd like to offer a...
0.0	0.012010687143	Don't know that.
0.0	0.907372991694	... saying, no middle class tax raises.
0.0	0.541216205736	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
0.0	0.757851461617	I was for legalization.
0.0	0.238462431361	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.200870144713	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.799584455983	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.946403059395	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.652367455235	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.0398997089232	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.144078324606	But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble.
0.0	0.389322124631	Marco opposed this because they made a deal.
0.0	0.336503585359	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.111007807298	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.088600994267	Both served.
0.0	0.880017509393	Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.
0.0	0.38382945587	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
0.0	0.431648016646	This is not a conflict where we send in the third divisions of Marines.
0.0	0.051175248352	And he'll say, "Please, please, please."
0.0	0.691276013313	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.0840123187929	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.317532109901	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.321409182091	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
1.0	0.989206845914	Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.
1.0	0.957262998746	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.00940091391191	I'll do it.
0.0	0.10010084394	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.223370951927	Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.
0.0	0.313349864053	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
0.0	0.10987645238	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.195557880291	Both.
0.0	0.275375255602	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.694111846247	Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.
0.0	0.0937298141254	If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.
0.0	0.537137990534	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.0883178991044	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.0242503770935	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.229393201212	It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
0.0	0.0169217697634	We are not France.
0.0	0.142392710784	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0560751438882	So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there.
0.0	0.296570568559	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
0.0	0.147402458116	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.091140822301	So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.
0.0	0.110519623789	Yes.
0.0	0.160608269104	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.0928972209568	Well, there are so many, I don't know where to start.
0.0	0.211585475394	Making fun of disabled people...
1.0	0.164226154039	A lot of people up there can't get jobs.
0.0	0.520416620979	Check it out.
0.0	0.147665215547	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.22033088771	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.078292857977	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.385036202872	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.049100664267	I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country.
0.0	0.689086497507	But accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000.
0.0	0.297832437463	And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.
0.0	0.0481133947025	I think it's a two-pronged issue.
0.0	0.105522250499	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.20281401744	The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders.
0.0	0.10040094995	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.168353379101	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.450904373005	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.508513159762	This is absolutely absurd.
0.0	0.208359104143	I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
0.0	0.184507225732	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.
0.0	0.0626938894323	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.0388312525021	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.266348488691	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.295114062324	So, I thank you very much for that.
1.0	0.999993350576	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
0.0	0.0732914846204	And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.
0.0	0.0997052690113	You want to know what carpet bombing is?
0.0	0.177652116849	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.374040264699	Donald Trump, for example -- I'm glad -- I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him...
0.0	0.0439577058039	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.173552217413	There's too much -- it's like -- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
0.0	0.236575712469	How does that help us?  TRUMP R 15 94 1 N Where is that good?
0.0	0.99593590281	$1 billion a day.
0.0	0.392618230754	But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.
0.0	0.196242237035	That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable.
0.0	0.493978158643	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.300463636593	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.0557396199969	He said, "I can't get it into China.
0.0	0.198364990286	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.163390459664	We ought to send used equipment, right?
0.0	0.275859776687	I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie.
0.0	0.273739999454	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.0137595709541	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.183632181755	As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election.
0.0	0.142017042902	Now, our country needs -- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
0.0	0.219301082848	I never said that.
0.0	0.0209486643721	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.782784987226	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.626276631833	But I went further than that.
0.0	0.191485737487	One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this, is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations.
0.0	0.119157614242	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.250875704251	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.371584287993	None of that information was looked at.
0.0	0.243240505129	That is our government today.
0.0	0.146379655433	We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
0.0	0.596434813705	And I apologize to nobody for that.
0.0	0.282913326346	... First of all -- Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.238560767396	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.227057846957	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.440278940794	But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.
0.0	0.286339334478	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.432691684511	I spent a lot of time in the situation room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us.
1.0	0.924795487401	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.0409630785995	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.776944860048	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.0480615937222	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
1.0	0.999981801996	When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.
0.0	0.519525919112	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.0952489572116	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
0.0	0.516751474517	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.176646578281	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.143577738695	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.887349356008	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.11771668252	I would just say that...
0.0	0.193426747705	And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.
0.0	0.0300067096868	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.284249923125	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.431228796074	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.
0.0	0.365783230538	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.391250894429	This is a complicated issue.
0.0	0.152484150705	Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild.
0.0	0.216225838068	There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
0.0	0.441976667847	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.
0.0	0.0669932531613	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.436505629957	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.203123819742	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.041816449519	We can build the fence.
0.0	0.0376072251958	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.394506235167	They've advertised that.
0.0	0.461876719254	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.615600012416	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
0.0	0.898024951265	And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.10446553201	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.
0.0	0.14267194029	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.0655201040663	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.080483284249	If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen.
0.0	0.262953075885	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.162695711164	I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.
0.0	0.181568558422	We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America.
0.0	0.427993253299	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.203021777726	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.286613553559	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.
0.0	0.0355185137147	I tell you that.
0.0	0.146139775133	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.0754208980837	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.916902779953	All through the recession, we defended the highest median income in America and the second highest median income for African American families.
0.0	0.882327412556	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.129869365102	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.0295918250336	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.0470072668613	Let me...
0.0	0.024214666692	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.189149034583	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.610278465298	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.516893806076	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.257330197203	Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe.
0.0	0.083250958047	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.0352878267238	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.20817095159	That is abundantly clear.
0.0	0.652963468452	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.987140026587	We defended the highest median income in the country.
0.0	0.134144723725	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.244665848055	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
1.0	0.999999997157	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.445545007254	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.358770509473	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.234803783593	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.885709666609	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.241273229517	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.180276265968	This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.
0.0	0.964723920719	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.07647765314	Look, the secretary is right.
0.0	0.36578718444	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.
0.0	0.0405640700821	We saw a dictator overthrown.
0.0	0.62163943744	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.115048127892	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.479276358099	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.419786507373	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.16800109896	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.
0.0	0.132268193333	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.730748194698	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.435562578405	So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.
0.0	0.285756836444	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.436956700462	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
1.0	0.982994885157	I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians.
0.0	0.107639637103	You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying.
0.0	0.195557880291	But...
0.0	0.125506821772	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.155201824267	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.236832890947	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.127510170971	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.298654634813	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.332284311612	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.0505206487279	They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.
0.0	0.713639038559	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.2203082104	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.00208357242694	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
0.0	0.518806234483	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.380751670669	Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.
0.0	0.464991699902	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.00107520205909	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.0211481718662	That is why we need to make...
0.0	0.159468414944	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.369839372053	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.105645259077	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.183102160602	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
0.0	0.288063717861	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.116261199924	... ground and air.
0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.
0.0	0.826064099221	We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
0.0	0.683106642376	There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction.
0.0	0.0706777948534	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.10316032753	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
0.0	0.111845761801	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.00435116580544	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.130582966017	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.27562787925	The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.
0.0	0.21968327424	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.349995496389	I think the issue here is -- and I applaud Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.160769889201	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.592137541488	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.347361014187	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.623154835179	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.165180081588	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.263094224186	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.205526401891	And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
0.0	0.919627463992	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.0514811213049	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.0751921449761	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.0226283070977	That's really nice.
0.0	0.115023789504	Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk.
0.0	0.339643480562	But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
0.0	0.0266635813921	That's right.
0.0	0.170881347557	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.13254840899	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.372445877611	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.451845258839	So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years -- you know, we're at $8 trillion now.
0.0	0.217846309726	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.0103230531266	How would we act?

0.0	0.115886184293	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.558499435039	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.592251913489	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.

0.0	0.0598117445679	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.161438448309	The big banks--
0.0	0.075184211837	I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.
0.0	0.101555290266	Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid.
0.0	0.284229427168	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.
0.0	0.432116193367	He's the one that did Bergdahl.
0.0	0.139987718244	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.681396397856	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.23627124743	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.21587011638	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?

0.0	0.0923239237567	But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.0239763531763	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.181209644119	Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple.
0.0	0.387923921811	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.297359421329	We should be supportive of that effort.
0.0	0.196377560607	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.387259408094	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.51195091209	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.282857281026	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.248923698394	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.934850053723	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.481505109025	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.

0.0	0.143086290438	Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.
0.0	0.151916640368	We got nothing but problems.

0.0	0.202321188508	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.546999536196	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.06608939041	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.

0.0	0.114358363904	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.0851906974591	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.215068159836	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.

0.0	0.0159491700187	We're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.486495250231	So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again.
0.0	0.169440826295	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.189255916005	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.18874670802	We are doing both at the same time.
0.0	0.316559340552	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
0.0	0.367271360497	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.0761029760585	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
1.0	0.909138299702	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.207719505962	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.78678633574	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.931402940101	You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56 percent, equivalent to 56 percent of the GDP In America.
0.0	0.0255698727902	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.202915923709	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.319598166739	And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow.
0.0	0.0906531734868	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.0964203636883	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.176450564713	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.682632143627	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.89082997029	Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts.
0.0	0.083363960094	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.

0.0	0.152965648038	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.285296116292	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.658370392228	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.0613603717249	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.721773832276	I was mentioned in the question.
1.0	0.240922002835	And some of them are like third world countries.
0.0	0.34018974774	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.600271069703	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.386076042688	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.414607223711	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.290470752766	Who are we kidding?
0.0	0.333478948209	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.00969356392421	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.236971512082	I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.
0.0	0.465025750041	... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.
0.0	0.0636025721698	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.363003153679	You bet they do.
0.0	0.126319752675	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.227019874827	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.0213364099144	It's nice.
0.0	0.0409916421631	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.

0.0	0.192368625953	It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York.
0.0	0.235095638457	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.
0.0	0.0112758239859	Yeah.
0.0	0.334096023052	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.5	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.124594116591	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.0636259027265	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.0624831522132	And I watch the speeches.
0.0	0.021182464091	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.195833897857	But what...
0.0	0.335533712961	(APPLAUSE) They're trying to prevent people from registering to vote.
0.0	0.860048916583	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
0.0	0.110519623789	Yes.
0.0	0.511284529709	You know, on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign, I was in Keene, and I was asked what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?
0.0	0.0941461040957	Bret, we're just starting.
0.0	0.0562822684097	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.0216398294058	We know about the Belgians.
0.0	0.800607023185	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.233780031964	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.618645887876	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.226553741432	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.26234359495	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.169103822322	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.241493717478	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.125575157727	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.162154436453	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.0216020799698	And you know what?
0.0	0.559171742881	I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
0.0	0.101692076561	I said no.
0.0	0.144655682589	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.431050913839	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.00916159937275	We don't need that.
0.0	0.00535624263082	It is a disaster.
0.0	0.343215291713	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.0943247561637	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.0890718698002	And that is what we have done in Ohio.
0.0	0.116252839732	Just get me a job.
0.0	0.113628884604	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.234232276954	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.
0.0	0.64104005854	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
0.0	0.187165631138	They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do.
0.0	0.0996399139045	I just want a job.
0.0	0.306261793105	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
0.0	0.0210219616153	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.0810006694768	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.0415940641526	Well, sure.
0.0	0.744029765999	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
0.0	0.0477601201505	He was vibrant.
0.0	0.233257736117	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.842445691736	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.0797001007064	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.231088204978	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.530938254854	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.237658789909	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.054329104015	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.203377503173	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.41304129588	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.559980769849	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.250243199424	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.0275136269492	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.172872716289	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.653071103065	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.310909953192	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.219982846967	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.0797688847898	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.070382616399	But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.
0.0	0.447327731619	And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.
1.0	0.794139234073	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.589877510062	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
1.0	0.90287731804	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.219531189999	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.0317304330776	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.179951420731	And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.
0.0	0.306044204126	Well, thank you, John.
0.0	0.0589220328391	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.113621955464	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.141498401374	You want one?
0.0	0.956821392277	I released 34 years of tax returns...
0.0	0.406812265782	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.286076385299	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.0315596176124	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.224629882812	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.133116393068	We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.
0.0	0.357950436547	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.0766282110368	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.385573052711	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.29365699536	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.697153982323	Just for the record.
1.0	0.975965867545	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
0.0	0.195634733533	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.162265089841	Absolutely.
0.0	0.35792125608	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.471973745587	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.308301986649	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.206154040888	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.0413189064348	DICKERSON: A question from Kathie Obradovich.
0.0	0.240309576909	We have a lot of work to do, to better prepare our nation and to better lead this world into this new century.
0.0	0.423481846692	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.139525987513	And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition.
0.0	0.750285225336	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.110492417183	You can change your mind.
0.0	0.0279833794899	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.44655039872	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.174398465544	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.250100635153	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.0412100832169	I will be ready.
0.0	0.192876290039	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
1.0	0.527133507019	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.118599470999	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.108110633546	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.133857298568	So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
0.0	0.0742928367227	Let me say this.
0.0	0.567545714373	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.0621916724731	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.907524370305	But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.
0.0	0.955404402714	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...
0.0	0.142675052672	Well, I've got news for you, we can.
0.0	0.754416026859	You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.
0.0	0.037569737983	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.245764906355	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.317525380106	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.0865147805307	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
1.0	0.237786250296	They're bringing crime.
0.0	0.227886590134	So, your original question is the right question.
0.0	0.928357279565	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.203114707517	There are hundreds of things like that.
0.0	0.389794845043	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.024191272743	We all understand that.
0.0	0.921821342161	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.336082307156	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.92692936919	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.0873153527921	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.0910406448609	Wait a minute.
0.0	0.275157454403	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.0212194863071	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.1048679503	And the answer is: Because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda.
0.0	0.135387732712	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.186391464749	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.0593642413795	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.839442149569	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.238089855325	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.814033544043	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.350127966451	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.741846282012	I introduced...
0.0	0.113211853057	And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.
0.0	0.130915133126	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.0774239056256	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.061771255346	And we do have to form a coalition.
1.0	0.68176293008	Today, we have 272.
0.0	0.152790239099	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.227002344498	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.122550709789	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.381454067189	That's a hard road to walk.
0.0	0.19611021003	No -- no...
0.0	0.128129000932	And, here's what she said to the American people.
0.0	0.300885952055	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.999997822227	$24 trillion.
0.0	0.296951910078	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.201843751511	As governor, we continued to work together.
0.0	0.147058357464	Well, I would just repeat that.

0.0	0.114165927902	And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
0.0	0.290679497085	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.215287307258	Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare?
0.0	0.145573421351	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.0934648325453	Enough said.
0.0	0.262833384199	We went after those who had attacked us.
0.0	0.0439785809746	I don't think a halt is necessary.
0.0	0.26843089296	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
1.0	0.999995456533	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.298295906558	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.931628037113	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.169975004061	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.222266690642	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.485010571292	We're up 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.00613913226487	Divide that out.
0.0	0.239853534709	I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.
0.0	0.153074887905	And we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.
0.0	0.265412383124	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.368981588685	When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.370783625817	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.215718653042	And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.
0.0	0.39061460318	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.359385544061	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.0172357387665	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.549253634778	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.

0.0	0.201528630374	But I...
0.0	0.140546549709	That is an egregious act.
0.0	0.194969794281	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.04617867904	Jeb, please attack Ted..."
0.0	0.444210310569	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.0750253148372	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
0.0	0.119714062892	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.970295787529	Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.
0.0	0.210966419806	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.505034637478	I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.

0.0	0.145957610125	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.292168184691	Furthermore, in a competitive global economy, it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world.
0.0	0.0691014171939	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.0515522146332	I don't think we're at war with all Muslims.
0.0	0.11732986863	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.403004555496	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.847117828413	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.

0.0	0.0807821658598	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.103265276126	Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.
0.0	0.409267627307	And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.
0.0	0.42011522134	KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.
0.0	0.341058729462	We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress, but it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us.
0.0	0.869285288017	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.25921262342	He's the greatest show on earth.
0.0	0.243825254804	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.19611021003	No, no.
0.0	0.60279220196	Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military.

0.0	0.0157493231959	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.0682233963673	Now, this is getting to be fun.
0.0	0.211139370464	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.0878275900452	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.224690350042	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.0758185226867	They wouldn't be there except for us.
0.0	0.968627902712	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
0.0	0.0689801239555	We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.
0.0	0.376084531488	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
0.0	0.104884246142	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.104401927272	You have a bigger problem with China.
0.0	0.0593023790019	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.0777705363691	I said, "Very interesting."
0.0	0.251246776876	Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.234134385459	When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.
0.0	0.0763396808893	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.144197767702	I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
0.0	0.00771374086335	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.0462942561665	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.0191927614124	Marco, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.195369501575	Good company.... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in -- and I wouldn't even use -- you know, I have -- I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
0.0	0.162265089841	Absolutely.
0.0	0.19732027616	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.176130276845	You know why three?
0.0	0.108818321514	What have you got now?
0.0	0.31083133094	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
0.0	0.341645672285	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.127600764326	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.268867187807	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.016724838271	Then I looked at Rubio.
0.0	0.234555550647	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.271911303784	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.0481386370047	But I would add this.
0.0	0.196663718369	I was not at all.
0.0	0.408415468523	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.358466266056	I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.
0.0	0.123527131607	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.0671779495367	Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done.
0.0	0.245865776217	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.115669876402	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.128249299383	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.165469758014	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.
0.0	0.0746160274147	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.876684298452	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
0.0	0.947969942804	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.333806781546	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.294344625904	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.422675855273	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.166573517797	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.0881597760491	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.368308993229	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.157071847225	But he used to say, "Donald, don't go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.195557880291	These...
0.0	0.0816906314371	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.118394103934	I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.
0.0	0.0508564454513	It really is important that we go forward on this.
0.0	0.105155242278	My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.
0.0	0.0502495184031	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.408662354739	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.201991890332	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.236553924825	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.60491602547	And also -- also, what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health care outcomes are not necessarily that good.
0.0	0.0770339582957	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.658490910835	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.744790918416	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.0778530085141	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.129107846087	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.107753612259	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.134514385644	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.0128423395023	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.350390947538	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.507569897871	She has devoted her life, when I was mayor of the city of Burlington, actually when I first met her, we started a youth office, which started a after-school programs for kids, started a child care center, started a youth newspaper.
0.0	0.424207587077	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.0584988307005	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.0480061395463	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.554842315867	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.178928690976	This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.
0.0	0.194464176497	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.419627034578	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.109395077836	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.230763597123	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.612659587342	We actually passed a living wage.
0.0	0.151866453384	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.160921245004	We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.
0.0	0.308233632674	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.195896187801	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.5	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.0885111789799	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.46192468689	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.684102784067	And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.
0.0	0.110710555056	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.650248678053	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.
0.0	0.050438991484	It's a joke.
0.0	0.440376023313	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.415893593107	John?
0.0	0.194758686782	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.62003191992	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.0573509374561	Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.
0.0	0.0575340482241	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.328821660988	Well, I think it's perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid.
0.0	0.424369980311	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.
1.0	0.308884838725	They just built a hotel in Syria.
0.0	0.402694081411	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.0351531512033	And, look, there are profound differences...
0.0	0.329300630015	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.285270864813	My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves.
0.0	0.205757860682	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.0612654041533	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.0452678260524	I'm an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I miss doing eye surgery, still get to do a little bit.
0.0	0.519134484494	I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.
0.0	0.117927956563	We have got to come forward with a consensus that in fact will work.
0.0	0.203180217752	We are at war with violent extremism.
0.0	0.143883854399	They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn.
0.0	0.0968276817322	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.0905971973353	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.209393747174	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.431420348095	I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader.
0.0	0.208466000564	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.581377489961	Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.
0.0	0.189600421723	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.166931257639	And we also need a cheerleader.
0.0	0.152196111356	I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.138418475413	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.175098385341	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
0.0	0.192438536352	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.16455647969	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.149261548009	But Obamacare kicks in in 2016.
0.0	0.174836522652	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.411882975255	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.00124185063098	Don't do it."
0.0	0.189654524848	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.0112758239859	Yeah.
0.0	0.176391242559	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.334344732032	First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.
0.0	0.884871916928	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.381386604736	The world has changed.
0.0	0.334326090492	But you know what we did in Maryland?
0.0	0.0266171693596	All right.
0.0	0.0669557314287	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.856066915569	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.184688374585	There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out.
0.0	0.00948328128793	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.248124457968	We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
0.0	0.953799422473	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.258702655171	You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes.
0.0	0.221114537782	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.366594916625	When those buildings came down, she was trapped in her building and I didn't hear from her over six hours.
0.0	0.0401610527458	He does great.
0.0	0.444509536278	I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.
0.0	0.177738379987	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.0192303329014	That is important.
0.0	0.14576248321	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.196458653297	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.0265708370962	Right.
0.0	0.222586490373	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.285731601596	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.0921348987764	Did she do a great job?
0.0	0.214699381722	in particular.
0.0	0.0417641038044	So they put together this.
0.0	0.442576630271	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.111809644466	Go ahead.
0.0	0.0827025123161	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.184933592109	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.23840625901	We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...
0.0	0.196663718369	That's what he is.
0.0	0.28880875121	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.00753854574552	Chris?
0.0	0.611839473302	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
1.0	0.92692936919	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.179884452537	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.174608255779	I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?
0.0	0.37435241859	The intelligence was by no means absolute.
0.0	0.0666123767364	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.384766104068	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.164746801782	You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that.
0.0	0.102169454038	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.187265964436	Now, what does that mean?
0.0	0.168503444123	Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond...
0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.
0.0	0.450831600568	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.94970919925	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.400220018569	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.0898802913355	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.0210234157393	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.860067405121	So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.
0.0	0.147716843497	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.00535624263082	It's a disaster.
0.0	0.206121946547	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.5	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.581468812096	But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said.
0.0	0.108040445707	I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s.
0.0	0.0617795393425	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.234151943836	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.141123104807	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.729429691762	Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico.
0.0	0.057627806244	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.0995057266379	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.121579480486	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.195066677459	Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region.
0.0	0.121477582307	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
0.0	0.39851726971	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.0165231030842	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.00412474166656	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.456814988268	In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America.
0.0	0.133214974949	They're killing us.
0.0	0.208089397097	And, you know, I don't know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done.
0.0	0.217829730421	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.825053361862	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.202246527985	Could we have your support?
0.0	0.195813387167	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.20385747522	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.0427467922397	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.321647572886	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.163201296699	And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears.
0.0	0.25317636186	And, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like Gadhafi, a despot with American blood on his hands, is overturned.
0.0	0.128540116496	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.195557880291	No.
0.0	0.23851583205	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.281318420476	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.246582767314	You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.
0.0	0.774716879341	And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.
0.0	0.15991302358	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.0273499649193	We must anticipate these threats before they happen.
0.0	0.0555731874447	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.616314378224	Some of the bravest people that I had the privilege of working with as secretary of state were our development professionals who went sometimes alone, sometimes with our military, into very dangerous places in Iraq, in Afghanistan, elsewhere.
0.0	0.801460379193	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.563685738941	There's never going do be perfect bill.
0.0	0.204597108356	We saw that in Egypt.
0.0	0.122144344046	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
0.0	0.0493610273906	Break them up.
0.0	0.0372346549909	I think there is a consensus.
0.0	0.323266846883	That's calling it what it is.
0.0	0.350172828315	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.887674731615	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.509526464199	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.0922453714529	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.131743574272	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.59007942403	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.0451752675598	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.689886911024	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
0.0	0.458605586742	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.356782387814	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.841487453997	My daughters went to college on a mountain of bills.
1.0	0.928392203109	$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work.
0.0	0.17083895682	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.154563749445	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.386146797692	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.157329694957	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.0265708370962	Right.
0.0	0.0547511707438	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.184014686701	Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us.
0.0	0.290512378282	It's Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.
0.0	0.395965653603	We have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information.
0.0	0.0455642287337	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.234205759119	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.168369524072	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
0.0	0.0602725945984	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.592950610142	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.226220394091	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.0752975149049	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.0729390850488	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.451042580491	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.21332688067	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.890614585419	Number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own.
0.0	0.0061389053267	I think what is...
0.0	0.342779392658	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.0886784211239	You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.
0.0	0.42968349827	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.110662165007	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.114968246293	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.33695411565	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.399069624219	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.199586913539	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.269634744561	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.208970680386	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.782566914487	I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.
0.0	0.060598042244	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.512521520704	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.846095306431	Why is it that we are spending per capita far, far more than Canada, which is 100 miles away from my door, that guarantees health care to all people?
0.0	0.205350189974	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.346340237637	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.29643293894	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.118182340926	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.525174681235	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
1.0	0.436284943327	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.13642103871	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
0.0	0.512273692549	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.849460296822	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.622265978819	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
0.0	0.0364630000999	When I'm president, that will change.
0.0	0.312249089045	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.359188462328	Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.
0.0	0.0513274006582	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?
0.0	0.272162262845	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.257420035368	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.14426201216	Ted can change his mind.
0.0	0.469659049505	I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.
0.0	0.190831541233	And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe.
0.0	0.280142656546	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.197640738775	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.526955336827	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.664912702862	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.208751919694	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.
0.0	0.114676004709	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.693613909013	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.00526104009616	... issues they have to respond to.
0.0	0.26312162957	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.153562708438	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.195282157276	...
0.0	0.470655604982	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.11875189694	And a lot of people are doing that.
0.0	0.437317761402	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.984471346051	We increased education funding by 37 percent.
0.0	0.231936304815	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.188878537948	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.953724284418	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.0697856736843	We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists.
0.0	0.918489754601	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.82545541105	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.
0.0	0.178984009367	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.270954647	Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves.
0.0	0.427678523733	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.225340361559	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
0.0	0.204063774962	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.0061389053267	They think they are.
0.0	0.579433406403	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.0693095375895	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.0616138257321	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.175213145374	Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS.
0.0	0.263935219404	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.154004874441	We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.
0.0	0.54148819697	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.351935864957	That's true.
0.0	0.553199778289	I'm not using the lobbyists.
0.0	0.0425735240497	We need -- we need somebody -- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.
0.0	0.220548607561	And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.406569578799	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.616780074315	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.189207327093	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.078014083695	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
0.0	0.195282157276	...
0.0	0.346727337908	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.274751030421	We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.
0.0	0.297548279848	You have all of these disastrous airports.
0.0	0.19611021003	No their not.
0.0	0.0671189599113	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.0800752703408	That's the good news.
0.0	0.0667584464375	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.028186305729	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.37998363107	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.451335826698	And I was determined to do everything that I could to make VA health care the best in the world, to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending.
0.0	0.469867864371	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.271687651782	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.129838120212	And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave.
1.0	0.988871178163	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.230932540287	She said the truth.
0.0	0.165739686711	Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.
0.0	0.0676354999637	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.5	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.0102994877442	Sure did.
0.0	0.144828102174	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.199549296798	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
1.0	0.984165428188	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
0.0	0.668856186417	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.755474012222	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.442455961652	I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.
0.0	0.14377946812	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.306932181513	So I believe that, in fact, this country needs to move towards a living wage.
0.0	0.0477585973454	That is the issue.
0.0	0.55770817427	And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.
1.0	0.935793405809	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.0137376056019	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.0356297184916	...Thank you.
0.0	0.494713594928	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.216722987856	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.251580286225	Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values.
0.0	0.424105092545	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.
0.0	0.0403001300742	It's not great again.
0.0	0.16107133441	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
0.0	0.132283224727	We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
0.0	0.5	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.45528728225	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.0476396383388	They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists.
1.0	0.893264359951	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.0824908469827	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.328642008306	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.348498533382	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.368608837986	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.534451661108	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.0862048162968	It is going to be amazingly destructive.
0.0	0.186303478072	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.239567104887	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.539724922363	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.404597271707	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.658017578841	We can end welfare for those here illegally.
0.0	0.187936733972	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.0707631356034	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.339420479486	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.243114613348	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.39571116377	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
1.0	0.309000442303	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.179991214511	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.354151847469	On two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago.
0.0	0.453312263794	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.314838424395	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.193057371533	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.182162746115	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.00653163939801	I won't be doing that.
0.0	0.130941819451	You're simply not.
0.0	0.107206583673	We have people that aren't smart.
0.0	0.0327465857692	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.00600726258329	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.195557880291	No.
0.0	0.317559159775	... and say there is something more important than money.
0.0	0.70087301135	And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals -- the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
0.0	0.42446258014	I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done.
1.0	0.574848787382	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.129480793477	Terrorism in this country scares everyone.
0.0	0.217980904633	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
0.0	0.108671848458	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.690007977375	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.0896436332595	And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.
0.0	0.0661407093916	We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.
1.0	0.999999432592	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
0.0	0.216490317442	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.280362045368	But this is what we also have to say.
0.0	0.453537276799	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.934248208185	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.136105493852	You learn to create feedback mechanisms.
0.0	0.200071153416	The formula is working.
0.0	0.45056341499	We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force.
0.0	0.305711922548	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.0179929970469	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.437528320429	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.04910976437	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.051734646534	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.21525962058	And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.
0.0	0.462059806965	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.0714076991194	I'll say this.
0.0	0.230644939691	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.10533941817	His family certainly believes that.
1.0	0.994823023432	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
0.0	0.290254054687	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.310180948067	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.
0.0	0.0767770489413	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.129991607617	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.375267205737	First of all...
0.0	0.344986596319	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.252598066641	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.0431351432987	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.39328004876	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.0220067783686	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.0516226386729	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.222520502978	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.141915163977	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.272251926612	The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court?
0.0	0.478346150662	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.0112758239859	Yeah.
0.0	0.141037063722	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.251377181998	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.0564746808417	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.246129006235	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.366617112741	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.212213955105	Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees.
0.0	0.424839726173	This is what's made our nation so special.
1.0	0.999999999994	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.276625169146	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.
0.0	0.17935398564	They're sending us not the right people.
0.0	0.632523823704	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.392768073451	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.348145041044	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.0894196206491	That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.
0.0	0.249275766469	I've done an amazing job.
0.0	0.760711933806	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
0.0	0.370905091725	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.08621146934	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.1965197603	You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now -- it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run.
0.0	0.243303977517	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.124469221338	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.320169391408	I started off -- thank you -- I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said -- and I love my father.
0.0	0.0711342639453	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.316217697458	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
1.0	0.950384180817	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.368812007884	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.681324952915	I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.
0.0	0.5	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.192361746003	And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.
0.0	0.130794604262	Listen, we can solve immigration.
1.0	0.811294944846	The Republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times.
0.0	0.162889401194	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.246436355987	But actually I am.
0.0	0.0804487587981	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.435573106623	Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...
0.0	0.940022067088	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.103585839389	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.185072770391	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.358657501946	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.119226995791	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.295033230936	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.3231387274	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.511746593563	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.0395243694656	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.018719872475	No vision at all.
0.0	0.19611021003	It's not.
0.0	0.676678477973	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.0192834738558	I think he is right.
0.0	0.0284424380827	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.483176908982	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.42122416338	A lot of the rights that have been won over years, from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights, will be at risk.
0.0	0.0665831827219	I do not believe in unilateral American action.
0.0	0.213042521903	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.671333883542	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.313355701844	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.949924409762	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.0454647915453	No, I love them.
0.0	0.00601540395792	We can't.

0.0	0.0620963437566	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.796774658288	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.127547690048	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.178887212747	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.0466267436699	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.307094664747	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.468490223754	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.0640937783428	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.461980484207	With all -- with all due respect...
0.0	0.0516078260722	We need a collaborative approach.
0.0	0.285965049921	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.427207223046	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.346408715643	The Libyans turned out for one of the most successful, fairest elections that any Arab country has had.
0.0	0.200645328835	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.31516232533	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.635594638069	I am proud that I was the first member of Congress to take Americans over the Canadian border to buy breast cancer drugs for one-tenth the price they were paying in the United States.
0.0	0.165994356256	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.431075847607	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.
0.0	0.197441460971	They can provide resources.
0.0	0.0533111053316	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
1.0	0.999995748413	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.26665562425	He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments.
0.0	0.423622557383	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.177376766864	So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.
0.0	0.201232252785	She did it for convenience.
0.0	0.362123015307	Our country is in serious trouble.
0.0	0.237592622131	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.310543235018	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.694930937394	I think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12 it would be the highest historical average we've ever had.
0.0	0.171709474721	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.0794513998543	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.0291899657226	Talk about what?
0.0	0.0670457930604	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.0901794756038	There are thing that can be done.
0.0	0.261492004883	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.467796260712	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.138878305383	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
1.0	0.983365381799	It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate.
0.0	0.552881436108	And we've got to do more on equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.0358348717407	They won't accept it.
0.0	0.0637286332123	And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.
0.0	0.147970772146	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.162792130553	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.181241778776	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.397819605765	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	0.45645886251	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.115265514372	Well, I just want to quickly add...
0.0	0.214296092694	Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.
0.0	0.104806024134	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.374828748193	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.224358791917	We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.
0.0	0.136093621949	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.24503650773	It has too much economic power.
0.0	0.122188345307	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.
0.0	0.978715405648	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.25773342326	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.129122098964	They are ripping us.
0.0	0.659548245841	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.171311862504	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.0991758960708	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.126609470469	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.0861676589141	Then (inaudible)...
0.0	0.225839651678	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.708235601316	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.0276973454157	Didn't just happen.
0.0	0.0803296209824	That's what the political revolution is about.
0.0	0.591316203063	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.13389777308	In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
0.0	0.17713499524	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.683842574487	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.0257925100697	I know how hard it is to build coalitions.
0.0	0.178966283751	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.207649234822	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.269823000985	That is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.
0.0	0.421405670111	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.163940667832	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.115380357929	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.993044109624	$5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.866529852663	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.34590066118	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.206723562191	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.5	All of us want equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.929356789104	It is not because of the tax writeoff.
1.0	0.999989950406	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.167532308061	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.5	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.0554437790382	Let me get a chance to respond.
1.0	0.981389607658	Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.
0.0	0.661095184802	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
0.0	0.463417719749	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.109421516352	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.
0.0	0.851838815054	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.278311003508	I want immigration reform to pass.
0.0	0.285697390373	I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video.
0.0	0.117291954521	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.41138160147	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.272103159974	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.511843403441	... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.0216776442471	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.0307092401033	Fine, I'll take it.
0.0	0.24497356701	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.121843509995	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
1.0	0.999999967087	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.
0.0	0.107376337022	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.0226620977763	It is a tragedy all over this country.
0.0	0.0422346538304	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.132113608682	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.
0.0	0.196940914627	How do we do it?"
0.0	0.38617809313	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.569506060515	But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
0.0	0.0156185619664	I like China.
0.0	0.0784271835322	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.0153347014835	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.828235142754	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.204604851741	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.0156056159591	You know, the situation is this.
0.0	0.285401751625	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
0.0	0.225091080967	You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country.
0.0	0.0357357552416	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.480825044752	And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years.
0.0	0.0847025998681	It's what they call it.
0.0	0.106243311898	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.0596310125711	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.120401511829	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.253708045052	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.793662220055	My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.
0.0	0.276903555681	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.0336527516679	We listen to you and -- and then we act.
0.0	0.388313943518	You do legislation.
0.0	0.210464007355	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
1.0	0.92698201393	In the past he has called him weak.
1.0	0.999999892905	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.0600541249216	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.146849155908	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
1.0	0.903034758774	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.0652002763628	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.225854213382	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.329681398526	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.311041983792	I have a comprehensive, tough plan.
0.0	0.517964888555	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.826542541677	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.0367682138823	That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
0.0	0.0161575963029	I will do that.
0.0	0.155618085061	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.242976182977	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.
0.0	0.106250155851	It's Hillary Clinton.
1.0	0.954171488013	She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.
0.0	0.075667881835	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.695654644621	And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.
0.0	0.108478502812	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.419536151601	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.298819479336	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.140594014849	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.999995430351	So the total is $8,737,540,00.
0.0	0.15974063085	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
0.0	0.134159294054	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.0969015249411	And some, I assume, are good people.
0.0	0.418445014172	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.0680293991	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.0161858850084	I will not do that.
0.0	0.369618253132	Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint.
0.0	0.00612815338862	Think about it.
0.0	0.377336927809	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.0727815444067	... Chris, keep it coming...
1.0	0.960247093792	In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.
0.0	0.094389824084	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.18108468228	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.303995817846	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.119663044308	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.116836110402	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.839237134303	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.693747427315	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.333757901603	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.340169268478	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.544612285219	Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
0.0	0.0193736715293	A step forward.
0.0	0.335776642098	And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion, this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us, and that we stand with them as they have stood with us.
0.0	0.233325024136	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.167224586319	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.
0.0	0.108836322182	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.273985179061	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.
0.0	0.0295403907911	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.336092315947	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.629727500078	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.0800930155535	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.672376897266	States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government.
0.0	0.319293021982	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.0903079578702	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.526583156523	In terms of Wall Street, I respectfully disagree with you, madam secretary, in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth.
0.0	0.162234558969	Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer.
0.0	0.586780521842	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.456488588016	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.115630521027	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.305634968958	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
1.0	0.951910119561	And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
0.0	0.2016525341	And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in.
0.0	0.127773246558	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.441176719077	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.

0.0	0.222312452031	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.
0.0	0.706273638193	And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.
0.0	0.146140702228	We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
0.0	0.189683933702	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.209657388218	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.440099559439	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.

0.0	0.241833145225	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.0707228606831	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.

0.0	0.356063348897	What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS.

1.0	0.965358970529	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.158166962989	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.37667064379	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.

0.0	0.180612268381	So it is difficult.

0.0	0.0387636980845	I do not think it would come to that.

0.0	0.150241055848	I used the tithing analogy.

0.0	0.238397782111	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.0121907088515	No, I think they won't.

0.0	0.2383192578	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.636936772235	So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating, but the highest median income in America.
0.0	0.109032628851	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.431235349786	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.

0.0	0.238478060611	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.347918617961	Here's my promise-- Wall Street representatives will not be in my cabinet.
0.0	0.0399985536698	He was on the board.

0.0	0.067651559086	It -- it doesn't need to be that way.

0.0	0.712289707739	My name was invoked.
0.0	0.162743144543	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.172044516666	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.

0.0	0.29878521699	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.247118962795	So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.
0.0	0.304438344468	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.13046761172	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.307297901363	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.

0.0	0.0245678415705	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.305700793679	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.337217243862	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.362822283145	And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians, who are also flying in that space.
0.0	0.210263800727	But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country.
0.0	0.515707495533	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?

1.0	0.979478801159	Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.
0.0	0.0241070337306	I understand.
0.0	0.13781246647	That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them.
0.0	0.154368150787	That is why we need to make police -- and I speak as a former mayor.

0.0	0.742471583544	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.243593453012	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
1.0	0.893316898613	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
1.0	0.468151059997	Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees -- these are big vehicles -- were left behind for the enemy.
0.0	0.555558559124	We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.
0.0	0.321724735793	And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, "if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed.
0.0	0.740707489472	Of course, you would.
0.0	0.169986733211	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.212057631617	So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
0.0	0.0470212464871	When did we beat Japan at anything?
0.0	0.276923418333	There are no simple solutions.

0.0	0.0955865329957	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.15399959667	But it's a lot safer.
0.0	0.135918289726	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.
0.0	0.943463074467	And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion."
0.0	0.119681877901	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.0930619954731	There's no way he launches 11 attack --

0.0	0.0943878284748	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.18755285875	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.0299056101823	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.123546999388	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.11978191129	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.0131885472856	It won't happen.
0.0	0.184849425856	Nobody.
0.0	0.075488533965	I'd consider it.

0.0	0.552377140884	We have people that are selling this country down the drain.

0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.

0.0	0.55143396215	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.172783743112	I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.
0.0	0.624620941666	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.

0.0	0.100641705636	Find out what I said to Greenspan.
0.0	0.897817341743	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.296630042544	And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.
0.0	0.202355588682	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.

0.0	0.491562663456	That's the secondary issue.

0.0	0.0224017447808	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.112911712729	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.0112436777547	And I'm confident we can do that.
0.0	0.285309195993	And, yes, we are at war with those people.
0.0	0.361429896662	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.0654591801011	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.491677019037	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.385773870591	But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks."
0.0	0.00208935464543	We serve you.
0.0	0.410372757461	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.

0.0	0.312825887899	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.
0.0	0.383477716514	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.
0.0	0.527953596306	And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.
0.0	0.350672914462	If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration.
0.0	0.444613471057	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.
0.0	0.162265089841	Absolutely.
0.0	0.111326296997	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.382171534158	And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.264789312033	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.0339643465075	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.0932514152957	Let's reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.236006118589	Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks -- between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance.
0.0	0.148317636539	And Martha...
0.0	0.0314141128182	But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that.
0.0	0.237754788229	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.220618377916	I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
0.0	0.102654674065	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.473299256223	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.291407461911	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.198501837663	But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
0.0	0.823252898644	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.0387924264969	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.201948841256	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.

0.0	0.294444720961	I guess the one I -- I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after Bin Laden.
0.0	0.219219873721	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.
0.0	0.529998759744	And all over New Hampshire, I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose.
0.0	0.453049148087	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.5	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.0446506350438	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.342941905191	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.159510168649	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.408920404985	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.538930236921	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.0856527771774	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.827797329231	The bill would involve legalization.

0.0	0.44589483397	I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.

0.0	0.716070324451	They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
0.0	0.0476009838852	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.203650558682	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.461218895121	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.278178985576	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.894271441186	I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.177039366174	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.0566761436551	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.390869738163	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.213252710808	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
0.0	0.450350294791	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.00780090462611	I don't think it's gonna happen.
0.0	0.0578593791694	Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down.
0.0	0.320414394471	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.0434870862243	Let it be for everybody.
0.0	0.0348707592537	What about hydroelectric power?
0.0	0.851233175936	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.373010083645	Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.527355290912	There is broad consensus, 92 percent in the most recently poll of Americans want gun safety measures...
0.0	0.265552886779	So protect the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.661831421877	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.397378548404	Now, he's doing better.
1.0	0.999999674766	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.678942530635	We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital.
0.0	0.449150621522	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.385302849983	And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't.
0.0	0.304045799809	Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.466759736242	It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
0.0	0.0379200713081	He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots.
0.0	0.361194109483	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.26763952357	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.216900480731	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.276239230506	They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea.
0.0	0.312771277705	Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform.
0.0	0.217036803273	... we will secure the border...
0.0	0.368439450733	Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.
0.0	0.0579659003478	They're never going to let it happen.
1.0	0.986042884579	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.725168892769	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.399387423569	We need money.
1.0	0.999999998992	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.162889401194	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.169988759527	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.306746038653	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.110519623789	Yes.
0.0	0.615759112977	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.518661786068	We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001.
1.0	0.937341496529	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.113885171777	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.349166796594	No, what I would say is this is look, I was the first of the three of us to call for America to accept the 65,000 refugees we were asked to accept.
0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.
0.0	0.211335887544	People were shocked, Trump got it.
0.0	0.12493167212	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.578231513081	We both made the identical promises.
0.0	0.0267100733277	That is not right.
0.0	0.311603120907	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.322414244233	Two weeks later, the place was blown up.
0.0	0.77010023714	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.526696372212	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.215816369535	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
0.0	0.828997685367	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.184980347078	I'll give you another example.
0.0	0.328015696	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.2185224912	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.
0.0	0.210965186484	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.320737019091	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.311534035399	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.0609848912317	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
0.0	0.153547613557	Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.
0.0	0.081455309303	But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up.
0.0	0.0548229538889	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.20925849624	All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.
0.0	0.247141065731	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.0444947642722	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.189640145746	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.00124185063098	No, they shouldn't.
0.0	0.482902688114	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.0525608563536	Yes, I'm getting...
0.0	0.536275212384	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.381027118557	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.0938385496974	We will do very, very well, very, very well.
0.0	0.436015643072	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
0.0	0.64448838802	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.522398587383	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.962646555486	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.157265216439	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.0226547150182	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.150725442059	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
1.0	0.108326464386	Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.
0.0	0.243296234592	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.647836231045	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
1.0	0.999999891937	And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money.
0.0	0.645415919375	And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.
0.0	0.12083130182	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.127104532159	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.635018656689	I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan.
0.0	0.0361312290215	You get a lot of them that are overrated.
0.0	0.174979480974	First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.197428635589	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.147538982193	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.460623948003	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.420588444815	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.0233024036887	And he is a proud American Muslim.
1.0	0.999984363729	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.902702912913	That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.
0.0	0.211703055592	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.267959154943	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.332329338782	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.155053178475	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.902144354151	You should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition.
0.0	0.229386741516	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
0.0	0.26361252192	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
1.0	0.993339793023	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.751849618831	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.113625981269	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.154074126214	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.412728668179	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.202898046472	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
0.0	0.520092824442	When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.
0.0	0.0594641618225	You just want to...
0.0	0.127592835598	... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before.
0.0	0.404637448056	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.0643774363568	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.278948452147	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.579745253869	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.302318441878	Number two, we had a really good plan.
1.0	0.993121751694	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
0.0	0.126839975721	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
0.0	0.332270217472	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.224960343529	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
0.0	0.49444418808	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
1.0	0.784493259046	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.511953344041	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.138520646819	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.217227708441	End -- end Common Core.
0.0	0.4325760592	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.40063927644	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.351203919577	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.193868229608	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.684615495425	You can go to opensecrets.org and check that.
0.0	0.0212194863071	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.418489229693	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.0175242692507	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.0426676732379	And I think that's a mistake, and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways.
0.0	0.143100015265	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.0267100733277	That's not right.
0.0	0.336927040999	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
0.0	0.076916830649	And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.
0.0	0.128254595161	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.491379202154	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.264393528115	Many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed.
0.0	0.196975687266	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.
0.0	0.130270108568	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.370746628661	Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.
0.0	0.0223587712649	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.678225787399	We have three children, eight, five and one.
0.0	0.0264672062904	Let me respond...
0.0	0.729405590173	And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.
0.0	0.672274907094	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.114738352273	I waited and I got the scars to show for it.
0.0	0.113116873281	I would not want to go to that point.
0.0	0.490168207953	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.
0.0	0.461183573853	You cannot grant amnesty.
0.0	0.194202751534	To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.
0.0	0.216297708161	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.0216020799698	And you know what?
0.0	0.0577629187045	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.54824817108	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.101401608276	We can do that.
0.0	0.525363482398	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.111778718616	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.0601929104759	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.423221939356	They went to the DNC quietly.
0.0	0.295867417021	ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.
0.0	0.284112815089	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.143794710497	She never lived to see that.
0.0	0.554288027596	What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security, through the State Department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening.
1.0	0.94615998115	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.341735856548	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.0558924868567	It is ISIS.
0.0	0.0977216692781	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.178915406313	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.143567721384	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.606332592995	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
0.0	0.0410800050533	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.236346796769	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.262540489314	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.124059843049	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.967791558831	You once had a pension.

0.0	0.7309264419	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.

0.0	0.111176295648	Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.
0.0	0.666378418104	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.

0.0	0.0392688151019	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.64676017462	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.249175160382	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.354771246951	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.

0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.
0.0	0.111402136977	So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.
0.0	0.140847092706	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.214141764715	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.357375244178	Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting...
0.0	0.0127041408024	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.387000864702	But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says.
0.0	0.256514546236	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.302720658288	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.358623179884	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.0499034819212	I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.
0.0	0.615808342519	And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.
0.0	0.674588424967	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.03462680468	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.50980211381	I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of State, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now.
0.0	0.233727978468	I -- I believe that we should make community college free.
0.0	0.212550389472	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.157297648823	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.518006709241	But I agree, as I mentioned a moment ago, with King Abdullah.
0.0	0.492801938232	We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.
0.0	0.263173091209	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.0959346971225	May I have a chance to respond to this issue?
0.0	0.099116748117	...the only reason is -- look...
0.0	0.659860430147	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.
0.0	0.135831284481	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.0201004169689	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.
0.0	0.472797700276	Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it.
0.0	0.234408357679	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.230821118347	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.0385157032658	I'm going to be independent.
0.0	0.0795528219767	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.
0.0	0.344348791474	They are not doing it now.

0.0	0.291634334061	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.0718610165898	They'll all come back.
0.0	0.0216020799698	And you know what?
0.0	0.418548048018	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.

0.0	0.0515208025562	It's not crass.
0.0	0.209563282861	The answer is no.
0.0	0.477632048884	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.0968815191814	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.256397271994	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
0.0	0.180125232937	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.0215267768709	I know.

0.0	0.153980500474	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.

0.0	0.0266635813921	She was right.
0.0	0.888834128233	By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started.

0.0	0.0453184696074	How stupid are our leaders?
0.0	0.332932999894	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.648508715135	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.0959303224224	But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.19756968746	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.0814145371518	Well, I think it's pretty clear that they know that I will.
0.0	0.102844482555	Let me give you the bad news.
0.0	0.538015468053	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.

0.0	0.573069600935	I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war.
1.0	0.983474108265	We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.
0.0	0.0365841972947	Let's keep going.
0.0	0.50601545773	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.141159440747	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
1.0	0.999999633414	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.127621947049	I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.
0.0	0.342632759885	We have one House member from Vermont, three candidates in the race.
0.0	0.060481748934	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.091261680616	All of you in Iowa, I need you to caucus for me.

0.0	0.0588512163108	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.344121374847	And there is a lot we can do in college affordability.
0.0	0.0899376070901	That was a terrible mistake.
0.0	0.405501005309	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.387882449576	Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country.
0.0	0.177502099871	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
0.0	0.734888971142	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.406982343289	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.

0.0	0.176454552619	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.242246211698	The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.

0.0	0.167620392836	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.

0.0	0.421650593582	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.0727695603641	It's making...

0.0	0.111596431691	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.160589660902	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.0146869889873	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.221563542138	But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be looking for new sources of energy.
0.0	0.364863776977	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.157853555032	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.294020867925	Thank you very, very much.

0.0	0.0684842582127	How are these people gonna lead us?
0.0	0.746059988902	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.937669241628	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.249065497009	... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.0229565499379	I don't have to brag.
0.0	0.178900685254	But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn't cut and run.
0.0	0.528883105487	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.251970532068	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.356613494716	I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.

1.0	0.698603698741	John -- John, this country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.596684871213	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.353862685929	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.553547007305	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.24297244474	Come on now.
0.0	0.10447022084	I win.

0.0	0.0193509862779	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.519125456316	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.476510651539	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.0155891430753	Wow.
0.0	0.0944563213134	I'm tested.
0.0	0.181126272524	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
1.0	0.996160380584	This small country has welcomed in many refugees.
0.0	0.476198871414	But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.
0.0	0.251181073864	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.

0.0	0.0436622174982	It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.
0.0	0.308859148979	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.0145715156138	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.0300521279949	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.0696063196901	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.584385646598	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.873763810727	Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system.
0.0	0.0700722243259	The problem is...
0.0	0.467997750445	And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.
0.0	0.428904443215	Paul Volcker, one of the leading lights of trying to reign in the excesses, has also said he does not support reinstating Glass-Steagall.

0.0	0.127145293955	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.630064029067	In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, "what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"
1.0	0.992928295781	Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?

0.0	0.544803277148	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.0208391936087	Believe me.
0.0	0.0616401303266	And I hear their speeches.

0.0	0.354456946938	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.288537830982	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.0285634914514	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.
0.0	0.0317715090758	He can't have it both ways.
0.0	0.399024073108	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.363941128244	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.644588090214	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.28956707704	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.0637605725553	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.0549181754555	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.055541374416	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.0792036601797	They don't even have a chance.
0.0	0.0462912165658	And I think has had a big impact.
0.0	0.368894455622	So I said, "That's OK." I'm proud of my net worth.
0.0	0.143187146319	We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground.
0.0	0.227628642524	She wants to pursue the American dream.
0.0	0.39843608283	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.246154462404	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.360374849813	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.26114494808	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
1.0	0.992972015817	What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons.
0.0	0.194860927988	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.21398454404	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.113281806793	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.204783189317	They're not supporting our law enforcement officers, it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.110464748682	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
0.0	0.127930861557	But they're killing us economically.
0.0	0.327782771265	It's one of the key investments we need to make.
1.0	0.975472282103	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
1.0	0.999999390094	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.223215895132	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.208721604716	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.716822699181	What part is valid?
0.0	0.120492934388	... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
0.0	0.17787701916	We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels.
0.0	0.299161317199	Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem.
0.0	0.355973429604	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.064077140504	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.465357433622	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.0964826341108	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.257854936679	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.358636640234	I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
0.0	0.167834591137	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.0877976421596	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.218202099997	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.556248093175	It means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana.
0.0	0.0669548732016	I think we're at war with jihadists who have --
0.0	0.571086145946	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.940022067088	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.135158149259	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
0.0	0.316536182543	Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens.
0.0	0.328934864815	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
1.0	0.999989374789	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.406909841704	They should be Muslim troops.
0.0	0.413451391973	It was a terrible sight.
1.0	0.950449796895	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.103585839389	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.424876735105	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.0593642413795	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.82737305355	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.114457639356	I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.
0.0	0.132619319416	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.0156437867589	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.185081203863	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.408610621257	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
1.0	0.999997055637	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.399450728132	The DNC has hired vendors.
0.0	0.386768487954	It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.
0.0	0.265258374953	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.136342951188	They were wrong.
0.0	0.124590668231	Say again?
0.0	0.34060634101	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.248451495132	Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top.
0.0	0.238347114543	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.0974629491776	I love this country.
0.0	0.313002786091	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.545308204923	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.1083839821	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.266045929921	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.50505790361	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.107250233743	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.357512204054	Otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.
0.0	0.433816243074	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.236696276046	You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question.
0.0	0.0871803898846	We've got nothing.
0.0	0.168985968848	We also have to build a coalition at home.
0.0	0.62448962688	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.18203751608	We will see what the American people are willing to support.
0.0	0.600066357096	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.

0.0	0.0477215648889	Barack Obama wants to change America.
0.0	0.0644842142174	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.0137837812451	We need to define the enemy.
0.0	0.0446889282876	You're right about that.
0.0	0.0793865888754	... Well, no, no.
0.0	0.0702746557998	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.188215635684	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.442765405515	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.365177065162	I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college.
0.0	0.365486520461	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.

0.0	0.149232133786	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.189734914166	You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.

0.0	0.0265133601148	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.404045833656	It is enormously complicated.
0.0	0.297104709544	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...
0.0	0.954038716745	We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally.
0.0	0.0703287736651	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.223191199063	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.
0.0	0.431239805902	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.0232734415415	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.210914512607	And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives.
0.0	0.334019048919	This country is changing.
0.0	0.0311506242819	And we need to very, very concerned about that.

0.0	0.741581124362	But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.

0.0	0.551990682482	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.240015162566	I don't get any money from Wall Street.

0.0	0.245542708513	If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences.

0.0	0.0611103974426	They can't lead us.
0.0	0.197382676934	We need sound money.
0.0	0.181691729947	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.0146814496962	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.142784515865	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.01203173852	But we don't know.
0.0	0.0958850976628	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.0731848307788	Now the Libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge ISIS from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.
0.0	0.412710883332	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.132472993013	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.249360447361	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
0.0	0.251870280304	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.191085797394	Well, this whole issue concerns me.
0.0	0.656207747873	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.109934544463	I said, "They send it back?"
0.0	0.179902077443	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy.
0.0	0.217734682239	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.0597978964613	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.0475297308172	But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.
1.0	0.259645326625	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.302788334184	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.166672951549	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.216490317442	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.190040138797	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.129619738842	And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.
0.0	0.452470755276	After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the -- the donors and by the lobbyists -- and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero -- I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford.
0.0	0.528209746733	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.768809763856	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.649627724118	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.212239462526	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.493530556711	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.547674806547	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.305666516278	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.0471936099025	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.
0.0	0.178998458189	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.214320302379	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.195557880291	But...
0.0	0.269990552902	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.0714074822419	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.0373011858158	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.393310158459	Yes, this one falls under the category of, I have actually done this.
0.0	0.0291282493571	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.0183475321163	You really can't.
0.0	0.244762953377	And people are saying, "What's going on?
0.0	0.185440821495	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
0.0	0.302181268262	But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.
0.0	0.161523586826	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.0458262024687	Really big league.
0.0	0.334354813796	We have more people in jail today than any other country on earth.
0.0	0.484160221936	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.418989040789	For over 200 years, America's light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again.
0.0	0.0379434844494	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.239606038456	You're seeing cities like San Francisco, cities like Los Angeles doing it, and they are doing it well and workers are able to have more disposable income.
0.0	0.0683970315094	He was a little teddy bear to me.
0.0	0.081641658475	You know, this is not easy work.
0.0	0.368276494548	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.157610976236	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.163713222132	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.145408182007	Well, David, I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country.
0.0	0.13807856122	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.0767170613838	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.322803908699	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.291420910809	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.629202795725	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.0760289940733	Hillary doesn't want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her.
1.0	0.995449360737	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
1.0	0.285269200989	We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
0.0	0.405029686556	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.0645300614405	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.12245601838	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.343172486679	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.237898950752	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.218727577101	It's real estate.
0.0	0.0565535597284	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.221118997902	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.110657978761	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.5	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.92634922761	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.901206426324	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.133166468258	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.0939667854239	I will find -- within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy.
0.0	0.07902215647	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.0681352595255	I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work.
0.0	0.0296344634074	How are we gonna -- how are we gonna go back and make it great again?
0.0	0.282528750992	Sit down with people like John Mccain.
0.0	0.354198361523	We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.
0.0	0.334628610543	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.832242249489	It was an investment bank.
0.0	0.359583024703	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.752559193372	It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English.
0.0	0.405533558791	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.171349847951	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.007225156307	No, I don't think so.
0.0	0.340652411645	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.331342221332	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.270792603838	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.183902368402	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.102020466628	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.256228647582	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.233527701424	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.382289145275	Media notwithstanding.
0.0	0.437698069659	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.0373090505881	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.685505458205	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.63909946429	Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.
0.0	0.0819725803481	That will change everything.
0.0	0.34685204813	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
0.0	0.523019873286	When you ran in 2000, you said that we needed federal robust regulations.
0.0	0.185154555418	Sadly, the American dream is dead.
0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.
0.0	0.0441698768594	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.0449223605025	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.0289246034236	And it isn't because I'm all that great.
0.0	0.306633903134	We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.
0.0	0.232526583901	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
1.0	0.888654212374	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.869999971533	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.0940856284148	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.230963833668	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.354970360105	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.629516831274	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.395563018872	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.111613270602	How has it worked?
0.0	0.419102838489	For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check.
0.0	0.704464930896	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.11251722486	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.0993820265525	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
0.0	0.249707935827	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.202416897085	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.0849901609786	And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.
0.0	0.195557880291	No.
0.0	0.23744924299	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.00496198589984	Look what they did in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.653379388887	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.306089218225	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.213619845351	Because I've seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime.
0.0	0.215035154292	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.371814791956	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.584436009425	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.113621955464	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.125304145251	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.0689886978683	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.453509547308	I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.386851967933	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.711343723212	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.161793686264	... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street.
0.0	0.56240735945	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.398287789435	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.158576494108	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.211354716264	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.0570539758616	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.316979693799	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.552149634482	As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.
0.0	0.547861762975	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.17830922704	We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations.
0.0	0.329678951432	And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent.
0.0	0.0060761669834	OK...
0.0	0.14579086422	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
1.0	0.99487761108	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.0846446450285	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.02945758811	Our next president...
0.0	0.310863588967	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.141700260428	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.139152082077	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
1.0	0.999999999994	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.846659870556	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.061947413524	So you might not.
0.0	0.195557880291	No.
0.0	0.201528630374	And so do I.
0.0	0.511882688085	And it will have effects in the private market.
0.0	0.0060761669834	OK?
0.0	0.022975346962	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.399798953461	Because we need money.
0.0	0.109417578381	He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims -- all Shia Muslims on the planet.
0.0	0.20355443377	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.42784779284	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.360195501766	They're going to take away thousands of jobs.
0.0	0.155268722997	We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground."
0.0	0.279168484629	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.
0.0	0.222739828247	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.370088093514	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.61956624269	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.0727995897218	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.354153161426	And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.133117796185	And I think that's the false choice...
0.0	0.0266171693596	All right.
0.0	0.0410767499568	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.362498053239	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.438721338783	How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years.
0.0	0.353320437199	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.41028789593	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.521416908514	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.172523373454	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.0403224215331	We want to build on it and fix it.
0.0	0.133329605811	Well, let's take it one at a time.
0.0	0.262183539676	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.0813238216738	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.0991055672248	I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.
0.0	0.700890555264	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.156704911602	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.787688066869	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.171194027783	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.195833897857	She did.
0.0	0.125481147919	We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.
0.0	0.0941328664832	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.737685271032	More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows.
0.0	0.0313301636788	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.298675139529	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.0591520052651	So should the UK, so should France.
0.0	0.157659376034	That's the job.
0.0	0.779279507211	I've employed -- I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
0.0	0.0952532900999	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.0729147639901	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.352873187278	There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America.
0.0	0.242000209274	We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
0.0	0.101662244226	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.195282157276	...
0.0	0.191933989385	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.262980035281	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
0.0	0.352904908041	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.0934790695354	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.712654898385	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.148139286904	Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.
0.0	0.626904851329	And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.
0.0	0.139072973519	But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here.
0.0	0.16530320406	This is a terribly complicated issue.
1.0	0.689740847202	The truth of the matter is, net immigration from Mexico last year was zero.
0.0	0.194305618534	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.052887426298	But he wasn't a cheerleader.
0.0	0.133228267171	Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
0.0	0.195282157276	...
1.0	0.964347923853	That's wrong.
0.0	0.132995187005	Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.580862909795	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.740033219025	Of course not.
0.0	0.644924853605	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.207200003274	Yes, exactly, exactly.
0.0	0.145460845674	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.60036748476	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.129367410338	Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.
0.0	0.197382676934	We need sound money.
0.0	0.0934181338119	And for good cause.
0.0	0.174604762402	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.764105201798	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.97537487134	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.494069830468	The list goes on because the differences are so stark.
0.0	0.647179104812	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.304257071141	My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.
0.0	0.165513672879	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.123634613717	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.423503612793	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.295849140693	I would like to see it updated.
0.0	0.0745344030401	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.0729569152957	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.0272310916024	And here's what's going to happen.
0.0	0.375267205737	First of all...
0.0	0.136342951188	He's wrong.
0.0	0.144029815708	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.196663718369	We have to do it.
0.0	0.308385283141	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.260879307947	We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.
0.0	0.458949942917	These are often very long- term kinds of investments that have to be made.
0.0	0.0739449285366	He said, "You know, I make great product."
0.0	0.383501551992	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.122570485243	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.860873441907	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.138939923155	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.110519623789	Yes.
0.0	0.099808492004	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.453597305598	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.950809836142	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.29904945652	A brief response.
0.0	0.277624319505	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.328091165948	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.398432205349	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.213191866087	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.366444494785	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.476047123171	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.0953910328883	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.29624449583	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.164696439741	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.226221002141	So Ford will come back.
0.0	0.275593106415	Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.524115936923	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.300901766854	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.313173393416	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.120460582454	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.195282157276	...
0.0	0.35016562777	Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.
0.0	0.433591094549	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.0358683829141	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.295692209138	In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.0788340641711	And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president.
0.0	0.111983063838	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.0944450602776	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.423361730548	But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.
0.0	0.00349185985915	I feel like...
0.0	0.455201533235	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.
0.0	0.164818076168	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.28397535413	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.

0.0	0.207958153702	It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.
0.0	0.507224527752	You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?
0.0	0.0061389053267	I think that is...
0.0	0.705454861806	Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care.
0.0	0.439167205581	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.116745319012	I've faced it.

0.0	0.0966668361185	We were attacked from Afghanistan.
0.0	0.204217781862	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.

0.0	0.158425997473	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.161428214212	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.235007497587	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.183659735254	I've had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say, I don't agree with you on everything, but I like what you do.
0.0	0.195282157276	...
0.0	0.128950909448	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.489770380893	They're a scam.
0.0	0.201352697304	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.

0.0	0.0772850781734	I'm the only person...

0.0	0.537561210998	If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out.
0.0	0.44655039872	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.

0.0	0.110742785483	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.174277644981	And, you know, I do think it's important to do exactly what Senator Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about, and that they talk to each of us about.
0.0	0.0998478109258	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.205322079548	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.

0.0	0.328769108004	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.

0.0	0.35041253243	We only have one or two.
0.0	0.47458229997	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.170672019221	Is creating much deeper, closer relations and, yes, coalitions within our own country.
1.0	0.626170030445	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.136025514017	And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it.
0.0	0.52562778542	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.421745601443	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.673780807326	We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love -- they're great -- all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.
0.0	0.145275099948	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.385220781402	So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income.
0.0	0.123243064816	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.271648960829	At the same time we're doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform.
0.0	0.962706267278	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.241833145225	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.0443942357644	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.0937008621592	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.429102816407	In addition to that...
0.0	0.158879053643	I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here...
0.0	0.189618267563	David, I am the very first...
0.0	0.328408456277	They come up to my office.
1.0	0.0374027461153	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.0202742473731	I would change them.
0.0	0.167526375221	Secondly, we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.
0.0	0.362428003163	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.165403194029	The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.
0.0	0.306428267448	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.19611021003	Why is it...
0.0	0.232908830402	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.630692814749	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.135197736162	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.47297320722	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.197707004632	And your point is absolutely well taken.
0.0	0.237523970257	I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country.
0.0	0.369214249564	But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it.
0.0	0.150558466096	I think after 11 hours, that's pretty clear, yes.
0.0	0.151891550406	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.235944021162	Well, you've got to be on top of it right away.
1.0	0.150119361093	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.607158026504	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.348952347074	That is some group of people.
0.0	0.369805964365	The United States has, unfortunately, been victimized by terrorism going back decades.
0.0	0.131396518155	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.187248439706	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.487337486878	Reinstating Glass- Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough.
0.0	0.0485882429999	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.962878139046	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.334172559016	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.19611021003	That's it.
0.0	0.111053552897	Now I'm not doing that...I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?
0.0	0.0427353274128	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.703016750582	I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains.
0.0	0.468778331557	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.441911361433	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.528831849487	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.405117683986	In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men.
0.0	0.355725886157	He's weak on immigration.
0.0	0.163381571373	As president, I will support law enforcement and we'll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community.
0.0	0.957095730806	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
0.0	0.957832534601	Fifty-one percent of high school African-American graduates are unemployed or underemployed.
0.0	0.570956142202	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.257418121403	We cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of moral nations around this Earth, we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats, because Martha, this will not be the last region where nation-states fail.
0.0	0.428073045828	and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States.
0.0	0.710312636924	Neil, I was mentioned too.

0.0	0.447670699895	The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans.
0.0	0.0126705154101	And there's a lot.
0.0	0.195557880291	How?
0.0	0.464777196392	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.207712863082	I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support.
0.0	0.177700811684	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.465295258045	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.841536547081	We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations.
0.0	0.172361023508	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.977559282126	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.395540938453	It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act.
0.0	0.00612815338862	Think about it.
0.0	0.252438876583	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.160253201634	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.210144835542	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.898912365672	Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble.
0.0	0.183144497364	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.265720882796	What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria, when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family you'd better get out now.
0.0	0.00123750284703	We haven't.

0.0	0.644316519154	I also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees.
0.0	0.0352498561374	And this summer, we didn't do that.

0.0	0.474050225138	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.0620490231281	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.312225276448	When do we beat Mexico at the border?
0.0	0.110519623789	Yes.
0.0	0.224344306271	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.782674138354	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.00612815338862	Think of it.
0.0	0.397521672037	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.523539401065	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.329716347058	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.745283708541	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.0600108820997	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.0786977498095	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.244457406864	Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.

0.0	0.0540699517636	You don't hear it from anybody else.
0.0	0.289426707272	So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.
0.0	0.994767282325	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.118054504263	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.414621690731	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.0959266804348	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.195626977427	Wall Street today has too much political power.
0.0	0.0977126609611	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.402273365927	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.0690226325396	We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
0.0	0.407576947577	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.467530358369	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.

0.0	0.0215535737471	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.119561068315	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.0265708370962	Right.
0.0	0.107120786976	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.580397444089	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.195802457891	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.195491174971	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.
0.0	0.321540940903	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.

0.0	0.0142316979535	They're not good.
0.0	0.218421521204	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.181417881442	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.
0.0	0.086687012435	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.0694666430359	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
0.0	0.179523330142	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.368946056925	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
0.0	0.0580122255576	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.0445351854094	You're right.
0.0	0.64817627201	It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military.
0.0	0.0399488610954	But you know what else they're anxious about?
0.0	0.095046316508	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.94541506242	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.816587431027	I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil.

0.0	0.26730210899	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
0.0	0.260256295536	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.717911577771	... and 85 percent of gun owners agree.
0.0	0.114270687039	People are upset about it.

0.0	0.0574576525059	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.0791306411552	Well, I did.
0.0	0.208715883675	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.0563958844232	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.228174585148	The answer is yes.
1.0	0.749117317415	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.254819150524	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.

0.0	0.112290347171	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.195932713083	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.358248706683	And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process.
0.0	0.24861541852	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.

0.0	0.403833547284	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.

0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.
0.0	0.826724328092	So it's unfair to say in total...
0.0	0.0570371576458	We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.
0.0	0.139690695263	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.232983813022	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.615572267816	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.408471218802	I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.
0.0	0.912423736476	We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.
0.0	0.0555928024897	I want security.
0.0	0.0973573074257	Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense.
0.0	0.377035000506	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.649929936989	It'll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there's no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.
0.0	0.259621270298	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.240886131869	And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.
0.0	0.0391432480974	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.420574372188	Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
0.0	0.0796216961037	There's a big question mark on your head.
1.0	0.999998829946	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.337218525303	Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone.
1.0	0.323163815047	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.0705306851865	It's not only a problem here.
1.0	0.999981249513	But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.
0.0	0.196663718369	So what do we do?
0.0	0.872401773573	I also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down.
0.0	0.947508882034	We raised the minimum wage.
0.0	0.303171264189	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.0707753938835	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.218814973988	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.342212886621	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.0758536632179	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.254836762793	It will give hope to millions of young people.
0.0	0.119389088187	Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name.
0.0	0.399029661626	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.358917315352	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.0639000357903	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.197341562238	The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world.
0.0	0.387028052061	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.0217685268614	We got it.
0.0	0.131385604039	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.109170070027	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.200598590297	And I mean, are you kidding me?
1.0	0.983390295325	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.014840390235	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.0780313746452	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.189210945066	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.770308193839	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.0977809430805	I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary...
0.0	0.189927346268	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.183759381454	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.273696911613	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.
0.0	0.291426482239	I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism --
0.0	0.790064026752	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.105763135036	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.174376308445	Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."
0.0	0.37882452027	I made it the old-fashioned way.
0.0	0.230453731252	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.551880783543	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.195833897857	And why?
0.0	0.35000345371	I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not.
0.0	0.0794687507501	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.342314455728	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.93297958312	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.0313189561404	I like them.
0.0	0.00320564612617	Those are your enemies.
0.0	0.0340798529453	Just can't happen.
0.0	0.159143283269	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.422656459252	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.516053487936	And in that capacity, I met with just an extraordinary group of people from World War II, from korea, vietnam, all of the wars.
0.0	0.436284943327	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.0521397570503	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.272015212862	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.101415609497	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.0266635813921	That's right.
0.0	0.13111101249	I learned so much.
0.0	0.282597107827	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.10408130963	And Teddy Roosevelt is right.
0.0	0.151047006292	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.0550182634684	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.347286129935	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.220177034662	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.716258050471	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.199527658227	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.187946897964	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.237553200926	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.155389581002	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.475114528958	Go on to my website.
0.0	0.0768801305986	We must keep America safe from this threat.
1.0	0.674018959693	However, what Alan Krueger said in the piece you're referring to is that if we went to $15, there are no international comparisons.
0.0	0.863587226167	I'm one of the 77 percent.
0.0	0.0372348844063	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.
0.0	0.370078581953	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.43908428232	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.290191391989	Or a young woman who had been performing at President Obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member.
0.0	0.130327087216	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.0643840276058	They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.
0.0	0.0402305329592	How great is that?
0.0	0.760242750758	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.99546152182	...income tax...
0.0	0.36829423357	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.0100942175241	I don't care.
0.0	0.87589993619	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.0866214209697	I would just...
0.0	0.00454319606695	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.122307852793	And we have to stop all the divisions.
0.0	0.478023256752	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.158982735226	I would invite him, I actually would say.
0.0	0.218831868323	Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
0.0	0.19091719229	All right, Nancy, I really wish you'd come back to me on this on this one, John...
0.0	0.104363300069	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.599415429097	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.573950523555	Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems.
0.0	0.260609681962	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.248524551727	Let's be frank here.
0.0	0.426748168401	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.405929327004	So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.
1.0	0.999999979863	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.460675288723	In all due respect...
0.0	0.270746094141	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.210229620112	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.5	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.0265133601148	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.728406023091	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.687682964439	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.195557880291	No.
0.0	0.271952301377	And second of all...
0.0	0.136136775032	Well, we did have a plan, and I think it's fair to say that of all of the Arab leaders, Gaddafi probably had more blood on his hands of Americans than anybody else.
0.0	0.0894051403413	Yes, let's tell the truth, Martin.
0.0	0.268949851508	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.0904041980496	I'm really rich.
0.0	0.341880401027	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.182696976733	My plan is there.
0.0	0.39124881275	But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.
0.0	0.00723520216309	I would prioritize them.
0.0	0.68376326081	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.0215911534475	I agree with them.
0.0	0.156212204495	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.335351235904	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.0060761669834	OK?
0.0	0.0746195896718	So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.
0.0	0.285983487772	We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.
0.0	0.582915537112	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.0358355608945	See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together.
0.0	0.466886566719	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.454535009803	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.140137173762	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.18298244975	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.221762150911	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.230024495914	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.019354506994	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.337718831681	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.562479124211	People died, and only three people have been fired.
0.0	0.189727770891	Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country.
0.0	0.0352106423912	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.197172830818	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.298236561744	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.188393495318	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.811998444938	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.237204208571	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.125461585586	It's called the politics.
0.0	0.0697859869658	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.611027318056	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.5	ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries.
1.0	0.999999620506	Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.
0.0	0.0163661498261	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.192321699955	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.616317872264	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.463996172287	But the facts are simple.
0.0	0.060541967511	You want to know why things don't get done in Washington?
0.0	0.0757303138824	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.248299384653	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
1.0	0.304853979435	They're bringing drugs.
0.0	0.175856708554	I have a problem with that, Martha.
0.0	0.647208414311	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.144364663122	We never dreamt we'd ever see it."
0.0	0.169054572452	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.405573163901	And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
0.0	0.293293386035	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.0692321416497	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
0.0	0.0818720573092	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.151236122927	The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.
0.0	0.120530184349	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.0309881091067	He's very upset.
0.0	0.933116623919	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.19611021003	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.132480554071	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.0795262389428	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.188010907863	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.329227637098	So the fact is that we work for the people.
0.0	0.101401608276	We can do that.
0.0	0.334343205653	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.660275144123	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.0166069229864	You find me...
0.0	0.28899960982	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.343748419445	I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to -- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.
0.0	0.23233496999	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.778308513694	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
1.0	0.51721725791	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.328422332186	Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.
0.0	0.320092668991	Thank you, John.
0.0	0.619200272006	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.175265935406	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.269750298308	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.
0.0	0.014086631974	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.191747803756	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.264681165363	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.221747889698	We now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act, and I don't think we should have to be defending it among Democrats.
1.0	0.999999909556	Very few children.
0.0	0.0895491145475	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.0590840498923	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.404187041191	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.138923151226	I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.235915131194	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.408913801438	And so, you go the extra mile.
0.0	0.246436355987	We actually did it.
0.0	0.831502566186	Bill.
0.0	0.627584795789	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.0520893186709	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.942365033443	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.430143867565	I met recently with some members of the Chaldean Christian communities and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months.

0.0	0.412496702497	Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
0.0	0.58903047933	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.0931760229744	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.0753241801743	May I respond to the critique on the ...
0.0	0.928801387009	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.610560028038	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.0677506789387	So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do.
0.0	0.0453865658651	I love the Saudis.
0.0	0.339050463557	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.110245237067	I think this is a very difficult issue.
0.0	0.0492523273815	...No, sir...
0.0	0.197025669928	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.829000766862	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.254117191226	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.0890255875969	The threat is Islamic terrorism.

0.0	0.128398438399	Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.
0.0	0.0490938225622	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.240302748496	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.198765672071	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.219301082848	I never said that.
0.0	0.427705049188	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.417543481822	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.433093613952	Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, "Rand, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.0576625062537	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.0950690291538	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.675690643996	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.0520480723566	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.
0.0	0.13328563592	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.354682049672	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.186373469113	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.204623638554	Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question.
0.0	0.764306513006	Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor.
0.0	0.157289245138	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.270365039893	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.647092568168	So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.
0.0	0.106569266553	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.204161492445	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
0.0	0.199992896816	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.683603823936	Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.
0.0	0.995348809335	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.16367124916	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
1.0	0.488136068646	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.538359038748	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
1.0	0.508820846284	He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage, and what its effects are.
0.0	0.122643962886	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.303464063394	Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.
0.0	0.354596968762	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.253972335063	But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.
0.0	0.192314220244	Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, "Sorry, fellas.
0.0	0.0567314589362	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.195845948159	We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
0.0	0.0136417520204	Don't believe it.
0.0	0.459766151807	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.
0.0	0.16628777715	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.115891297786	Can I just say this...
0.0	0.0447878280794	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.825197734034	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.284315358319	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
0.0	0.422767473891	We have people that have no incentive to work.
1.0	0.999999930218	The average middle-class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.0990486366846	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.449656663373	But I was born here.
0.0	0.195833897857	That is...
0.0	0.125940396047	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.030762570249	We don't win.
0.0	0.0703176373446	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
0.0	0.0578929379022	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.160309812044	... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region.
0.0	0.152449156258	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.168835158985	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.131193138097	So I've said, if the big banks don't play by the rules, I will break them up.
0.0	0.570509003267	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.17364537853	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.0308641171204	You just can't do it.
0.0	0.121562054037	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.0509708165469	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.119886386243	John, may I -- may I interject here?
0.0	0.2725078277	This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along.
0.0	0.200096003026	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.314370999433	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.0103356367053	That's for sure.
0.0	0.218270152507	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
0.0	0.148012670389	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.0615556639147	We're friends.
0.0	0.163925517661	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.0520748857935	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.121461057383	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.383663342573	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.140122616675	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.0717320531968	That's fine.
0.0	0.686033131126	According to the economists -- who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying -- that $24 trillion -- we're very close -- that's the point of no return.
0.0	0.3306332404	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.185909928919	Kevin, if I could just jump in.
0.0	0.329783535346	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.263845110115	At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida.
0.0	0.0745834181156	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.293196256721	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.360978157157	Martha, may I -- Martha, may I...
0.0	0.165354908035	That's a wonderful business model.
0.0	0.0503346435934	And I think this is an important question.
1.0	0.987344102499	Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.
0.0	0.0641894562146	He undermines it.
0.0	0.141771385682	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.036900614639	We have problems with Russia.
0.0	0.808070746924	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.551774791396	We need, basically, to pledge that we're going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.
0.0	0.0788485146337	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.885397023237	My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.267977189223	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.
0.0	0.595492231583	When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it.
0.0	0.141978343467	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.713362701932	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.244246306318	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.203464555579	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.353731562945	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.162606493461	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.0148241819481	Wait for what?
0.0	0.0923027700286	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.0591030514734	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.362694238396	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
1.0	0.999998753419	And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.0319121848865	I'm ready.
0.0	0.487472663359	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.380354427905	I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones.
0.0	0.313787529159	My heart, like all of us in this room, John, and all the people across our country, my hearts go out to the people of France in this moment of loss.
0.0	0.195833897857	Do it.
0.0	0.0548873238566	He couldn't answer the question.
0.0	0.892285396857	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.424007789559	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.0526388396213	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.121539811302	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.420588444815	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.180998479885	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.0760979391845	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.230680265224	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.179721100198	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.195282157276	...
0.0	0.195282157276	...
0.0	0.528583837293	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.339425958159	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.5195771639	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
0.0	0.298236561744	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.195557880291	2,000?
0.0	0.607468953864	By actually doing more for education.
0.0	0.0342041568668	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.217669067036	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.38146996746	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.126322272798	And before I say it, I have to say this.
0.0	0.137806194061	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.
0.0	0.132235054947	Martha -- I would just repeat that --
0.0	0.00949879783777	I think you're --
0.0	0.150138195564	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.
0.0	0.148254395104	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.
0.0	0.327752914762	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.195207843413	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.651406623651	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
1.0	0.92227488916	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.184876907428	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.262740145881	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.5	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.849156021631	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.387774936655	My patients are beside themselves.
0.0	0.0990159872169	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.82997026523	You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.108378576614	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.181403121538	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.0283720048603	As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe.
0.0	0.330666424642	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.448586931094	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.339346975741	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.110519623789	Yes.
0.0	0.434970766041	So what I had to do then is go back and start working on a bill that wasn't the bill that I wanted.
0.0	0.960437838932	Thousands.
0.0	0.247207447775	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.553124380884	It's interesting that Jeb mentions the book.
0.0	0.195833897857	I do.
0.0	0.165300927534	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.152774879989	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.101662244226	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.177568176687	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.0383235026274	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.313226179066	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...
0.0	0.129149033118	The central question in this race is trust.
0.0	0.0705913053097	And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous.
0.0	0.278148589272	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.283250164184	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.134026982053	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.0306048221212	Neil?
0.0	0.201373528668	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.789947909992	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.0587565401021	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.195557880291	No.
0.0	0.174208910146	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.701968207208	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.636909929957	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.694590301058	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.126105810047	We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.
0.0	0.166698446012	There are many crises that come -- a water crisis in Toledo.
0.0	0.665391802488	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.100180168075	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
1.0	0.945837169337	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.2619679654	We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up.
0.0	0.249320302771	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.117179943676	And we need the right people.
0.0	0.189867571317	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.134165951882	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.363135502738	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.257926276371	There must be some way.
0.0	0.492785154078	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.611321438736	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
0.0	0.631844713063	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.433742454545	People were just being fined to death.
0.0	0.140696015789	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.431689364622	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.131125113178	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.0877772880943	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.267202736697	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.0848343315726	Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.169834963504	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.23103660031	I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace.
0.0	0.253484570659	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.278407597258	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.254018909961	This group needs to be confronted and defeated.
0.0	0.184103135143	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.12883528352	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.449534523537	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.00640868515991	Okay.
0.0	0.0146667923072	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.268352695664	And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.354325503116	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.190316763322	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.283368703035	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.654403354572	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.0355680009458	Thank you.
0.0	0.348408130219	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.246232500301	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
1.0	0.999999777072	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.
0.0	0.204771915271	And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them.
0.0	0.201246595105	I...
0.0	0.0262099359475	That makes no sense at all.
0.0	0.476679767218	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.328510132118	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.5	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.520416620979	Check it out.
0.0	0.604200250765	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.334706546996	I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.
0.0	0.301940404225	I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out.
0.0	0.312114226526	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
1.0	0.883942974548	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.207492208942	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.823192557157	But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it.
0.0	0.646473199854	You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super PAC and they're advertising against me in Iowa as we speak.
0.0	0.126207210403	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.356464094878	Well, thanks for having me.
0.0	0.0137857837696	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.222627416602	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.589813059843	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.620260433227	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.195557880291	And...
0.0	0.109778238353	We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation.
0.0	0.172681258813	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.797124185723	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.263556836122	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
0.0	0.112172506407	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.377998850117	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.114682379562	But states need to do more as well.
0.0	0.119031110745	But I think it's the right road for us to try to travel.
0.0	0.0746770935381	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
0.0	0.321596856817	Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.339528640224	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.236105976289	We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president.
0.0	0.185014641789	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.0984457724361	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.294134170083	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.00755176976514	...Chris...
1.0	0.843977558792	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.0901908434995	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.0884847069236	And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.
0.0	0.225377333883	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
0.0	0.0660701441441	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.282456853518	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.487161355543	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.0960519839166	But people have to be alert.
0.0	0.361058690077	They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe.
0.0	0.175422590915	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.436760020015	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.196386816852	That has not been...
0.0	0.105007611532	Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough.
0.0	0.208251163327	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.530250587603	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.0770800075182	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.40325150421	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.247306664933	And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college.
0.0	0.758663450035	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.460692342744	Yes, I apologize.
0.0	0.250925203451	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.07419587527	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.117546371413	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.102789006865	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.108445648385	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
0.0	0.381433950768	We can in fact create jobs and provide job security.
0.0	0.12826779802	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.132886763899	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.19611021003	Not at all.
0.0	0.167007694277	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.33040122981	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.0555321176495	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.190073042054	Well, I just think you're asking a question with a false choice.
0.0	0.221962370689	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.729043015802	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
0.0	0.396473021691	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.10938215679	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.00719987310279	So I don't think...
0.0	0.260922272235	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.146455625463	They are not our friend, believe me.
0.0	0.455208469218	So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
0.0	0.247186681622	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.805761433572	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
0.0	0.40528211507	For a start, they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes.
0.0	0.0456132148947	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.458032788927	That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.
0.0	0.0177882566477	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.333741697095	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
0.0	0.193616016937	I mean, that's a fact.
0.0	0.454036174907	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
1.0	0.99999872699	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
0.0	0.270990760594	It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state.
0.0	0.485251778763	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.309752965751	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.0610109906663	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.253715417344	If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs.
0.0	0.376620467829	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.040100923923	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.401235731216	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.19055764132	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.0639553871449	Are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not?
0.0	0.40621478576	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.156439117674	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.507983757267	Why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want?
0.0	0.312893474683	We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is.
0.0	0.18942189433	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
0.0	0.129826889206	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.177346265999	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.021264719021	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.770771055807	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.20467097372	And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.
0.0	0.487381115447	Our vets have been abandoned.
0.0	0.478361588915	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.443307176874	If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship.
1.0	0.389109203484	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.103196819225	Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging.
0.0	0.169459660295	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.5	I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place.
0.0	0.180446827343	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.0244295727289	Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.
0.0	0.550680840115	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
1.0	0.945220980518	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.889357833252	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.15601838436	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.0274868692796	Yeah, but let me respond...
0.0	0.116844508027	I said, "I gotta go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.315580587651	So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.
0.0	0.974651850703	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.489449026635	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.0994421577401	How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
0.0	0.45855607486	And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.
0.0	0.71916644007	He has never defended...
0.0	0.614980331049	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.0706227202255	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.555128170661	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
0.0	0.599507026393	I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal.
1.0	0.557594306991	We passed it after 9/11.
0.0	0.266678625982	This nation is the most powerful military in the world.
0.0	0.400037007637	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.00535624263082	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.151989500203	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.111809644466	Go ahead.
0.0	0.452993677369	That's off the table...
0.0	0.197601878077	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.544955488009	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.446980406784	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.282269548343	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.0401859650852	I know the good ones.
0.0	0.995050696322	Could we loan you $4 billion"?
0.0	0.134213883833	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.286715250593	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.655920507967	We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq.
0.0	0.0613173815549	That's who I'm indebted to.
0.0	0.410752702578	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
0.0	0.21687557027	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.238660646916	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.530588267926	Ninety-three hours.
0.0	0.248653305766	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.
0.0	0.316227521574	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.185252500493	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.279175760217	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.435337770853	My mother's dream -- and she died very young, but my mother's dream for her whole life was to be able to get out of that rent-controlled apartment and own a home of her own.

0.0	0.0489063742481	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.388131449206	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.431235349786	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.257192436682	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.618931767264	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.254255113401	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.
0.0	0.342353293348	What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years.
0.0	0.256530998727	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
1.0	0.996740227173	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.831912738562	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.130821538882	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.280292266006	The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.
0.0	0.566540203082	I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons.
0.0	0.695354123296	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.109912782283	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.362633332393	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
1.0	0.979328262965	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.

0.0	0.156626658554	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.00124185063098	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.307379362153	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.222813951423	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
0.0	0.218656269625	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.311251945118	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.272862827605	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.0240458155005	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.656127191872	You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.
0.0	0.947359166985	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.0311106094913	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.457720934142	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.338361361575	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.374755669096	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.469370815387	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.

0.0	0.0943878284748	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.146916074335	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
0.0	0.10955729118	Came out great.
0.0	0.244642404772	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.

0.0	0.235699685759	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.

0.0	0.533655171526	A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.
0.0	0.132948269025	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.375663622958	... first of all...
0.0	0.287317808293	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.447108965478	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.0753147367365	We know about the Brits.
0.0	0.791819840181	We ended up with 56 votes.
0.0	0.160843111191	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.0840233672206	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.164639451657	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.11199402375	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.614590630515	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.555516761557	We expand Medicare to all people.
0.0	0.762551635345	We haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.
0.0	0.43654299585	RADDATZ: OK. Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, right here at Saint Anselm college, Neil Levesque.
0.0	0.271028876075	And now they are beating us economically.

0.0	0.133902923663	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.0732638256668	Our country is in crisis.
0.0	0.080058422067	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
0.0	0.261468758197	That's what I understand is the request from the international...
0.0	0.0422799603553	I'm going to do it for America.
1.0	0.974092515079	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
0.0	0.458964868398	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
1.0	0.829520161512	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.242838839312	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.739695658777	Of course.
0.0	0.111425164332	We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear.
0.0	0.135461365534	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.18287436006	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.0659408051266	Thank you, Marco.
0.0	0.195833897857	You do.
0.0	0.436465080848	Why do -- why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major -- the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?
0.0	0.0686548867212	They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
0.0	0.133780913221	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.
0.0	0.00862535337623	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.109615316166	So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly.
0.0	0.222097717738	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.427500263945	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.100220178486	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.260457475806	If I was president, I'd say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.198609312344	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.176389706745	They are not going to go away on their own.
0.0	0.334392996635	Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
0.0	0.360637407388	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.418101484834	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.0503788025941	I need your help.
0.0	0.108114894948	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.211596568431	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.351641898139	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.663990988127	I hire people, they do a Web site.
0.0	0.0599380031602	They're a great family.
0.0	0.150442240068	But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.
0.0	0.00721250363735	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.288008754717	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
0.0	0.210094836932	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.481093466507	May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care?
0.0	0.197218405667	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.540906684585	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
1.0	0.164982621041	They stole it.
0.0	0.462822530735	Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable?
0.0	0.11647099011	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.665276433573	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
0.0	0.478521257056	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.113235568648	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.267648198159	Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty.
1.0	0.631213007281	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.369984581593	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.203340930764	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.0249121173203	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.319327659749	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.0848612873112	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.270989697082	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
1.0	0.996546486485	Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world.
0.0	0.361600175038	This ties into campaign finance reform.
0.0	0.855848382737	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.0940839275434	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.178803071587	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.0904678705246	I want security for this country.
1.0	0.999993939199	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.156092385683	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.12761614581	Well, they're glitches because...
0.0	0.00389052784789	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.0716663121366	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.415893593107	John.
0.0	0.618433899584	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.693885003565	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.380974879648	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.0411764129782	... What was your question...
0.0	0.290718614851	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.134357771146	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.0766928309433	They elected moderate leaders.
0.0	0.0161575963029	But it will be...
0.0	0.238493213206	Planned Parenthood will be defunded.
0.0	0.222039289168	Nobody can do that like me.
0.0	0.435304694182	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.548936801246	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...
0.0	0.113507731954	But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
0.0	0.839716210084	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.520197032947	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.106600185551	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.401809488794	And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.
0.0	0.232416734322	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.28075895828	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.151582935125	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.35012403778	The answer is simple.
1.0	0.99999999489	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
1.0	0.47789248995	I did introduce legislation to reign in compensation.
0.0	0.264855877105	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.191403403746	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.300914962401	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.125630317599	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.
0.0	0.327558060363	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
0.0	0.226446990942	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.0984463633299	On welfare.
0.0	0.0313189561404	I like it.
0.0	0.317656071024	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.192190526381	I was there in '89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.
0.0	0.143543085159	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.53011630105	I think that is the number one requirement.

0.0	0.244839562631	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.

0.0	0.567691788485	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.225151863748	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.222592594889	It cannot solely be America's fight.
0.0	0.407870266903	And I'll tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign.
0.0	0.281628092445	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.518250055205	Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force.
0.0	0.273677864678	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.
0.0	0.4674850788	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.961692743259	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.892843285124	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.231451341648	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.779298959277	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.37536022204	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.0940616042379	I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination.
0.0	0.220429774464	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.435880003241	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.516038157686	Now that Russia has joined us in the Security Council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago, now I think we can have those conversations.
0.0	0.40983710064	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
1.0	0.999992701839	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.37721912121	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.0746561071297	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.

0.0	0.0827840342657	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.70518435865	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.727112967337	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.262423874718	Yes, and it was the same one that President Obama made.
0.0	0.12484316458	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?
0.0	0.34682894451	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.411608602389	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.10031488196	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.073350126243	Believe me, folks.
0.0	0.6850560276	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.34799407192	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.0753900435163	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
1.0	0.972799676808	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.101247775446	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.110519623789	Yes.
0.0	0.00124185063098	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.0602501374905	And I've been there.
0.0	0.196663718369	That's what it is.
0.0	0.0750206628992	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.227124043538	We need to end minimal sentencing.
0.0	0.354565194184	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.417003664666	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
1.0	0.99305621131	A $5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.154540224944	We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?
0.0	0.100426983508	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.100936556113	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.0641916812293	That's the future of banking in America.
0.0	0.604448478419	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.102743246588	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
0.0	0.244834273908	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.241484871087	If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.
0.0	0.12150956419	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.792595883851	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.218689875734	No interest," because I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.5	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.711297219441	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.10488988543	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.508915152147	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.198223602782	From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made.
0.0	0.277521693373	When was the last time you heard China is killing us?
0.0	0.267465716289	That never works.
0.0	0.408934104324	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.116275993247	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.198366396095	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.486073313943	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.090963539493	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.0668298508409	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.0887440991696	But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.304427344175	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.255083903105	Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength.
0.0	0.362780884241	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.
0.0	0.523263311706	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.237737671961	That means everything.
0.0	0.0524243229356	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.295792341547	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.704373660015	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.459591572587	So I would say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.11100003493	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.297261935573	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.136549578803	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.167870916222	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.115536710584	They will be our early warning signal.
0.0	0.337962061476	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
0.0	0.177271642349	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.0794477862194	I want a job."
1.0	0.999999961947	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.398825368243	In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, "Donald, you don't have enough borrowings.
0.0	0.11187727761	They beat us all the time.
0.0	0.26788093666	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.411306149875	ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.
0.0	0.320128218715	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.363961647178	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.0701865805503	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.409667688435	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.35457551719	White people?
0.0	0.207151116779	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.557902958943	We've enacted it in our state.
0.0	0.839831701259	In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.
0.0	0.0793519163232	You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.
0.0	0.192115321939	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.168167632383	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.087127753455	And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth.
0.0	0.438435384046	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.199968670313	And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...
0.0	0.0808195083129	You have a problem with ISIS.
0.0	0.42481032931	My oldest daughter's a teacher.
0.0	0.0960530986946	It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible.
0.0	0.683375740274	You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon.
0.0	0.617461329357	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.
0.0	0.195608733226	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.563181565616	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.43220215683	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.163458674354	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.455562698095	And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.

0.0	0.111937043167	Becky --
0.0	0.358699746358	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.437126999703	Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes.
0.0	0.122628145166	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.126798749951	John, I'll tell you something.

1.0	0.950813846642	And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions.
0.0	0.622467146047	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.110519623789	Yes.

0.0	0.0760277388488	I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs.

0.0	0.344097063874	I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.
0.0	0.19602630634	And I was clear about that at the time.

0.0	0.0272310916024	But here's what's going to happen:
1.0	0.845477967079	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
0.0	0.182373264945	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.37373229645	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.264152455716	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
