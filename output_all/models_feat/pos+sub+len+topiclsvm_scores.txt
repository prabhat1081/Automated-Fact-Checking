0.0	0.442544750411	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.540544835925	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.

0.0	0.33806960619	You have to lead.
0.0	0.634265221957	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.566831070088	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.364108786013	That's what he is.
0.0	0.478637705252	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...

0.0	0.508501259098	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.578266832749	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
1.0	0.51154226979	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.431162997633	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.642287047727	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.643562506435	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.450469533262	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.467622142333	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.

0.0	0.563912929376	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.395621731689	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.0	Yeah.
0.0	0.573624868173	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.475898382923	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.462766731565	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.3540767863	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.265245339123	Credibility counts.

0.0	0.316052604502	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.383238630547	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.61686508869	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.609913722112	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.531947767906	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.637862351633	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.434134092315	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.56219636001	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.542257782976	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.603369220162	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.374089908994	We just can't do it any longer.

0.0	0.51532359212	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.493502801384	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.521218486027	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.524272502426	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.448075741452	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.

0.0	0.50570498073	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.525653420719	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.450807564431	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.510116849483	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.381032673714	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.622716369516	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.

0.0	0.498545130479	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.588044312582	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.504295840728	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.652933104547	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
1.0	0.565123750042	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.539074677933	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	1.0	You're right.

0.0	0.496402056297	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.41654286047	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.528295337871	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.527293309272	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.

0.0	0.327219759361	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.487616055036	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.529378980655	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.

0.0	0.576010459491	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.515082762873	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.

0.0	0.484997961157	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.513337271608	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.50887596008	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.562608116132	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.532063176606	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.544760406469	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.550825237701	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.

0.0	0.365975606009	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.509107006499	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.308912443269	We need Jordan.

0.0	0.29943500777	You just want to...
0.0	0.340505051596	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.456566475074	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.413401962177	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.

0.0	0.507671078589	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.384710642535	Judy, one area very briefly...

0.0	0.249295549622	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.341173069382	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.550848852659	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.347750855114	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.46531612088	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.528678631286	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.606693495054	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.

0.0	0.484983790109	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.481887979844	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.341083077422	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.620430899079	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.376855251775	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.329621081436	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.461261978785	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.329087840159	In addition to that...

0.0	0.424358356673	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.524821472708	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.459184203097	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.389661142588	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.56589754339	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.564495130328	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.584433491694	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.4899742724	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.38244915747	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.

0.0	0.521011458882	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.608088545896	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.478526508665	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.320629358049	I think you're --
0.0	0.427855949243	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.454126071425	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.499558219539	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.363880419161	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.295178902621	You know why?
0.0	0.4557761212	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.498610989304	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.523572849965	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
1.0	0.456502829269	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.458372972808	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.469919630921	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.555142944709	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.372138227088	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.516803581602	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.552638095754	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.444776915557	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.604225700442	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.598124122984	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.437624408634	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.459087944499	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.591179336358	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.590796794906	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.51072678149	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.563734624497	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.512753293724	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.

0.0	0.59958928392	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.545375773612	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.659411846313	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.50885776165	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.529258942821	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.560714495514	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.511180041745	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.54803908988	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.273295150159	He's wrong.
0.0	0.53784477516	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.

0.0	0.510066379723	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.379250172694	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.602585974434	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.470666301341	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.562521635068	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.417716557487	We have to provide financial support to them.

0.0	0.462193145069	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.333049214174	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.510290221905	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.

1.0	0.550647073272	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.289078887836	Think about it.
0.0	0.651915139612	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.334917496582	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.272045588923	On welfare.
0.0	0.438489982182	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.370854076926	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.460116726004	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.273379563893	We do.
0.0	0.420377260717	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.542673943763	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.569606130764	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.495982565673	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.524118400773	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.348809746093	QUICK: Governor, thank you.

0.0	0.566839838095	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.430818597945	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.561322862885	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.502719670509	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.545074156028	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.566052426344	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.

0.0	0.369064546622	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.566403823293	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.

0.0	0.615330609054	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.522874570613	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.495287401021	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.452269270278	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.371488641061	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.

0.0	0.456795452183	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.364616301464	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.534840393495	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.573386126776	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
1.0	0.573845959975	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.552742951237	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.570814476794	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.326854174823	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.644638086227	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.422841032435	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.365312246207	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.532951832595	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.376867579688	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.603497559822	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.377651822585	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.57045948693	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.476324398016	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.597365319488	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.49470086467	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.549223035551	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.572403151237	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.31790078148	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.500763367915	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.56266287315	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.331831353612	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.556556991841	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.439333510635	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.583843611793	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.580416329647	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.490814406097	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.539849098739	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.388975450823	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.309224765686	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.405847329348	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.450435725948	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.359344668127	We can't do it.
0.0	0.482179351752	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.549092570432	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.488026049529	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.479035515505	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.634441800895	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.

0.0	0.303981027443	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.562313026236	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.598113555053	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.393414167447	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.380119972052	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.325237699521	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.506539579232	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.267790857683	About Medicare?
0.0	0.511619776097	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.528931903414	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.566074820434	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.494567046283	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.483989196032	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.400100523645	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.601529487924	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.524285091059	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.467987371897	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.603160101773	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.550089771452	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
1.0	0.586634324965	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.534096441008	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.448782153244	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.390986023489	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.551843019639	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.494614452445	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.531170573616	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.589205239704	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.489270451804	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.45098157248	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.634457722712	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.429511558886	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.405037582295	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.41380818148	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.480379645149	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.616940590311	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.396433260782	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.594919857149	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.309503264616	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.571550242426	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.621618497764	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.273379563893	You do.
0.0	0.461236583545	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.620681836983	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.3158382526	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.643667825029	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.581097888838	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.331527966113	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.462724277679	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.588828635638	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.524000468097	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.463143051082	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.655917794611	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.287773604065	No their not.
0.0	0.381598165111	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.295886806278	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.504151958152	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.514908608314	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
1.0	0.602310678967	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.47581725455	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.47681744357	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.287502058508	Wait for what?
0.0	0.264025417569	Came out great.
0.0	0.39860747623	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.513321305863	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.536240227585	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.424122830162	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.47798342078	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.0	Yeah.
0.0	0.630457160904	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.319946672683	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.350335645478	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.353604773226	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.46918320306	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.513370877473	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.56616827638	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.624806573252	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.495386226339	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.413574642518	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.409633619156	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.336314560282	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.40940098231	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.388690054542	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.444349331803	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.568172966869	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.579404407269	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.566077373808	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.499258606869	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.579117515146	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.504726204643	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.415927413091	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.406386440794	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.560384168361	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.591743222545	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.624664731389	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.608292045095	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.583942885378	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.397281634811	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.410370013913	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.346314399912	You know why three?
1.0	0.654095680799	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.678201288426	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.398786134529	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.384325101305	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.61259990208	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.535522551986	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.632088042246	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.302457948184	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.387133643185	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.551901554484	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.270971463021	It feels different.
0.0	0.276165095332	Two points.
0.0	0.498324647026	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.43599088408	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.551266125897	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.65577386478	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.457476050725	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.567329605186	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.478393176018	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.50047054056	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.483704660281	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.462700052997	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.545329827304	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.540121084446	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.426932646232	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.482324386024	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.685345545671	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
1.0	0.452752576485	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.302933809277	We need sound money.
0.0	0.519030058835	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.46377959172	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.583139689654	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.447648101889	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.416688686307	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.547180960491	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.445881268316	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.545957611441	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.304242416338	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.555349718488	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.396318207844	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.498457606306	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.347966746657	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.603177894946	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.5942235599	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.579263346375	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.621375719743	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.422080886008	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.58055975915	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.421233007211	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.57033419043	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.388586589171	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.551100467628	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.456683029449	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.550768276033	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.329602874243	You really can't.
0.0	0.559303044898	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.399092282323	Let me tell you how that question...
1.0	0.549631887997	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.584092178897	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.421480712623	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.510658577695	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.295178902621	You know why?
1.0	0.526637228692	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.474924144182	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.453360376081	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.515975533352	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.430355901489	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.503485041031	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
1.0	0.658343913745	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.681041089029	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.591913905379	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.632917161314	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.428061386507	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.444757945285	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.538030890087	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.5073048019	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.492647571597	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.347910052556	No, it's true.
0.0	0.336071772333	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.569743695431	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.5728306591	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.537436488629	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.459826067785	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.439992243086	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.523563729825	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.483772222813	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
1.0	0.577628434472	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.651602602206	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.566363744215	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.63931446282	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.622538368304	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.606138978549	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.672655972875	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.390990183695	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.0	Okay.
0.0	0.445658465456	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.574212469249	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.443734359873	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.519993817394	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.563205397523	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.597251489143	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.515644907015	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.516383956027	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.555117599145	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.504847266028	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.382997238412	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.507858255915	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.526664462795	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.584148363028	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.581448222862	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.532027227817	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.596831016741	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.543270242581	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.561780080556	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.403461281223	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.320114600171	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.604061656175	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.335337196809	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.644140593938	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.443211185817	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.297280102373	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.627440673986	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.539766419529	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.597059126687	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.513249671422	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.59506336602	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.306169388276	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.577287714171	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.376742504673	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.470106747959	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.52578890175	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
1.0	0.360790725718	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.440573129779	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.420005753025	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
1.0	0.637661931579	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.572735016176	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.478686873893	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.422773384865	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
1.0	0.52530449537	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.322222062276	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.587177945517	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.372582057176	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.665937210535	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.587134906686	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.568608601829	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.319182147097	I don't care.
0.0	0.580190470473	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.383856201174	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.390300139595	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.522838599709	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.483537598416	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.339880736082	We don't win.
0.0	0.548825773509	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.574651441459	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.415670231857	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.406610965954	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.675384701103	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.297444191727	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.256121641203	But look...
0.0	0.506905447583	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.349469715065	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.412275472612	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.359232350775	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.528606951802	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.644286976015	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.47825372092	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.532981099601	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.6129132101	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.506674653172	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.547422494066	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.527322822905	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.485828471731	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.548430199332	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.307331623883	I love China.
0.0	0.457636570586	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.327394259074	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.344108519731	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.475119293475	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.52720808381	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.436355466582	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.411949726331	Of course you are right.
1.0	0.466289563192	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.627691967431	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.369230568112	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.548074658186	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.51419303949	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.291135711193	That's not right.
0.0	0.416425348955	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.578270591576	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.537096940624	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.535507287323	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.502916089755	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.651251673495	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.581264403335	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.653183734784	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.528931903414	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.27492562634	I win.
0.0	0.461386934494	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.501164070981	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.484547208007	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.430359452563	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.474133519809	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
1.0	0.577556498328	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.435374307917	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.610569281408	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.589540134511	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.546153762227	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.607205442448	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.421314152764	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.574926918302	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.556535007228	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.513283191834	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.49513524539	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.427077101726	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.518780037569	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.368689897213	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
1.0	0.543167220572	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.654088556355	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.496310320802	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.538727264765	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.555399107052	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
1.0	0.505070960775	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.61585137318	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.459059138234	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.514968125724	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.45938485353	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.590248261857	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.589762198461	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.49602525404	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.431317990993	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.362992256789	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.369040906506	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.475249789747	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.614997175033	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.298076700565	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.451536785814	Why didn't they call the police?
1.0	0.416179614023	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.433748312509	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.548881264173	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.576057447308	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.545820139222	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.262354750559	And why?
0.0	0.399134227964	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.38963443593	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.496382069144	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.557551674214	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.355168227722	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.516565048621	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
1.0	0.578304524689	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.324774689876	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.565463537015	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.510673385576	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.421381940059	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.486080505539	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.463662678953	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.495804999204	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.560933351713	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.477535072664	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.491391130458	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.290234484227	I didn't.
0.0	0.594007679661	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.436203976288	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.526490328017	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.387476471607	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.56629117361	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.235315533716	Maria...
0.0	0.477130798956	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.63553920533	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.59228690773	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.560118540652	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.504098942874	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.339823773433	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.359448630797	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.521114774406	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.609752627982	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.493632573834	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.601949820411	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.341870833291	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.411345266085	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.475441818112	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.389025692038	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.523342734759	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.455369832466	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.275349667643	Can we stop?
0.0	0.52942121142	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.39389177944	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.60134251929	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.472148880601	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.451803724574	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.435367007229	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.60489584363	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.552608490088	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.430227328267	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.421600539782	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.407828773492	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.407095929687	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.661056435803	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.567189948101	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.464192882083	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.559092093898	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.296457654123	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.591616879757	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.509928054739	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
1.0	0.534642706102	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.505713574943	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.618897515258	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.56674699159	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.586537767307	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.521360520597	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.585606508747	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.454666107921	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.406870476575	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.580580428372	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.589839015177	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
1.0	0.526915402653	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.54822709233	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.358038489856	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.462309779824	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.561997413712	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.406946415446	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.487608171312	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.515129670473	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.349210009958	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.566923754768	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.574894688071	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.305505106295	We're friends.
0.0	0.617554144974	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.43230605505	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.413873713483	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.505433018816	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.383845665593	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.615844388377	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.410844842711	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.60622819591	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.456367879429	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.344482362616	We don't need that.
0.0	0.557698560518	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.603218109651	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.486801928207	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.483654834298	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.461114939163	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.555385640393	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.466706018357	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.495047279354	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.349811672907	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.444324909723	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.542441397214	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
1.0	0.572576536301	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.50416475307	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.585575786262	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.565850747681	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.543486767506	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.485064122303	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.456687821776	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.524977224466	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.480690818355	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.581209142288	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.537069059528	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.674374072154	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.615987935679	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.361753374946	You count on it.
0.0	0.459940306422	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.435103829773	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.358635844189	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.474919606216	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.358930999053	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.548715424705	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
1.0	0.549846127984	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.524512662275	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.507230303119	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.455362637001	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.529059651317	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.447497761038	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.446202015798	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.554850481719	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.552275684423	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.489986956109	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.658067859817	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.412513407481	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.482649897184	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.546213554718	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.474106551799	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.603547954857	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.548536025962	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.548947106235	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.398544143839	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.545132161604	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.568662558794	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.511209678252	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.623613347666	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.304031994689	That's my view.
0.0	0.425996028267	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.502437517906	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.343261263484	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.451590824567	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.491062831308	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.429072172259	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.590648463413	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.485795721158	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.462057628771	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.447912146039	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.527205309316	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.577609562393	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.302421444678	In all due respect...
0.0	0.457119389022	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.434482187209	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.603989382454	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.496683440061	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.455714539015	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.34885302055	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.512294996341	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.340358228596	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.416245666183	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.597658044345	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.453488362888	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.545734262013	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.579012490998	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.646160127485	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.374269316335	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.408397644164	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.650028969606	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.550860032073	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.506561802799	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.545058465258	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.558518917831	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.62002296127	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.408119941629	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.0	Ever.
0.0	0.449761503786	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.452405836236	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.386989193731	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.569177881616	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.512439917178	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.485017654628	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.585877029135	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.345869068453	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.495412938069	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.598092193722	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.495867630157	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.506883268331	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.547916929715	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.394485905831	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.55533039798	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.519229826427	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.429186006873	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.

0.0	0.555206407998	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.253010397175	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.490445568013	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.330707969044	You can have him.
0.0	0.589390304779	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.395580665964	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.420542703544	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.572202691168	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.553803791199	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.337344059499	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.539457335301	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.459456324518	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.362971861304	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.370833716309	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.524806427614	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.431385902017	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.606044719373	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.519468301549	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.577000070474	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.546036773867	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.388122992181	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.346828436524	We actually did it.
0.0	0.649012908791	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.502897907482	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.450685330358	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.546502613427	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.235315533716	Becky --
0.0	0.495165655489	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.338278385449	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.62639547407	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.468463806283	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.509282273813	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.408879165958	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.538268024581	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.587377656611	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.499391854622	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.345799983475	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.29591733852	I'm ready.
0.0	0.591225808057	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.42220138361	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.319146301159	The answer is no.
0.0	0.553645748205	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.465736655104	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.367483207989	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.562232979628	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.426532703215	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.5436862975	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.3754936213	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.591268043753	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.475208819912	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.428711699746	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.56649241693	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
1.0	0.49651576181	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.325003658689	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.469109573811	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.453769204073	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.544152669579	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.250155559104	Not bad.
0.0	0.663637643833	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.432475983044	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.314979482903	I like that.
0.0	0.686264442337	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.405132051247	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.581392471014	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.556061646276	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.4011913673	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.58371722451	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.634995337222	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.465899019134	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.563378673594	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.415475732375	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.290234484227	She was right.
0.0	0.505323028339	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.549522156241	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.39798142574	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.535428826452	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.334013791165	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.49336184172	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.490226988172	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.499665611153	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.555856391232	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.551629511941	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.290824257484	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.552864385292	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.625473318222	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.506912776979	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.317492899233	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.503112295242	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.536301852778	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.364200722987	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.526351230674	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.518350631884	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.367362494535	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.41807522102	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.405109134294	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.59787019423	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.609241800122	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.410588750617	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.297506074938	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.436002882829	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.426913330842	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.506031376222	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
1.0	0.520267993847	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.559925324102	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.57561012638	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.388442983823	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.276791403958	It never happens.
0.0	0.573020243735	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.450928996846	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.489711735846	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.462079686646	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.275370007592	He does great.
0.0	0.654172678573	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.390646770059	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.411144858506	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.519587319003	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.551194588529	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.578089637675	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.536343431245	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
1.0	0.387899183856	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.341508676041	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.327065695081	I was the architect.
0.0	0.535665730962	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.540352705402	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.358549800706	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.447625535347	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.438764392551	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.548239556248	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.566020550317	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.526723601433	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.55624788177	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.565915754238	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.602525885892	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.307922390521	My point is this.
0.0	0.3810614898	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.662436366853	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.260671851339	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.325133006743	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.489445608391	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.340479918896	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.422200242403	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.379435679826	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.302696954245	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.295885015238	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.601151542159	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.414712464918	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
1.0	0.562847336463	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.419746799935	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.339344653868	We have no borders.
0.0	0.270410585476	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.542205030874	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.549254752167	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.382235273464	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.583085060488	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.478671239792	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.495543956333	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.593393922107	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.414614728332	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.556992243478	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.279125833498	We were wrong.
0.0	0.439716308332	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.572311166205	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.543416836531	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.525143883079	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.583942636704	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.608592704526	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.473089424971	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.409987507644	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.514651086262	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.365557300468	...10% flat rate...
1.0	0.606525567081	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
1.0	0.485043941108	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.367099189798	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.610011031394	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.472573725882	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.630953565359	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.39907192819	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.258368120972	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.549838658684	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.399622581302	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.467613722812	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.515679103617	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.422668119685	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.57639421514	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.370273666192	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.61551992139	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.553053777548	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.522185535703	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.414514905366	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.44854959167	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.250137235431	And so do I.
0.0	0.513920416879	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.45057117368	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.479575815111	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.528307018293	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	1.0	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.620996847369	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.371640313822	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.552697993615	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.556265642456	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.391807278655	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.287902277575	How about this?
0.0	0.605699008798	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.494646060503	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.266352974452	He's wrong.
0.0	0.333777726816	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.569810955784	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.468887445344	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.418866190065	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.44028463214	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.403987348572	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.421683820138	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.435500951396	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.575787828638	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.588743646464	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.333669524935	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.467611917699	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.530423389292	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.542433939642	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.276791403958	It goes away.
0.0	0.612439963731	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.513064099484	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.504793115906	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.54364946412	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.288730728416	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.556556704662	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.495795835685	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.606138208443	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.534005344761	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.533942503733	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.504120010059	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.575041720863	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.409606051865	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.632142611229	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.439033542388	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.518789042292	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.621618712123	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.467617536469	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.58547310632	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.508957197611	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.450505604033	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.62754769216	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.43441365677	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.442653141393	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.548386801179	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.56061427803	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.385887737597	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.456777244888	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.631819437209	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.549859694862	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.454062516044	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
1.0	0.545941511692	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.49754703019	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.382057162454	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.276204836885	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.350411298852	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.503946684283	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.567916995955	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.544750217941	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.520021582528	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.329037511176	to save a company.
0.0	0.639984693757	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.634458074651	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.509482955896	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.46556190098	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.569081033638	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.397536399456	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.367748669409	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.349467732538	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.280047596369	No, no.
0.0	0.582754571782	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.351049552304	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.572535111258	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.606359292316	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.622523554372	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.420853216883	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.673931191049	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.595922192295	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.601953258713	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.571369853033	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.511706334519	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.356304879304	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.541598696022	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.453173098212	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.348064591582	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.573306017816	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.465254358533	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.232567364564	And...
0.0	0.625343729817	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.565718707193	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.48916058827	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.376182978968	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.412717508948	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.335128955819	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.523548920845	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.545235932846	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.359059150966	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.623904564643	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.488147253338	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.587744921744	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.338220089532	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.492777160552	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.391678770144	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.394208748987	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.306084737714	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.450945091912	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.38672907492	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.455762579563	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.667500035229	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.389359545153	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.448477055699	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.560705755005	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.545093251095	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.281212343605	That's fine.
0.0	0.323947468108	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.58538666299	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.433870460189	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.484055710549	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.555511637668	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.332005701671	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.603901627959	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.59046285958	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.61464111544	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.597908910898	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.513239554669	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.46509286437	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
1.0	0.65312665983	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.544264563833	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.29816755212	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.0	Creativity.
0.0	0.361948737038	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.496144184197	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.494334797845	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.557369369916	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.594818848001	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.323754868406	I love this country.
0.0	0.302231452829	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.349911673967	I think he is right.
0.0	0.535607396139	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.61068017789	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.542442979507	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.596567200751	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.60247099837	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.468695013958	It's called the value added tax.
1.0	0.544753536935	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.305104259955	He undermines it.
0.0	0.518267991158	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.332761312801	But you know what?
0.0	0.0	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.464686590935	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.528731801033	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.573522527916	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.0	OK.
0.0	0.344482362616	They don't like that.
0.0	0.590895670733	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.569749708791	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.593607236249	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.64091376327	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
1.0	0.513758846987	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.47375045132	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.462198597208	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.519086442257	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.511411400422	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.452063343123	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.411115263761	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.343909471227	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.571817480283	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.677969968649	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.470640467388	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.541664191609	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.564311627066	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.473947927763	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.510488299726	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.340966900118	I agree with them.
0.0	0.550479620426	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.509243235083	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.56366810466	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.427844630122	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.339432114146	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.378832700412	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.539717560224	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
1.0	0.617282126118	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.394979749055	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.563454184937	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
1.0	0.678818817864	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.595203792775	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.278265514242	We need security.
0.0	0.37677062576	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.270757792584	They know.
0.0	0.506575482775	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.503700616111	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.463771953256	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.559350787111	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.480261242272	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.547758741211	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.597280802828	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.341756895412	They're a scam.
0.0	0.475679572932	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.506384762356	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
1.0	0.599672167108	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.465224210041	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.644185646596	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.457736572484	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.531483064462	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.455860841211	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.502375355776	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.49348890791	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.424825288797	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.642530907858	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.373611991613	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.498171047827	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.625764325642	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.539015330165	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.346808477243	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.279196484381	Think about that.
0.0	0.572054055353	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.380239614886	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.634412031113	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.566502515972	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.355617984774	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.423225598178	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.463919660456	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.440490857739	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.543545686954	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.583140901095	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.491979774852	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.603477413418	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.0	(inaudible).
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.380615964919	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.525498065853	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.599964874124	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.539446215308	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.501164070981	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.525214461677	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.657401451559	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.581293136509	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.50564524054	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.433229592805	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.59798622971	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.360584021684	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.619547856243	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.466405697663	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.432401181774	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.51419303949	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.441857903477	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.412621663205	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.483439940935	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.643124810414	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.567427480087	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.442320764632	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.329702629434	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.475861425944	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.460765109373	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.285404505406	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.453688686865	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.519612037823	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.404658305671	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.348923237456	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.438104924842	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.561517304626	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.518355118279	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.657975630175	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.0	Right.
1.0	0.441005634619	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.543318848694	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.631132996481	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.480587823616	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.0	That's right.
0.0	0.495953678676	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.391483243154	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.54441242857	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.362453823237	I never said that.
0.0	0.575484602663	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.516704663517	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.650452017609	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.367683873493	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.540753166087	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
1.0	0.497836459276	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.640704778436	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.484606491134	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.56639034667	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.616298933509	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.573345084288	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.617163909486	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.359533272119	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.534421923759	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.410476592733	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.5300553241	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.392628466145	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.370979390424	The Emanuel AME church killings.
1.0	0.603903015014	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.557518770966	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.357908406231	We have a tremendous problem.
1.0	0.544843656417	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.455761522906	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.382666586024	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.546919664403	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.598560252936	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.474393702043	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.418822767445	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.292135979056	Why is that?
0.0	0.435021568505	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.61033500825	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.556123737241	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.616620709109	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.373767077859	That is our government today.
0.0	0.277724932035	...Thank you.
0.0	0.622231303248	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.479877027997	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
1.0	0.521918864348	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
1.0	0.454567920275	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.343000742612	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.448282470826	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.533806102294	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.694104803279	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.58039923548	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.53657287785	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.532542802613	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.558528791392	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.516335102983	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.469011837246	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.348874970438	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.346488968298	You bet they do.
0.0	0.580224429647	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.481405208119	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.441935063601	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.449811429174	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.383838284079	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.300440975744	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.592884888192	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.433183868204	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.486980564814	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.58117350959	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.333364275788	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.434994806638	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.513656127368	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
1.0	0.599049539361	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.42261287272	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.523235681465	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.556235454318	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.394186859957	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.618139626559	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.602231888438	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.576314997845	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.479614849253	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.517838289056	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.572198925369	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.56104946599	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.352460599877	...before I go.
0.0	0.617350171111	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.537430095154	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.530102641244	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.439471123294	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.474965317045	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.431172702281	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.609530182703	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.592520933078	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.560369049629	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.64578081055	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.394830287268	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.338005044258	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.537781452321	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.582028796457	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.3860335958	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.619610167336	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.390936637676	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.463745833341	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.266294171025	I can.
0.0	0.593488855475	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.556898956832	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.363375698262	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.558799784801	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.504513494908	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.657240293814	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.499242759884	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.563101751633	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
1.0	0.312269506225	They stole it.
0.0	0.37647311268	We have not provided them.
1.0	0.6178193599	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.372891855041	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.449814693484	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.605987009143	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.455260150961	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.496678014966	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.461741226049	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.321106558292	That's my bill.
0.0	0.375833393394	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.497319487982	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.420105562614	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.564089302645	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.494133801796	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.265083165359	And guess what?
0.0	0.448284638061	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.450178640232	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.492333169619	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.523861342395	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.359344668127	I can't do it.
0.0	0.635940621741	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.525052812733	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.51230984416	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.597051157154	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.546285140054	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.310644049442	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.515233078292	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.544798506689	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.409721983412	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.5635629779	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.632559194151	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.488340012504	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.587753977456	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.481756857232	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.380364134075	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.405250234835	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.516241306768	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.581245513051	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.374566872516	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.542965752153	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.649768340992	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.548820044172	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
1.0	0.6318572369	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.54134041789	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.587247049323	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.518512554683	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.344482362616	I don't like that.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.265264242823	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.479554722451	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.562809466125	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.594517247946	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.537142209624	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.579817907291	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.539828063948	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.436632743021	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.458993442666	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.306508340056	I got that.
0.0	0.477515433208	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.539635110078	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.551686318898	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.611420755556	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.505840541171	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.575546629001	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.311574224109	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.466455830501	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.522935529691	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.647895897122	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.495915558626	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.590568661832	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.652617391891	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.361035306514	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.603438690721	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
1.0	0.557036910024	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.417861541846	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.47567465649	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.524152646891	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.516532923564	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.581365678635	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.4257240916	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.352088368786	You don't have to.
0.0	0.231420036339	So...
0.0	0.465813277308	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.472139167458	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.547213740915	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.630215839958	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.281980591691	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.502477312135	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.561626169854	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.3922812782	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.589029456141	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.468867167016	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.521002531543	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.559894793759	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.565806591923	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.512387192594	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.647334620064	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.288727196017	No, John.
0.0	0.625877360698	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.619609923073	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.358275897781	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.565099586578	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.636113923044	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.573004819632	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.468138182679	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.273379563893	I have.
0.0	0.529686487193	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.415539265546	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.481316553205	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.512720558021	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.569716374515	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.425869701688	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.477583879432	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.568097847503	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.658300531192	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.342344962071	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.510917848715	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.439283709749	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.534923870821	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.488087112804	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.344666735225	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.528317767175	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.340964195702	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.529680383902	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.432942964616	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.496897199768	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.562038661266	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.573937353672	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.470169609628	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.544363079506	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
1.0	0.390129046208	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.289078887836	Think about it.
0.0	0.536804785216	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.570127515453	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.379069382944	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.343987014109	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.576467574349	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.536169712501	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.358325965517	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.503213772598	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.411425769114	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.270634499493	I have...
0.0	0.509017406627	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.514180043445	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.522523555326	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.291135711193	That's not right.
0.0	0.658458811522	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.44115170812	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.28417494597	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.532880556144	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.512406747725	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
1.0	0.573711708388	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.536296024777	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.482402843493	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.513097090845	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.633982040652	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.474083650427	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.561775106997	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.56324373307	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.455889921216	And I make a lot more than the average American.
1.0	0.459344149406	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.482969256365	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
1.0	0.406729249965	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.498333211087	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.638075387005	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.332574256086	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.399146819364	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.625862372644	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.55365805212	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.491510964097	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.575572343964	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.612408418496	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.583687644936	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.511710875721	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.311135606077	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.385311258619	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.586803707948	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.509379317133	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.550760805012	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.464230791077	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.533569818439	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.431715867007	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.364912132623	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.535127064832	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.638173506	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.348816137177	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.473494398516	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.449744605487	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.562084276563	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.465143446207	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.321168755424	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.446810508042	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.540160226061	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.512316788862	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.404805061094	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.688561388358	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.558062904427	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.489109022408	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.330068440217	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.419105929926	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.408757747515	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.403326146591	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.394013712827	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.217546646147	See?
0.0	0.466278775499	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.618754864779	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.313207751152	You know that.
0.0	0.383125274298	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.470651838374	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.443297392117	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.624533233206	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.533370242921	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.419834484786	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.451402191989	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.467000178558	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.437016481091	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.454803235863	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.345667536929	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.540170655117	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.584279486742	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.526740647045	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.552902227496	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.397281592183	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.618340527875	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.535184891626	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.39464167071	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.578279878219	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.546904723772	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.331026975086	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.613195860509	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.378719645507	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.593583419945	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.545247554162	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.559277291754	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.627138603768	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.558400714933	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.611474732319	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.457837493199	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.533112840145	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.458679772227	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.595282719865	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.483537592055	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.564879398668	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.467410831806	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.552738386264	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.423309814276	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.574045555744	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.553525520126	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.533050350391	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.478211122433	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.489193339289	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.567726873708	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.416472673446	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.477045023268	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.356039944491	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.534911749452	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.629427528139	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.35390717756	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.594692295431	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.382573041481	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.560507326224	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.41910240094	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.384257549591	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.466502745611	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.614257862711	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.527467897394	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.609842638871	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.522678869365	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.502248616013	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.568164510499	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.55551788342	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.316886358844	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.636829134809	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.286166067282	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.546862363024	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.602663528764	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
1.0	0.362819651021	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.462297255094	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.468774857375	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.525066221511	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.556968350282	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.498387328635	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.441855789784	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.404599021151	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.534543488489	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.507491120388	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.35711256185	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.48808056569	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
1.0	0.590180993074	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.590181831598	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.612343240034	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.515827990308	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.589091933744	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.506811954818	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.600917989979	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.547668350271	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.540115480254	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.495266073663	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.420164137509	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.548332438747	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.553036277568	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.576314997845	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.456174781957	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.636740505224	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.466774434689	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.584948251189	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.586267269911	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.581569455874	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.648637522547	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.480301177917	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.545448740162	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.33019408391	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.535308780605	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.606757541697	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.42228069725	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.477356435351	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.518092369584	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.681947954951	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.513475911442	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.52873900797	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.358463458576	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.471736787722	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.592350378787	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.546020618829	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.549972738032	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.553743599489	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.550222044271	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.519751783605	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.32382415366	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.498164266955	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.511650152042	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.50889307405	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.510221979304	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.518613267839	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.377438274861	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.341101510168	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.320471244432	... on Larry Tribe.
1.0	0.59719888809	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.540933386945	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.453222351411	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.402847639052	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.516736939137	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.374373865876	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.55706856684	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.59364186759	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.601161604219	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.552724728063	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.536083910794	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
1.0	0.469914346519	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.547530219032	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.271723032066	Our next president...
0.0	0.446705390287	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.493226336409	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.605215013417	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.274786402344	OK, good.
0.0	0.49700150796	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.618616941073	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.609011425656	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.530869256075	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.309107709058	That's for sure.
0.0	0.408783662628	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.573826895974	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.545348113055	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
1.0	0.351262459829	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.545467313932	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.620477911993	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.563049203522	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.680796890654	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.0	Why?
0.0	0.375223463535	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.387810386096	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.523545631813	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.609009122182	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.427817360115	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.640580325154	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.601297734965	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.521352169358	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.644814543656	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
1.0	0.530968836789	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.389183907874	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.536083408596	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.559500928936	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
1.0	0.34899820466	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.611482593397	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.476777468792	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.553013585645	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.501975136826	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.308145214083	I can do that.
0.0	0.612180461676	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.472596910684	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.494242240553	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.448837448929	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.339534267747	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.534469997189	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.498982972614	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.579357348786	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.497991047804	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.557405320327	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.462262139692	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.375411881602	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.435348811861	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.585845357188	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.55828645108	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.289243176097	And here's why.
1.0	0.557297811556	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.68482444549	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.608769960878	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.637704800904	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.427426497828	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.624801110693	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.393013687783	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.548782257085	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.364972901604	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.670633586559	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.546273002659	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.472114677346	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.514862662651	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.354795989582	Here's the bottom line.
1.0	0.659760410285	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.546920356287	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
1.0	0.603512433739	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.5259545128	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.311856209546	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.289201035137	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.340924271853	Well, I mean right here.
1.0	0.552367974499	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.548627885844	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.554538232093	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.363753060193	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.54604359863	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.569286494833	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.451126847614	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.527290621373	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.332761312801	And you know what?
0.0	0.477990211838	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.605639717476	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.366620430079	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.281515009973	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.396774155475	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.45933588639	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.647140224105	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.438389600767	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.633948418683	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.45892773467	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.474949311477	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.573996032279	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.388157943045	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.477263069758	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.629082128258	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.501016454246	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.421851482119	I will run on my record all day long.
1.0	0.519402168308	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.249819067283	That is...
0.0	0.556264629043	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.339413319763	It's their money.
0.0	0.599628561479	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.50872975339	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.308536103565	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.481060907199	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.439886319808	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.477500729054	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.599080849302	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
1.0	0.446612186404	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.706670621649	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.453282950947	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.536924949805	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.477966150999	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.444067392696	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.540935730863	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.595276578767	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.529698408855	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.530445958565	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.589321769953	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.562453671855	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.38752413129	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.437078691035	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.489427333527	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.480204366376	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.488116921542	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.299324971612	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.553729962985	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.461797401158	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.501430071815	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.283037033474	Check it out.
0.0	0.497956805252	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.537629821191	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.316947184325	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.582774409652	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.601079527749	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.442294053543	We hear a lot of good plans.
1.0	0.490558909354	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.439494324337	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.611278793431	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.269054621552	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.525171788764	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.589277346787	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.439976698261	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.605658186804	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.508954200483	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.507230326221	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.333233368666	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.49977662065	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.561545553752	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.509723709088	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.396287200742	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.561778393568	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
1.0	0.280781279109	They were wrong.
0.0	0.390301608139	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.452336903354	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.492913697334	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.511175230073	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.66152790404	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.430132365477	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.412661960647	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.475867023099	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.590651707143	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.288324219563	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.410621270795	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.540097603578	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.521788493106	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.573544287639	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.413340136621	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.552719672478	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.622703727451	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.526038370782	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.550312195876	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.507968534962	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.341868849638	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.565445468095	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.466904736013	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.458428668202	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.437816527062	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.605372278561	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.591178280862	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.583416526585	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
1.0	0.423535858023	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.547515861066	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.29136475902	That's not true.
0.0	0.347572722472	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.502812737476	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.605396226817	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.5405923964	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.561724011774	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.39874810337	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.337225343233	So you know what?
0.0	0.541715157686	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.608405161224	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.551709069966	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.460265561844	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.490069114012	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.509072999836	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.291135711193	That is not right.
0.0	0.554002979178	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.511026925494	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
1.0	0.55416078896	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.449321097989	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.549895480553	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.59348975895	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.316498145174	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.526625914976	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.454751781212	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.353604773226	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.505997606996	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.480084037847	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.559955025142	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.604647187934	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.605751839594	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.496893262191	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.36724848994	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.463334392849	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.366531387955	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.511870985134	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.526612956618	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.334706168314	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.34311784543	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.434602986868	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.407526650472	Are you serious about this election?
1.0	0.669866636625	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.360562821703	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.48483210467	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.542595355241	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.411661033732	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.605779904719	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.348941615077	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.590260212207	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.302971696464	I like it.
0.0	0.317932872263	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.512245790037	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.555133158286	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.480276705342	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.476950916502	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.484755312106	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.588647983884	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.378198218325	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.374912434965	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.569717323663	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.

0.0	0.496660774704	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.495436808491	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.378150900709	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.

0.0	0.338322374425	Just for the record.
0.0	0.525059817628	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.47720562661	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.327291808835	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.421274391627	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.546799897517	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.489671772339	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.406550765748	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.462610677987	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.

0.0	0.369422878056	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.563835493139	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.550182836744	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.325883013469	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.341063583181	They're a scam.
0.0	0.497290693108	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.630405485383	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.488268740691	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.317261952278	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.361066224214	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.607202036283	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
1.0	0.579213399035	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.604900288399	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.

0.0	0.357375701501	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.400333402781	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.59357514821	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.533959040846	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.570292639942	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.414612355204	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.578935461314	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.346314399912	You know why three?
0.0	0.649527303303	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.516251604098	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.299422133131	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.662168055077	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.460621569568	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.482942645153	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.505824645027	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.433138272186	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.514813678803	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.44457419051	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.43279626127	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.550560500365	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.514272577636	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.576295358873	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.683121976027	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.52480872131	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.539580097965	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.425749203655	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.30972189147	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.580502598847	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.465802736577	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.477919783995	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.349469715065	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.54530513912	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.57296408649	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.257377351164	You did.
0.0	0.605421463356	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.427015354132	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.308919982642	I changed that.
0.0	0.536056867478	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.436611395162	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.431839412305	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.508857016271	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.477371976829	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.396329375024	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.353301906799	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.509684004353	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.329085389869	You're simply not.
0.0	0.496171927451	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.507469791547	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.534708289649	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.554858273052	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.522121203946	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.443007232153	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.532462013545	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.280188052463	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.631964186196	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.581433893876	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.377484164269	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.362453823237	I never said that.
0.0	0.433479166529	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.503341673161	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.563267183904	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.501872136378	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.458989537759	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.385500855023	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.57911632975	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.383841997344	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.377632378792	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.630358149898	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.516280519715	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
1.0	0.639223946222	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.50056923315	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.402605496861	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.400299180611	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.351525138583	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.54905448337	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.439214129124	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
1.0	0.526400316963	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.390058167598	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.480148921311	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.574786342461	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.611151526981	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.591877653735	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.52544922887	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.416210446465	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.473637477307	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.624998678373	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.593512661133	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.317691328781	She said the truth.
0.0	0.446500364042	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.359447703949	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.510652480678	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.356272708944	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.557524362658	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.384879600046	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.452475726618	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.342662983245	The world has changed.
0.0	0.49208304958	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
1.0	0.622060350811	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.30457374063	We're running.
0.0	0.56480103759	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.27007435939	...No, sir...
0.0	0.34772860412	How do I know this?
0.0	0.429825778347	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.28417494597	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.566513149989	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.471759226656	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.666877573024	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.305851289088	That has not been...
0.0	0.400956438634	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.47019409517	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.402973688119	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.582139341089	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.556415699785	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.379263323201	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.479815826248	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.56692944971	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.558551035561	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.610728177114	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.35713395331	We are not France.
0.0	0.589418783349	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.446308971383	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.533111801634	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.581653270205	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.6126396997	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.232567364564	But...
0.0	0.463840524025	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.540995913348	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.544491342371	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.385435004803	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.40642022143	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.649231215986	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.466670536825	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.543496733512	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.600660723901	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.477704445209	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.650634071738	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.596245691492	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.567908613662	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.446021322427	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.

0.0	0.595546721645	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.515508660436	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.525737966454	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.499826505489	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.582934316745	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.543372899046	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.49875249409	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.480443860601	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.464467578855	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.528856183311	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.391710689585	And, we said no.
0.0	0.43189439082	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.575533652966	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.557905816525	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.464657696014	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.519591043787	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.425354769945	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.604028415762	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.475375577566	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.451795292315	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.559199220413	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.471127311099	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.362453823237	I never said that.
0.0	0.414853922533	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.4577364123	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.519410668452	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.554383106883	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.545345615593	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.534301229291	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.456033395809	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.380353036833	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.678802504412	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.521111696982	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.557258704888	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.453656455293	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.486549221383	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.558647678286	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.563909266052	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.512773791504	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.614313146081	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.514065052454	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.372056559294	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.358316647415	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.31898265154	The number of women --
0.0	0.423629822888	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.443416223225	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.498860666058	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.567558994591	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.550747388005	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.400349416055	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.638053662984	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.467765954586	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.391023575702	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.551891340434	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.543298262657	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.552756663037	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.492508036283	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.45399295493	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.438119985024	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.606535028587	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.313661943335	And God bless America.
0.0	0.563779735863	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.302148514663	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.457630320568	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.336456469528	But I would add this.
0.0	0.462341997236	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.385991340227	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.483660380714	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.529584425841	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.51604507726	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.5	Of course not.
0.0	0.445642401502	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.610266192012	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.338363592465	I will not do that.
0.0	0.561850717429	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.529361087553	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.588957444816	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.290914147702	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.597415215481	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.553471816451	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.40959210803	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.514944626594	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
1.0	0.252381665738	That's wrong.
0.0	0.349465967065	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.360211874254	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.31106900541	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.547039570608	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.640859396764	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.337250906579	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.565054735811	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.515127977188	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.581808211412	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.583788718893	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.509343498822	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.605865922715	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.578773406739	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.478816144858	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.402098728325	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.297490923023	...income tax...
0.0	0.612485400242	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.457656480329	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.584927359298	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.47105597437	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.521832663515	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.34798209376	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.450270885095	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.481817378987	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.385255667756	That's what I said.
0.0	0.5583793761	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.599372347922	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.296007906499	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.570451757913	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.580446536503	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.576162910439	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.360958164744	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.510352819007	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.47590128739	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.655689950151	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.231420036339	Again...
0.0	0.63798144946	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.53604046009	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.496236082243	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.402490633836	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.369962283186	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.397489263443	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.418715820207	We cannot be the world's policeman.
1.0	0.527036118786	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.496202219356	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.0	...John...
0.0	0.511986706256	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.394947869137	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.327773630846	I've laid out...
0.0	0.517017608862	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.370419451568	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.505203010541	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.594486501937	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.462376238936	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.488941391542	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.362431726137	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.37812965938	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.529844653325	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.629207544366	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.482079677896	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.581026219443	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
1.0	0.568152818343	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.62442302666	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.309002899501	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.415748068153	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.510604598299	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.374889817534	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.535131488979	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.567317267908	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.381579248204	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.571482167786	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.517336417299	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.533174370285	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.616235305687	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.501639461347	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.273379563893	I do.
0.0	0.360608245414	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.56509929313	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.482428983462	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.504083139721	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.524763297352	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.269869655162	That is important.
0.0	0.569416549694	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.372433089249	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.512975944253	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.48549052375	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
1.0	0.531903433517	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.442634599413	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.438493632006	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.41073199336	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.0	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.292184533896	You're welcome.
0.0	0.52517204892	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.559002951486	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.480904995938	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.574120343889	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.575055062752	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.512446945638	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
1.0	0.600943380031	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.564681705425	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.492219227366	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.49773608372	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.515310141727	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.597505300508	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.414045563566	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.559089845626	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.458989537759	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.474958643287	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.540639119677	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.

0.0	0.459062462917	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.520761713234	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.67102203821	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.

0.0	0.343932148962	He is a good man.
0.0	0.460893745845	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.40934668046	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.463309435167	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.44555131499	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.382127026738	We're up 347,000 jobs.

0.0	0.47478845868	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.57260789708	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.28199903965	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.54939209598	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.547765868164	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.569385997435	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.340611495789	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.521722235691	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.0	...Chris...
0.0	0.562387403037	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.546352065605	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.284744606534	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.376045340189	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.5115854988	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.582910913391	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.438381756531	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.608411628863	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.523867445413	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.543655201762	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.591600548674	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.535969223861	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.563117408003	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.387153733638	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.239421205894	These...
0.0	0.529690159941	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.539728673258	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.43902702104	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.

0.0	0.461691924296	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.373558098417	They're off to China.
1.0	0.493063595857	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.344593782841	Well, yes, indeed.

0.0	0.302933809277	We need sound money.
0.0	0.609893370317	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.518526360028	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.639450674028	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.

0.0	0.545563796805	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.492302894744	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.373172492632	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.43164551462	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.

0.0	0.348180120716	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.589112773065	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.304351635765	How great is that?
0.0	0.304888937519	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.575518782776	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.512283473865	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.

0.0	0.351483604853	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.480475071105	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.598882351978	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.

0.0	0.339834520549	Take it from your professors...

0.0	0.332235639541	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.518590121968	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.513554931936	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.0	Alright.

0.0	0.368571101681	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.606074620678	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.398021486098	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.569352519243	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.481624090012	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.440264931319	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.585299514645	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.385787051961	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.580497679995	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.

0.0	0.595797628268	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.541528554516	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.565930818255	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.332068133599	And for good cause.
0.0	0.48002036218	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
1.0	0.69797524985	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.544848087295	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.

0.0	0.427794192294	That's what I'm working towards.

0.0	0.409787439655	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
1.0	0.572915898661	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
1.0	0.624513670681	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.527322822905	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.510845300871	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.431090581542	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.557839154375	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.441234907194	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.412153869378	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.404339541497	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.543986034808	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.536830936595	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.541751283405	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.508741648927	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.524464669589	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.518989884673	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.478228758786	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.271313678663	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.457756918013	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.582294232894	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.498631184142	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.355567687629	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.448260221715	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.376034405701	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.507407382377	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.274434381352	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.564684067427	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.396821744602	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.639265145761	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.598168563396	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.543692145988	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.446568693278	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.523416183424	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.35375137795	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.510552606351	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.541588454309	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.614391829198	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.395368126913	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.474818921414	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.603496971638	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.495491326604	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.517403705817	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.420263355458	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
1.0	0.600660723901	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
1.0	0.591393160731	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.607498190246	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.500165636166	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.413025798395	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.518205677349	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.414956181167	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.578750600124	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.341437843259	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.600287546247	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.5255068407	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.38770303283	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.54986535079	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.541421552675	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.

0.0	0.49968453886	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.555736736955	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.599493173955	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.384903081077	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.420438692084	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.473056363479	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.566520398748	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.402368688062	It is time to believe in America again.

0.0	0.580237893499	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?

0.0	0.632477941247	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.245590488347	Say again?
