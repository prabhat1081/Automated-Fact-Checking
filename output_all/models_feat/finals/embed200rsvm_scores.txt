0.0	0.0512266861902	You know, Ted didn't show up.
0.0	0.406559788641	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.341116626435	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.599136438126	And that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity -- kill people who are unarmed who should not be killed, they must be held accountable.
0.0	0.217484463107	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.135690054251	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.371482525424	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.252028156891	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.112873569912	So Hillary and I have a difference.
0.0	0.338502277884	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.0298004870463	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.637161961785	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.319910846889	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.23161814215	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.
0.0	0.0828013762661	May I respond?
0.0	0.161247205754	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.229937499856	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.
0.0	0.134948780712	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.367480056278	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.51762052221	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
0.0	0.421920435926	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.0133597397391	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.634925351098	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.329411594069	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.169326696402	I'm going to tell you -- thank you.
0.0	0.127261280061	They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.
0.0	0.259716695258	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.450906698319	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.380284752931	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.42034421933	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.19474990668	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.424953811877	And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young, old, everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard.
0.0	0.288579615406	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.126871046079	Al Qaida was based in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.0796460664916	You bet they do.
0.0	0.0447981582785	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.050084680216	All right.
0.0	0.399850080589	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.161803173019	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.0300600620662	I don't like that.
0.0	0.0667343188304	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.55501072273	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.0864249363187	And the answer is: Because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda.
0.0	0.0153265533654	We listen to you and -- and then we act.
0.0	0.0265344836312	slot.
0.0	0.14622726071	Very valuable.
0.0	0.208399884352	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.292308013769	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.128946497694	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.225415888661	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.342886491543	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.186612510213	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.190899125919	We bailed out Wall Street.
0.0	0.398485157151	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.0709385273546	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.246669805926	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.097603812451	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.315412261432	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.22994156695	I would just...
0.0	0.0224071549374	And God bless America.
0.0	0.485806326136	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.402791991676	They had a plan that was good.
0.0	0.147457663826	We are already de-conflicting air space.
0.0	0.1327815775	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.0845105337929	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.444359541036	When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.428534051388	Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place.
0.0	0.424197858973	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.226425409903	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.293909802998	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.0582746576811	And we should be a welcoming nation.
0.0	0.123847216811	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.129622820973	But they're killing us economically.
0.0	0.619419751929	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
0.0	0.0768764104592	That's the future of banking in America.
0.0	0.553345876721	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.367544522448	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.170386091273	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.0989772396751	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.443560115037	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.228995509659	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.219563617407	I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.
0.0	0.0307110676953	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.631307204807	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.215251101457	The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.
0.0	0.198796693581	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.146504792024	There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better.
0.0	0.117521245005	... and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.191637130089	Again...
0.0	0.0425535479847	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.0372602356097	Don't know that.
0.0	0.0704908453492	I've gotta do it."
0.0	0.180042544115	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.509355691495	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.149903046029	We've been at this a couple of years.
0.0	0.070372990782	We're dying.
0.0	0.400224482601	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.229985118974	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.0299343944004	But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that.
0.0	0.0595219820486	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.564325462346	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.421937131649	When he brought forward the "Gang of Eight" bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.
0.0	0.277810575846	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
0.0	0.30772321396	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.
1.0	0.166768062831	I think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street...
0.0	0.315093290808	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.442565325249	I watched the video of Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.0809533328978	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.0379073854583	We all understand that.
0.0	0.0728454256061	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.10168516945	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.108515533466	... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message.
1.0	0.981781898876	A $5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.338807845609	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.160244930858	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
0.0	0.345765170997	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.246053689548	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.00520006412935	No, he doesn't.
1.0	0.97968607008	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
0.0	0.0582099079117	That's the difference.
0.0	0.164644859803	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.30389505833	We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.
0.0	0.016051683822	it won't happen.
0.0	0.906922074918	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.246793863735	And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them.
0.0	0.255982571153	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.0724015903122	Thank you.
0.0	0.515351264985	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.145521395145	I would like to see it updated.
0.0	0.0514012668108	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.673506814531	Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.
0.0	0.396041783326	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.138106231069	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.674123504917	I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains.
0.0	0.111083137454	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.183223100799	It cannot solely be America's fight.
0.0	0.0951664455979	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.464250357021	We got it done in my state by leading with principal and that's what we need to do as a party for comprehensive gun safety.
0.0	0.357974538846	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.0325891838735	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.
0.0	0.397136640092	We have to do away with the strawman proposal.
0.0	0.450345387026	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.111585953462	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.204841519378	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
0.0	0.283055683007	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
0.0	0.5	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.273093897136	That means education.
0.0	0.140810324263	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.280453242709	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.555168464113	No hour is too short, no dollar too small.
0.0	0.721634633455	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.192975643044	And, also, acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration, and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners.
0.0	0.514362966316	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.091595057569	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.0724015903122	Thank you.
0.0	0.158563849023	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.171144867729	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.550928810405	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.562064531585	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.393910320394	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.135791641591	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.0548232755698	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.362119334232	I think we need major reform in the military, making it more cost effective, but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us.
0.0	0.21066090373	I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
0.0	0.215840397366	Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.
0.0	0.0996204880346	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.233900296569	Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice.
0.0	0.0667656737816	Yeah.
0.0	0.896691380849	Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.
0.0	0.0724015903122	Thank you.
0.0	0.291596879568	For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check.
0.0	0.228078412211	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.298884273386	And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that.
0.0	0.292873813867	I started off -- thank you -- I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said -- and I love my father.
0.0	0.394946071507	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.23011333857	So I believe that, in fact, this country needs to move towards a living wage.
0.0	0.147045160188	... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before.
0.0	0.12788967221	That's the job.
0.0	0.317091317487	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
0.0	0.106886444132	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.382782823729	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.0828075681187	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.383662630696	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.224250790272	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.654284702332	But at the end of the day, what you have right now are millions of Americans working two or three jobs because their wages that they are earning are just too low.
0.0	0.450211306085	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.127073244244	Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day.
0.0	0.20286786694	We should be supportive of that effort.
0.0	0.0287153889543	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.050084680216	That's not right.
0.0	0.266420124809	And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.
0.0	0.060635966001	I said, "I don't need it.
0.0	0.537204420095	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.476434810825	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.165682443797	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.472530227155	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
0.0	0.112001348461	We get a traitor.

0.0	0.241485260165	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.265429085531	It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them.
0.0	0.315239952401	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.245924521843	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.137924359215	And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.
1.0	0.993722899946	This small country has welcomed in many refugees.
0.0	0.167307895338	Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.

0.0	0.191569952074	Yes.
1.0	0.982919666425	We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.
0.0	0.310741121018	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.310249324305	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.152576230693	It's nice.
0.0	0.0385947927738	OK?
0.0	0.133765886285	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.713725039121	And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.
0.0	0.089581705768	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.
0.0	0.0084219752985	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.138707166292	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.
0.0	0.12647810793	We need new leadership.
0.0	0.0918071850159	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.22115001944	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.0866445603794	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.13704370414	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.0171225052338	I don't think so.
0.0	0.191637130089	How about this?
0.0	0.349576731027	And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.
0.0	0.788444910175	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.510332138995	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.855452407101	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.0937963930627	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.191637130089	I have.
0.0	0.520296386928	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.152886317194	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.958592767665	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.160946629118	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.2349006585	I said, "how's it going?"
0.0	0.969124202646	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.191637130089	...
0.0	0.142573746862	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.0705974465447	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.469443386133	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.17937825757	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.69704468465	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.383773951743	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.17485537225	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.0612012364048	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.247474532341	Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.265466009898	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.337958539422	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.488426892616	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.129733864639	Well, let's take it one at a time.
0.0	0.116284083416	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.189958711216	What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.
0.0	0.450170900327	My daughters went to college on a mountain of bills.
0.0	0.21974755152	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.0350891006591	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.036945449821	The Turks are being threatened.
0.0	0.17316090087	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
1.0	0.974547567319	Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.
0.0	0.883506526999	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
1.0	0.347026364537	We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.595550959887	But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it.
0.0	0.304907367283	If the United States does not lead, there is not another leader.
0.0	0.0485065970075	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.372894572249	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.269649246918	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.206101833321	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.149901493632	Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare?
0.0	0.236814391814	You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country.
0.0	0.264095134418	Nobody can do that like me.
0.0	0.00411774563622	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
0.0	0.0599239098314	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
0.0	0.0618621222051	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.341945010513	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.139558612472	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.5774645051	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.104627855269	They thought something was wrong.
0.0	0.191637130089	...
0.0	0.00335852782946	You find me...
0.0	0.072207258436	Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.
0.0	0.153574085237	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.122547692679	The Secretary's obviously right.
0.0	0.25395586239	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.211131730078	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.

0.0	0.3460933392	I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks.
0.0	0.0595321126391	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.331933235158	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.114252065908	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.185602204243	I've had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say, I don't agree with you on everything, but I like what you do.
0.0	0.86115844258	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.128773138096	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.103675923942	I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.

0.0	0.0557151814277	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.217500577261	We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up.
0.0	0.11356539905	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.179112182171	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.149026947719	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.492683880895	We have one House member from Vermont, three candidates in the race.
0.0	0.176874572208	I'm meeting with three of them in the next week.
0.0	0.303741178471	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.0287153889543	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.942874558206	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.0255309551812	We want to build on it and fix it.
0.0	0.216135026042	I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.
0.0	0.273160283108	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.225499166781	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
1.0	0.988800981265	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
0.0	0.330988563327	But the poll numbers have.
1.0	0.802804597256	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.214919250264	You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet...
0.0	0.386790479103	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.217284659425	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.265133890067	As Americans, we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet, but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies, to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability.
0.0	0.10528521244	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.451952198197	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.328823735401	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.232581439918	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.0943218337404	I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria.
0.0	0.0333830375988	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.211805688357	What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.
0.0	0.451555157438	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.207118254851	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.624768027936	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.288195520182	We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be -- and -- and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody.
0.0	0.34361926353	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.347197482329	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.0251675599333	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.0932142954721	And what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.745032852254	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.461564235928	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.194867356977	This is an emergency.
0.0	0.969965920345	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.927802590473	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.690062655333	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.0133597397391	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.104789215552	And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem.
0.0	0.468028563365	And it has three parts.
0.0	0.711188869476	I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil.
0.0	0.412842954505	We have to end -- education has to be local.
0.0	0.903846600142	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.409120025613	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.418537255557	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.
0.0	0.137057514675	They're killing us.
0.0	0.0809291603956	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.171849289897	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.834820297421	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.167570500878	And Abdullah said something recently, very important.
0.0	0.885168670407	Thousands.
0.0	0.451157351523	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.126421711403	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.131463175777	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.33876473139	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.0812071179192	And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition, including Russia, to help us destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.0879925106223	It's a joke.
0.0	0.217116132227	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.33429811074	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.34217326727	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.0905969227573	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.
1.0	0.966510795031	Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.
0.0	0.138855672899	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
1.0	0.995222178073	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.2423200558	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.0992420564503	If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.
0.0	0.172364092658	They are not going to go away on their own.
0.0	0.228378359815	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.218799041302	I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
0.0	0.207046133218	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.236668962401	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.237682542249	And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting.
0.0	0.155863829867	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.482466398498	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
0.0	0.3166387298	I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.
0.0	0.056780056331	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.366791992263	And I understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary.
0.0	0.899354305591	Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day.
0.0	0.0687872256402	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.
0.0	0.0300600620662	They don't like that.
0.0	0.050084666679	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.0549631629373	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.062077159014	Oh.
0.0	0.0551062887064	Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.
0.0	0.331896275261	Well, you know, governor, I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010.
0.0	0.106187683322	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.0487575134829	That is why we need to make...
0.0	0.716733740441	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.614471080655	You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.
0.0	0.0302517245786	And guess what?
0.0	0.200925372773	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.308648683331	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.00520006412935	You don't have to.
0.0	0.604987468253	Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military.
0.0	0.540875237701	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.241542730136	Marco opposed this because they made a deal.
0.0	0.489270719696	And people are saying, "What's going on?
1.0	0.807460952193	And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent.
0.0	0.153030619872	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.457555865899	It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.
0.0	0.202965055304	They like to ask direct questions.
0.0	0.0640892889439	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.10180791261	We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?
0.0	0.796939025271	Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server.
0.0	0.163329732504	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.050084680216	Right.
0.0	0.0636667893263	We saw that in Egypt.
0.0	0.686476778245	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.676286414643	But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
0.0	0.410077151347	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.188887434429	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.538341885227	John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.
0.0	0.344021229827	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.539380704442	They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
0.0	0.239546608807	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.85591610653	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.4530594715	That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable.
0.0	0.221546383522	I think this is a very difficult issue.
0.0	0.58743384413	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.372674816333	But I have another one, Ford.
0.0	0.093981701272	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
1.0	0.335497227249	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.122930971536	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.112168365763	I like it.
0.0	0.0581911446591	They were wrong.
0.0	0.0667656737816	Yeah.
0.0	0.577216954631	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.0413992688029	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.0169525274994	But I would add this.
0.0	0.0570501317707	We can build the fence.
0.0	0.257642325703	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.27875403435	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.786989425702	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.975298719527	You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent.
0.0	0.0770499899073	You learn that threats always change.
0.0	0.629282115018	I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.
0.0	0.262845877389	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.304814734133	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.182373909379	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.126674066642	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.191637130089	So...
0.0	0.23134463332	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.514895837959	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.207221450135	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.212905644462	I think I'm actually a very nice person."
0.0	0.319583488829	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.0926096826638	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.150542003265	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.
0.0	0.209866222202	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.701326529719	That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.6241233626	They're controlled fully -- they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
0.0	0.0597028133606	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.16260959155	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.34935898201	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.328914701889	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.678018090507	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.17774988494	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.128225804214	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.445948511107	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.16464779331	When was the last time you heard China is killing us?
0.0	0.442455795108	May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care?
0.0	0.10599989726	Well, I just want to quickly add...
0.0	0.544750981221	Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable?
0.0	0.0173091402858	We have the opposite thinking.
0.0	0.352826077724	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.5	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.177440444509	Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.
0.0	0.653389439601	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.403885223915	But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector.
1.0	0.996355386612	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.0804853714005	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.575669970958	The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress.
0.0	0.191637130089	...
0.0	0.880606790024	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.575425162824	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.317453999014	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.464039355407	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.
0.0	0.105329495767	Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate.
0.0	0.300596000533	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.400157252655	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.949138091762	And remember the $5 billion Web site?
0.0	0.223932589107	All of these are very difficult issues.
0.0	0.0868376021858	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.187046598504	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
0.0	0.112820712574	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.0725618763038	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.329328150418	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.166588124322	Well, thanks for having me.
0.0	0.209568472288	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.

0.0	0.534986003619	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.0188324321033	We need that thinking.
0.0	0.133706148332	What have you got now?

0.0	0.191637130089	You do.

0.0	0.519204853774	As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.
0.0	0.253212602454	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).

0.0	0.138232485391	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.236585882649	I don't get any money from Wall Street.
0.0	0.0226928270902	Wait for what?
0.0	0.108293121572	We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
0.0	0.286408781868	I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.
0.0	0.343717007722	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.239110222625	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.134092801722	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.492275092105	I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.
0.0	0.0647316243172	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.

0.0	0.210510028037	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.109930410792	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.258134803085	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.

0.0	0.949086527825	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.0995403454895	But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said.
0.0	0.434901744154	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.131617346691	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.250291504917	Dynamically.

1.0	0.983768168428	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.

0.0	0.195624640557	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.288558816105	John.
0.0	0.206519943093	Check it out.
0.0	0.360631215275	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.372580411111	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.41499704483	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.
0.0	0.104316578943	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.196750021024	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.
0.0	0.050084680216	That's right.
0.0	0.127572782596	We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.
0.0	0.264155436808	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.0911924499434	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.35258887091	Saudi Arabia without us is gone.
0.0	0.041431307888	So I've watched the politicians.
0.0	0.217679604038	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.590682231875	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.868891781124	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.279718187748	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.113033482496	I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.
0.0	0.542594289899	And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.
0.0	0.914301591505	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
1.0	0.993311104257	And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.
0.0	0.185241580933	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.933902312473	We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government.
0.0	0.105760599245	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.134857757759	We can have debt-free college in the United States.
0.0	0.0684479258436	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.
0.0	0.37133499077	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.21000322427	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.293483299935	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.152672609942	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.312826524119	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.0656216703393	Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.
0.0	0.0726527139928	Let me just -- let me just...
0.0	0.179565468552	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.159604711239	I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace.
0.0	0.0483864348201	Please go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.247433986881	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.28773943767	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.0615852657518	You know that.
0.0	0.265132741654	... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.0624990746166	We need to figure this out together.
0.0	0.261436053315	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.32961444647	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.331884965744	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.858716678303	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.0106744647219	But it will be...
0.0	0.0724015903122	Thank you.
0.0	0.184204614145	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.0965503057331	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.547603775528	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.557309812308	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.132322742408	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.191637130089	No.
0.0	0.123785239357	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.914382184865	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.0915891116921	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.181605039625	There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out.
0.0	0.0304864742036	Chris?
0.0	0.114098470436	And look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that.
0.0	0.649296039148	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.0744458975286	You know, I've always had a great deal of respect.
0.0	0.545884991906	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.488452709132	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.262043191204	And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.
0.0	0.0844148271795	You do legislation.
0.0	0.365758694964	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.288856424235	And some, I assume, are good people.
0.0	0.965780620683	We increased education funding by 37 percent.
0.0	0.459922868657	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.163373332103	But states need to do more as well.
0.0	0.206598454228	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.884800817591	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
0.0	0.397723495527	We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.100845881153	They are going to have to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.164209779256	They can't even answer simple questions.
0.0	0.300744766722	They started in Iowa.
0.0	0.0361490187275	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.00662494514113	I won't be doing that.
0.0	0.0680203893381	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.299922890878	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.0615852657518	I know.
0.0	0.226672903985	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.316151545645	We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.
0.0	0.666331636341	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.129965279387	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.14808159872	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.211894009596	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.0385947927738	OK.
0.0	0.291884227228	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.0615852657518	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.14503651644	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.205526976107	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.684922595974	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.356576662534	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.0756873376293	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.386743762209	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.0171225052338	No, I don't think so.
0.0	0.0557432032908	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.684709825199	It had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.490337332452	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.157824644451	There's too much -- it's like -- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
0.0	0.22284240533	You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911.
0.0	0.0523014353505	We overcame the NRA's objections.
0.0	0.405478587687	He's actually a negative force.
0.0	0.339132543243	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.166886501599	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.239731226069	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.842100090898	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.0773966816259	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.924511108281	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.119358188283	And I -- I thought, if I didn't jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this.
0.0	0.25896824201	Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, "Rand, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.292968465851	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.385673893452	We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party.
0.0	0.404497485646	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.0950195400968	That's a drag on the economy.
0.0	0.0268416441915	And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.
0.0	0.14326079413	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.168651914923	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.
0.0	0.12812906341	How are these people gonna lead us?
0.0	0.258832948209	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.229584985026	At the same time we're doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform.
0.0	0.395830795428	Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values.
0.0	0.219926340054	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.926440385609	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.209056593934	And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.
0.0	0.191637130089	Megyn?
0.0	0.0974010512047	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.158618593298	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.399492836339	The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.216920724206	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.193181991248	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.256024558066	You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes.
0.0	0.849903689152	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.5	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.382557529027	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.37484269016	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.289861170447	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.19869081885	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.311951707328	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.321575778646	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.182524254105	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
0.0	0.160104120494	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.135589464962	Let's put the gun makers and sellers on notice that they're not going to get away with it.
0.0	0.422582150908	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
1.0	0.98915619876	Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?
0.0	0.134442138657	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.635665394991	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.179822234385	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.0419344754682	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.404275185719	So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out.
0.0	0.265574182922	But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.
0.0	0.116817871933	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.0615852657518	And you know what?
0.0	0.363280916334	We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended.
0.0	0.22032926667	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.189410953304	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.
0.0	0.562018073216	Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.
0.0	0.268865785408	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.0483468262678	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.0572121174161	They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America.
0.0	0.165418239229	And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.
0.0	0.127863257454	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.155982585063	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.158114313171	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.0465355773597	It's not great again.
0.0	0.481117648502	I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
0.0	0.0806456406314	We have got to come forward with a consensus that in fact will work.
0.0	0.731382369978	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.573653353337	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
0.0	0.0994066706644	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.22723109371	And it has been amazing to me.
0.0	0.139457384406	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.438375043922	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.72591640224	At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.
0.0	0.151742033233	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.0656320608789	You don't serve us.
0.0	0.207627772232	Give people a chance.
0.0	0.553184072341	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.0595386915885	You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches.
0.0	0.127324588404	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.140413717189	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.342408595754	I mean, my dad went to college on a G.I.
0.0	0.208203153135	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.10580586563	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.191637130089	But...
0.0	0.388373712234	I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.
0.0	0.200612090613	I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.
0.0	0.112399156084	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.0322539506574	And that's what's happening.
0.0	0.17534400014	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.258915487765	But it was also the cascading effects that followed that.
0.0	0.191637130089	...
0.0	0.191637130089	Why is that?
0.0	0.389700313171	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.486790870595	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.472430965617	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.128986699653	Are you not running?
0.0	0.288558816105	John?
0.0	0.169537594947	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.394183604838	I've prosecuted terrorists.
0.0	0.443027211728	Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors.
0.0	0.5	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.0155680146582	So be very, very careful.
0.0	0.0485744573133	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.553288165939	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.407453542046	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.0188624005433	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.102759882899	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.185285057472	I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party's nominee.
0.0	0.367267826872	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.368200315491	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.123432513374	We went after those who had attacked us.
0.0	0.706402619272	I've employed -- I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
0.0	0.138486587721	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.037712904354	... And start taking advice...
0.0	0.0464878758844	You have a bigger problem with China.
0.0	0.0302517245786	And guess what?
0.0	0.175058847802	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.198651485231	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.230679128279	When we put money into the hands of working people, they're going to go out and buy goods, they're going to buy services and they're going to create jobs in doing that.
0.0	0.35742632215	Of course the United States must lead.
0.0	0.0459226356056	I like Marco Rubio.
1.0	0.999998854908	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.408870545167	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.668153208331	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.279689639226	That is a pledge that I'm making.
0.0	0.0585945391107	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.125353474204	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.471025734846	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.582560380252	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.0263589535908	Can you believe this?
0.0	0.540879960022	Number two, we had a really good plan.
0.0	0.365988242866	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.131575762827	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.206310833726	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.101008422331	When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.
0.0	0.230618126025	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.06941715131	Look at my family.
0.0	0.281349184915	And, here's what she said to the American people.
0.0	0.103419062484	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.030874407696	Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
0.0	0.97563044369	But you would index it -- you would index it to the median wage.
0.0	0.483361121105	I -- you know, know that Senator Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers.
0.0	0.389141396317	Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin.
0.0	0.0814369016068	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.437161151681	It's virtually useless.
0.0	0.024699542861	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.24188596426	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.293180487952	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.987358773476	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.0404691730317	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.289341357291	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.390534125717	I think it's fair to say that Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America, but the issue is...
0.0	0.134078375756	Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope.
0.0	0.105277318806	I'm ready.
0.0	0.119917185213	Now I'm not doing that...I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?
0.0	0.699130929416	Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.164809356834	I mean, that's a fact.
0.0	0.122511269853	Can I just say this...
0.0	0.318307949505	ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.
0.0	0.438708399179	So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act.
0.0	0.174536547103	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.392468823192	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
1.0	0.93606503727	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.0830308206503	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.0675340695852	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.191637130089	That is...
0.0	0.397273170285	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.21363538537	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.0691385959705	I said, "I don't know."
0.0	0.404611388315	And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty.
0.0	0.442754560168	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.245821382804	And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party, but of President Obama.
0.0	0.382078625429	And I was determined to do everything that I could to make VA health care the best in the world, to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending.
0.0	0.105316233592	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.150297937231	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.414900961266	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.210103691809	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.128178106461	First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.
0.0	0.279441859638	How can you get people to vote for you?"
0.0	0.29017951587	You have all of these disastrous airports.
0.0	0.110834297358	So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.
0.0	0.246986067226	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.0593860965218	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.242168084385	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.160083786424	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.476946559617	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.00469758867169	We can't.
0.0	0.222136264648	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.215431612314	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.274080463662	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
0.0	0.0905508873447	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.050084680216	Right.
0.0	0.183977954	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.104778453293	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.396017967982	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.128690938055	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.279553637625	It all will be scrutinized.
0.0	0.40241834791	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.162834853887	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.078695287524	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.437446605648	Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that's not good enough.
0.0	0.207425154757	There are no simple solutions.
0.0	0.291825943671	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.0630003222479	Becky --
0.0	0.14437593732	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.128316693111	Your prosecute criminals.
1.0	0.348251404197	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.192811647151	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.164459130353	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.301607322705	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.927958065126	We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally.
0.0	0.279884089436	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.139606840992	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.348847798373	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.178127284325	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.277320435141	All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.
0.0	0.252877941135	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.685627279573	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.159613792082	We'll be filing it right on time.
0.0	0.12917734438	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.868350146219	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.125702746406	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
0.0	0.125299167876	We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear.
0.0	0.703511331913	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.159474929672	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.263243600379	We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.
0.0	0.0121543791098	He can't have it both ways.
0.0	0.158509255401	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.
0.0	0.0435177573255	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.302576594475	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.0295779716921	they expect to get something.
0.0	0.270970767574	But this is what we also have to say.
0.0	0.0167080591045	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.212578683879	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.275242378866	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.960158280111	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.967545944207	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.284667744599	And he asked me to support that.
0.0	0.256319752103	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.0495395825514	You're right.
0.0	0.289271641878	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.231856456301	Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.0752411567828	... Well, no, no.
0.0	0.348590659373	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.39103901524	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.00564620486149	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.0868924290511	Now I want to go back something.
0.0	0.353920359531	There's no nation on earth that comes close to that number.
0.0	0.166116172162	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.111390311621	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.0761628502836	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.00457973607403	David...
0.0	0.387653757368	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
0.0	0.23797636182	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.662629568238	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.154989287528	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.175829024817	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.225588221946	Number one, we're going to keep ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.455751399974	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.207047068323	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
1.0	0.674985402569	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.279737836652	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.147440235169	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.0245095459059	Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.
0.0	0.2506945304	So, yes, this has developed.
0.0	0.591725979137	We haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.
0.0	0.673266744355	According to the economists -- who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying -- that $24 trillion -- we're very close -- that's the point of no return.
0.0	0.408699612655	So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.
0.0	0.0217365823334	We don't need that.
0.0	0.105043241512	But you don't hear that from anybody else.
0.0	0.582928040538	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.438072015387	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.615751918209	I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.201808591765	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.335880228952	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.0542071256057	We must anticipate these threats before they happen.
0.0	0.055568581765	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.00225896574762	Reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.212114392522	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.153156578635	My plan is there.
0.0	0.568388384895	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.115664412767	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.15542271877	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
1.0	0.891781494928	That's wrong.
0.0	0.0726527139928	Let me just...
0.0	0.0641141722188	... against Islam -- radical Islam -- if you're not for border security.
0.0	0.0517176294248	We don't win.
0.0	0.034121824943	Listen, we can solve immigration.
0.0	0.81665436071	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.725546786097	Illegal.
0.0	0.010857748413	So did you, Marco.
0.0	0.13009487122	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.0724015903122	Thank you.
0.0	0.683005688782	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.656598096103	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.509219237162	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.383299353865	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.365629633378	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.163010910363	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.197515119349	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.152578567685	We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president.
0.0	0.238333705376	Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.
0.0	0.486999324194	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.306389322825	You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?
0.0	0.240021344873	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.309012431281	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.149787145362	We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.
0.0	0.767751591096	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
1.0	0.97288059241	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.16046787505	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.0827472832364	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.193077995002	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.615147819412	I am proud that I was the first member of Congress to take Americans over the Canadian border to buy breast cancer drugs for one-tenth the price they were paying in the United States.
0.0	0.118548281164	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
0.0	0.110920037692	We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations.
0.0	0.300978971225	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.0921144403612	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.153639863675	We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.
0.0	0.599401041973	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.360885938804	I never said that.
0.0	0.406032702067	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0977478712842	And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.
0.0	0.129269169743	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.154376548637	And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in.
0.0	0.739772485915	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.280841655978	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.208848455099	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.142671851464	We actually took action to do these things and as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families.
0.0	0.812487878208	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.40189366486	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
0.0	0.335073526038	That is our government today.
0.0	0.236890708926	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.0648536013736	We don't need more of the same solutions.
0.0	0.577284489361	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.236966163282	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.0385947927738	OK.
0.0	0.236864070698	You know why three?
0.0	0.249917271836	Let's do more -- let's do more than reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.301730274768	I met recently with some members of the Chaldean Christian communities and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months.
0.0	0.676981065011	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.817731389133	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.376822189801	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.191872551144	I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?
0.0	0.191569952074	Yes.
0.0	0.061935179536	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.0952819601063	No, Martha, I would not.
0.0	0.181453670045	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.342306747626	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.268250631548	Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.
0.0	0.558311829682	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.105471076649	...before I go.
0.0	0.0711603361283	Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.137888696766	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.191637130089	Not at all.
0.0	0.307420622508	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.221988457628	Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid.
0.0	0.201360272281	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.191637130089	I have...
0.0	0.102287197611	We need to move aggressively now.
0.0	0.0378486446226	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.458067782899	But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone.
0.0	0.53878581788	And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.
0.0	0.124617602939	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.146991252733	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.61803689296	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?
0.0	0.163481247451	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.981781898876	$5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.45739165599	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.282575989363	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.0884452451922	And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.
0.0	0.171344592909	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.89297697704	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.669782177392	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.319331278471	This ties into campaign finance reform.
0.0	0.279746927528	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.172187116531	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.460411887305	You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.
0.0	0.187922090342	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.108289529129	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.449285273355	We actually passed a living wage.
0.0	0.457525561073	And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.
0.0	0.178449817474	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.152479634759	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.136741151773	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.744585329042	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.256141005347	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.159393749193	It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.178119856544	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.
0.0	0.328223206715	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.134247387551	I win.
0.0	0.176264888342	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.177972841605	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.257704933621	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.469631761046	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.157230361223	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.298945536869	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.016294303257	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.163010910363	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.0581911446591	We were wrong.
0.0	0.234212198992	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.67514979828	I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.
0.0	0.595507737038	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.553452868733	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.0365143699918	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
1.0	0.554169195082	But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works.
1.0	0.999999870969	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.691939365243	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.0272426249225	Can we stop?
0.0	0.16470948632	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.0513464258343	We were attacked from Afghanistan.
0.0	0.191797987464	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.236579827458	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.131603557633	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.0705439941658	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.610584101888	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.231848887553	Rebuild the country's infrastructure.
0.0	0.0372602356097	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.191556362744	Say again?
0.0	0.417539266933	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.0359377701203	And he'll say, "Please, please, please."
0.0	0.342809748821	Then, in 2008, you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying that we don't need those regulations on the federal level and now you're coming back around here.
0.0	0.12045464984	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.11826564203	That's not fair.
1.0	0.0611901919709	Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.
0.0	0.243283434471	I've laid out...
0.0	0.0731691418404	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.
0.0	0.303652937756	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.245305831195	If you want to make it into the middle class -- I'm not saying in all cases -- we need plumbers, and we need carpenters, and electricians, that's for sure, and they should get help as well.
0.0	0.223724302742	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.

0.0	0.0747902588814	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.191705054084	But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be looking for new sources of energy.

0.0	0.183970402095	So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.
0.0	0.18437890277	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.0467482636731	There won't be any -- you can get it.

0.0	0.210132894108	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.
0.0	0.410627070299	So that it will not be a federal crime.

0.0	0.223278152341	I'm never going to change my tune.

0.0	0.138170900374	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.0891901667776	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.395213310367	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.

0.0	0.585773187951	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.

0.0	0.242230110275	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.163786933209	That's crony capitalism.
0.0	0.0878738164894	But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.

0.0	0.0638209698055	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.00380313671874	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.0302517245786	And guess what?
0.0	0.166886501599	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.288558816105	...John...
0.0	0.573212449201	States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government.
0.0	0.801023176133	Number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own.
0.0	0.393331233073	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.0345107626251	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.178626437068	Because now he's going a little bit better.

0.0	0.257202236611	I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible.

0.0	0.399805952787	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.
0.0	0.0924861252857	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.291494312862	But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.
1.0	0.966754075792	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.19862718713	So let's move toward what we should be doing as a nation and follow the values of our immigration history and begin to make it possible for them to come out of the shadows and to have a future that gives them a full chance of citizenship.
0.0	0.133577005811	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.304466723093	And they're wonderful people.

0.0	0.1490211989	I know every one.
0.0	0.109930298656	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.657546078626	So it is difficult.
1.0	0.902656477712	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.0929502507761	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.543609371122	The administration originally said 10.
0.0	0.125714004603	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.103023864884	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.0220997667661	See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together.
0.0	0.256845856904	I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up.
0.0	0.221269897381	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.0637039609862	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.0832389113079	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.178860179679	They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do.
0.0	0.360928928924	Sit down with people like John Mccain.
0.0	0.980656426309	Real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years.
0.0	0.202567198053	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.266601320549	And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq.
0.0	0.229479985751	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.00391260043918	I agree with them.
0.0	0.141469692519	They have no choice.
0.0	0.191637130089	...
0.0	0.28232288846	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.817297660091	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.14342774887	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.198297633113	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.3463731784	I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to -- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.
0.0	0.0429575275979	They're not good.
0.0	0.0724142577654	Yes, let's tell the truth, Martin.
0.0	0.224589365144	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.434281766129	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.213882628739	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
0.0	0.105735501496	... but wait a minute...
0.0	0.781749694346	The number of heroin deaths are growing very, very significantly.
0.0	0.250138177442	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.520198076709	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.676203399286	And so people are still going to get health care, thankfully, in emergency rooms, in hospitals.
0.0	0.0609741815974	I said, "They send it back?"
0.0	0.140833345444	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.525972934034	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.192235934494	And for good cause.

0.0	0.0770720851261	We've got nothing.
0.0	0.265341574767	Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.
0.0	0.16546417363	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.263588653215	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.183178183471	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.509593579313	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.297038945468	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.215539780337	John, the world is a very dangerous place, but the world is not too dangerous of a place for the United States of America, provided we act according to our principles, provided we act intelligently.
0.0	0.0989772396751	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.157137745442	I know the overrated ones.
0.0	0.272513766229	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.166885877843	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.386059870705	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.190550423357	But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.
0.0	0.0776145743532	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.0746994571763	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.425983997778	And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't.
0.0	0.203805317924	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.0508134850947	I do not believe in unilateral American action.
0.0	0.176248038591	I think President Obama has set a great example.

0.0	0.577284489361	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.0461017642616	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.226181126613	Your question was you have disagreed...
0.0	0.0681867998046	Please reconsider, I'll say no.
0.0	0.268675143061	Number two, this isn't me saying it.

0.0	0.889778096434	Trillions of dollars have gone from the middle class and working families to the top one-tenth of one percent who have doubled the percentage of wealth they now own.
0.0	0.301638600536	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.41946330492	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.576760647158	We have three children, eight, five and one.
0.0	0.577284489361	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.134037290983	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.157856154524	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
1.0	0.599609631705	In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.
0.0	0.281247183388	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
1.0	0.891903794915	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.368713110235	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.176291777198	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.165191281737	This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.
0.0	0.477986711068	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.0942193372543	They're a great family.
0.0	0.800367099517	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.142337954212	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.212855676546	I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history.
0.0	0.390571449957	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.0496945799579	): Secretary...
0.0	0.356941316599	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.368817727765	Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, who said my plan for what we should do to reign in Wall Street was more comprehensive and better.
0.0	0.393327153716	Every (inaudible) Democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rosa DeLauro, got ears (ph) to legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave.
0.0	0.594767786632	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.260677747601	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.221645463872	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.191637130089	That is what we have to do.
0.0	0.152847146977	We have no borders.
0.0	0.056783680509	Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down.
0.0	0.644558306653	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.199352851352	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.905632493016	To get deregulated -- listen to this, they spent $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions over a 10-year period.
0.0	0.00887965271873	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.00260022562948	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.095625253185	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.787171170297	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.191569952074	Yes.
0.0	0.166801893835	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.243419986328	One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this, is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations.
0.0	0.366902404637	Quite likely, for that reason.
0.0	0.329608514566	My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves.
0.0	0.202943387643	this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.
0.0	0.0379202956179	...the only reason is -- look...
0.0	0.489374351895	Yes, this one falls under the category of, I have actually done this.
0.0	0.0754458995942	They will be our early warning signal.
0.0	0.0578337018023	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.42641746177	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.459061605992	Again, with all do respect to Secretary Clinton...
0.0	0.101803976564	I'd suggest people take a look at it.
0.0	0.292742170454	... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.107788852702	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.103408428555	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.0727760196011	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.118007439092	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
1.0	0.411474669734	They're bringing drugs.
0.0	0.236413374512	One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy.
0.0	0.231495589361	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.17741979173	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.106758164288	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.378487418944	But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.00391260043918	I agree with that.
0.0	0.289726084663	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.114911780761	You can -- you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.
0.0	0.320117381204	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.0605180743658	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.191637130089	So did you.
0.0	0.045970857215	Sure.
0.0	0.148487935782	I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.
0.0	0.0341444295357	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.570267959039	I changed that.
0.0	0.409633736707	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.0724015903122	Thank you.
0.0	0.0317533815473	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.367851722602	Yes, exactly, exactly.
0.0	0.281002619846	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.295121764628	With all -- with all due respect...

1.0	0.5	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
1.0	0.999999399301	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.141052864055	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.227157112286	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.173366218322	I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support.
0.0	0.283143089912	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.

0.0	0.0276397786073	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.196921498748	So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe.
0.0	0.0596159982244	I believe we've got to go further.
1.0	0.999999991621	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.0772620105111	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
0.0	0.33036466017	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.260511515124	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.180772523724	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
0.0	0.560217134113	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.10834374448	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.0604630727433	There are thing that can be done.
0.0	0.691468021182	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.370567138015	So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.
0.0	0.0304864742036	...Chris...
0.0	0.342607125653	I'm not using donors.
0.0	0.369544812158	That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.
0.0	0.0606351868724	Making sure that Muslim Americans don't feel left out or marginalized at the very moment when we need their help.
0.0	0.416001855998	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
1.0	0.999996788166	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.243714707879	They come up to my office.
0.0	0.210749350865	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.330125328327	In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men.
0.0	0.24297080968	And your point is absolutely well taken.
0.0	0.101028530035	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.071594986716	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.133756250023	We are doing both at the same time.
0.0	0.321155693024	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.158333784927	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.616126972624	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.420306547567	Last point.
0.0	0.0849171160075	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.0979797866822	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.307946555805	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.161274139239	I'm proud of my family.
0.0	0.0887944119178	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.320787433369	So nice, thank you very much.
0.0	0.0616700917556	And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...
0.0	0.257181272451	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.0290531736558	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.219280348072	They are our first line of defense.
0.0	0.361534738595	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.0544514949527	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.33378836762	You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization.
0.0	0.319927443176	It's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement.
0.0	0.285002209642	Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees.
0.0	0.00520006412935	We haven't.
0.0	0.0180176330997	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.315334613942	I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground.
0.0	0.0136340430875	It's a disaster.
0.0	0.0857287039982	Find out what I said to Greenspan.
0.0	0.0701110427924	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.357381216809	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.37355721233	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.568249057197	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.307277710244	And it's impossible for our people here to compete.
0.0	0.192158469958	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.
0.0	0.0699456166614	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.563349079977	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.141469692519	They have no choice.
0.0	0.827954808314	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.188846616424	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.824937208408	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.102518127801	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.0872127231755	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.275165413007	But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.
0.0	0.507246572413	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.0809533328978	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.162600515719	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.119347261497	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
1.0	0.709566093224	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.0334107162905	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.799499272008	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
0.0	0.505262011873	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.0820472862591	I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work.
0.0	0.118411436411	You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.
0.0	0.032066786	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.933842172942	Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system.
0.0	0.253447566103	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.173300520838	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.364782118741	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.113789211885	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.573624476603	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.121006846804	The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.
0.0	0.203995785519	And I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern.
0.0	0.160479983406	Our country has tremendous potential.
0.0	0.153550761715	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.178733836567	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.62183975947	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.164946864021	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.235999286985	We have people that aren't working.
0.0	0.523779514924	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.0393713032054	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.37320328723	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.442121357577	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.238510058022	I want immigration reform to pass.
0.0	0.0315402827107	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.177900086814	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.184229053369	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.
0.0	0.0996447656008	That's fine.
0.0	0.894590636489	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.578449554533	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.338670502575	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.243553987715	... and say there is something more important than money.
1.0	0.983942465449	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
0.0	0.5	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.221526521696	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.0372602356097	But we don't know.
0.0	0.125767820984	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.086236863229	And Teddy Roosevelt is right.
0.0	0.33245297163	This is not a conflict where we send in the third divisions of Marines.
0.0	0.101689372945	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.192955034389	And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.
0.0	0.219079901471	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.089366588749	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.359438649263	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.0947804167793	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.148208950633	We know about the Brits.
1.0	0.935504922827	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.289219290138	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.7315721216	In fact, American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the National Institute of Health and that we then tested through the FDA.
0.0	0.141383517022	The Iranians getting more of a presence in Syria, linking with Hezbollah, their proxy in Lebanon, would threaten Israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with Assad's future.
0.0	0.779108014842	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.101321125504	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.17453015045	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.599838496164	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.36104225979	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.506010387183	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.0369507213101	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.157894287949	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.117203306725	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.0728346746718	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.208188562152	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.656617522931	And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.
0.0	0.208315352277	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.456626006456	to save a company.
0.0	0.166694641193	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.178762713999	Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.
0.0	0.0765176212089	Ted can change his mind.
0.0	0.229539237415	I've been to Ferguson, I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.
0.0	0.191637130089	...
0.0	0.0723543230194	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.703437034146	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
0.0	0.127149131236	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.196440823906	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.596047628991	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.17757945313	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.568544901539	I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.
0.0	0.155936735327	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.581091736971	I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment.
0.0	0.681460792376	Medicare for all, single-payer system is the way we should go.
0.0	0.275072616606	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.422610076476	And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
0.0	0.105273093207	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.168589370778	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.12032018006	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.0176406964968	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.343829935288	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
0.0	0.467695325845	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.0775076146076	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.1712558719	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.
0.0	0.540993864743	They all have jobs.
0.0	0.337172097895	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.
0.0	0.365672655482	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.399788622543	Donald Trump, for example -- I'm glad -- I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him...
0.0	0.436737296237	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.232171506687	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.160898302186	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.201968843129	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.332718147423	We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt.
0.0	0.212712771574	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.103850404916	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.250637749492	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.109402329273	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
1.0	0.999998063802	In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.
0.0	0.195783695035	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.518974147882	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.735746128049	Their business model is greed and fraud.
0.0	0.852577099889	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.124525171356	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.460644502173	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.0437288218129	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.300393238785	People came back from Iraq and Afghanistan without legs, without arms.
0.0	0.130981666163	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
0.0	0.248514507721	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.343119397863	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.823875151034	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.201761364246	Now, it's very interesting.
0.0	0.388245104733	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.318627184068	Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.
0.0	0.903712562199	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.0673470942278	So should the UK, so should France.
0.0	0.276119734459	Well, I got it for two reasons.
0.0	0.202218752803	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.347461923378	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.349156105185	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.065469468854	Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.
0.0	0.168548085066	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.
0.0	0.0771739492937	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.155958854137	Barack Obama wants to change America.
0.0	0.362666263611	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.30552503416	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.409636898755	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.535141923102	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.130320333859	The big banks--
0.0	0.961168452287	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.0867285946011	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.294452226121	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.294985645553	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.113067161987	Bret, we're just starting.
1.0	0.999998923112	Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.
0.0	0.161396661078	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.0615852657518	They know.
1.0	0.995338754025	And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.
0.0	0.0615852657518	You know why?
0.0	0.177880625214	Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle."
0.0	0.571525945919	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.123135541925	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.191637130089	That's what he is.
0.0	0.100517473519	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.588201429564	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.286440796684	When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.265019538584	It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.
0.0	0.10983379723	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.533660357036	And if they have to be in the Middle East for 20 or 30 years no problem.
0.0	0.191637130089	This is 2016.
0.0	0.551016930529	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.568725286908	And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.
0.0	0.270482723622	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.0386315156161	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.176782140573	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.257716663173	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.386244976854	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.0762763458382	I know, Bret.
0.0	0.205313686382	Parents, and sons, and daughters and family members, and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them, we must remember this, that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century.
0.0	0.0353849496655	They won't accept it.
0.0	0.159485717433	And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition.
0.0	0.706486647094	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.303064507426	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.124402082071	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.0696043089579	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.650480468972	I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone.
0.0	0.357902147085	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.338670502575	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.0124276951022	And, look, there are profound differences...
0.0	0.183310799429	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.203975874701	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.
0.0	0.362251567702	I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
0.0	0.164303379515	You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?
0.0	0.469106233048	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.580988416533	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.613183420818	To tell Qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep.
0.0	0.159795031373	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.313087740709	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.0598374763289	Marco can change his mind.
0.0	0.25838822117	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
0.0	0.121886850666	I do agree that in particular, Turkey and the Gulf nations have got to make up their minds.
0.0	0.423885575041	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.196378599757	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.360885938804	I never said that.
0.0	0.383014186571	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.315093290808	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.715717782799	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.0766377469398	We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States.
0.0	0.161571690347	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.103119530094	If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
0.0	0.422541219893	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.128751422717	We've got the consensus, what we're lacking is political leadership...
0.0	0.543758004468	And we have people that are controlled by special interests.
0.0	0.434008314651	Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
0.0	0.0887526038634	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.137939739957	The NSA is another big issue.
0.0	0.188169784623	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.0612065624727	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.133756250023	All the time.
0.0	0.082551125117	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.31908836689	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.174951515199	Not assets."
1.0	0.997233247833	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.445606890037	They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.538099644432	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.371122132427	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.25144520093	But those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort.
0.0	0.590057863096	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.300044704817	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.149082017044	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
0.0	0.184598912319	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.56651941988	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.00473214103993	Divide that out.
0.0	0.0741096907077	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.442746427523	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.197461345485	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.223995283801	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.
1.0	0.989239784904	Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.245284660809	And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.
0.0	0.314208949178	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.0864839185488	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.0818579027189	That's not the America that I think we should be.
0.0	0.78971454484	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.0187258886103	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.155705507957	He believes everything he stands for.
1.0	0.246759626612	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.160774610093	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.0855301272131	... we will secure the border...
0.0	0.288788744313	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.157609017698	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.51207615236	People have invested a lot of energy into that.
0.0	0.0549089219738	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.257434800332	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.179017131842	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.790573803216	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.234988467032	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.313616411024	The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering, these are not the perpetrators.
0.0	0.441414579798	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.122787942387	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.419728130404	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.121735665383	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.0387960017323	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
1.0	0.543888258866	But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.
0.0	0.0972968887711	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.483945278647	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.179878447476	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.225033123644	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.467348842403	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.100018347309	He was on the board.
0.0	0.5	These are often very long- term kinds of investments that have to be made.
0.0	0.0617805101405	If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.
0.0	0.247936461682	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.43572555392	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.0621097106164	So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has.
0.0	0.429426163923	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.56915178383	If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune.
0.0	0.129339779148	That's kind of a no-brainer.
0.0	0.163551889496	We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America.
0.0	0.862771065923	People have been paying it for years.
0.0	0.0452359147486	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.269145206967	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.0493881166019	I do not think it would come to that.
0.0	0.898906114882	And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion."
0.0	0.0997571589975	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.117014499711	And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.
0.0	0.155516151332	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.0976647991494	I was recruited to H.P.
1.0	0.459451782972	However, what Alan Krueger said in the piece you're referring to is that if we went to $15, there are no international comparisons.
0.0	0.076939939378	I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it.
0.0	0.158959435545	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.523210347709	I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.

0.0	0.357534641122	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.112020873636	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.159019274187	We have the U.N. Security Council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path.
0.0	0.144606833773	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.585631514429	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.278389601239	That can be done without profiling people.
0.0	0.191637130089	These...
0.0	0.206592893024	These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy, and our economic power in alignment with our principles.
1.0	0.598664253244	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.123744864918	They will not bring us -- believe me -- to the promised land.
0.0	0.294374244086	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.099068182664	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.161053218841	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.254142616956	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.0404280474593	It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino.
0.0	0.10894548011	We know about the French.
0.0	0.42396031155	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.0385947927738	OK?
0.0	0.0226435961028	I love China.
0.0	0.328592255947	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.117448215737	Who are we kidding?
0.0	0.896698414051	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.410348988268	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.
0.0	0.157236691934	I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.
0.0	0.839941847765	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.06230287968	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.277141599201	I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security.
0.0	0.244322948404	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.526325601261	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.168698087255	Ford.
0.0	0.0324895174775	I can do that.
0.0	0.162374500389	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.137911699798	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.294826111636	He's been a negative force.
0.0	0.227767342806	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.630928818529	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
1.0	0.34956663651	Well, we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists.
0.0	0.258024378854	Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.
0.0	0.253742257486	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.335851882822	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.452828118187	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.0952819601063	And Martha...
0.0	0.152601491124	It's great to be at Trump Tower.
0.0	0.884576453057	I sell apartments for -- I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.
0.0	0.18554814828	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.125732897823	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.177048744248	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.208924772743	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.139601675018	We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.
0.0	0.171781653407	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.181820349835	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.
0.0	0.278970484885	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.0563064052182	Now the Libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge ISIS from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.
0.0	0.185143756384	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.
0.0	0.0180781396961	I think what is...
0.0	0.295121764628	In all due respect...
0.0	0.115911085334	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
0.0	0.917860659815	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...
0.0	0.313945495514	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
0.0	0.247309173903	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.00790241594085	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.880606790024	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.182532562436	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.303699127884	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.533665171387	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.307092073393	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
1.0	0.197232442992	A lot of people up there can't get jobs.
0.0	0.0979205136532	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.62393812559	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.230829827323	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.166957809764	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
0.0	0.404077575432	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.41590642516	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.305593248643	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.0667656737816	Yeah.
0.0	0.469320417126	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.421117583559	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.0724015903122	Thank you.
0.0	0.208161338381	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.119214606142	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.451029962648	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
0.0	0.303404848483	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
1.0	0.999989488156	Very few children.
0.0	0.0173165986829	And I hear their speeches.
0.0	0.0590338911038	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.050084680216	Right?
0.0	0.352071730885	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
1.0	0.951039550675	He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.
0.0	0.235684615263	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.154903318219	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.348896433005	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
0.0	0.208941711386	But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.
0.0	0.126626030551	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.114971321798	Oh, great.
0.0	0.66138473612	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.0840524190497	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.0681592841259	Let me say on that...
1.0	0.975900157729	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.262445006587	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.680728078625	For example, it is outrageous that we don't have an opportunity for Medicare to negotiate for lower prices.
0.0	0.883191255857	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.399139180933	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.339579163477	No, I've never made a promise like that.
0.0	0.106856497173	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.398874976639	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.637632663041	I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
0.0	0.404519851378	End -- end Common Core.
0.0	0.34373399624	I say, "That's a terrible story.
0.0	0.154716642172	So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.
1.0	0.362082527068	He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage, and what its effects are.
0.0	0.0202950115487	That's off the table...
0.0	0.178557340764	Now, what does that mean?
0.0	0.526827820273	There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.
0.0	0.213822146923	I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.206359953954	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.0835199664371	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.351174157047	But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything.
0.0	0.240210887563	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.159515968934	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.689171136718	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.258610837467	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.685585533236	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.368469927175	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.0321902198142	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.0360284515457	I beat China all the time.
0.0	0.476287328758	It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.
0.0	0.208774098492	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.302243448665	But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.202132377613	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.436960074181	First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, "they cannot have it all."
0.0	0.450862705359	Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.
0.0	0.0302288612286	And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen.
0.0	0.162496833581	... and I encourage everybody watching this tonight to please, acknowledge that by going online at martinomalley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism.
0.0	0.374916820745	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.165640778981	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.37814201702	And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina, and many other Republican states, that because of their right wing political ideology, are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.655816787812	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.0361491464363	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.121685504123	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.0822351031949	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.797509658967	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.0198901897532	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.330850808148	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.450936080267	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.
0.0	0.273581965894	And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.
0.0	0.0573773073145	So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.
0.0	0.088888951439	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.0396160039239	But look, we didn't know what was happening next.
0.0	0.585023430473	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.198687900109	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.264152045111	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.0868942976409	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.27099700384	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.211508304256	That means everything.
0.0	0.108115197024	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.150926708052	And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth.
0.0	0.0614639789243	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.213182937299	The people don't work for us.
0.0	0.67816588456	But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance.
0.0	0.292490511532	And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before.
0.0	0.368220947131	This is revolutionary for education in America.
1.0	0.556220244815	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
1.0	0.563933977339	Today, we have 272.
0.0	0.219040532277	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.224870546697	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.115578494071	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.142056086284	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.197659204659	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.56795633767	We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.520286221175	I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department.
0.0	0.237321165034	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
0.0	0.427579965714	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.135033588018	And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a -- that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.
0.0	0.00914145721572	Look what they did in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.0898297373649	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.461881592413	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.
0.0	0.680749734473	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.374811119725	I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor, I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very, very powerful and most important of all jobs in the United States, the president, whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country.
0.0	0.200317626834	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.191637130089	No.
0.0	0.265339244558	How the hell can you vote for this guy?
0.0	0.887523929117	Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts.
0.0	0.103408428555	Let me just say this...
0.0	0.109906096968	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.571586318301	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0180781396961	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.0372443666266	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.430653506445	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.0902436610851	I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...
0.0	0.524344575068	The world has changed.
0.0	0.149630745016	But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate.
0.0	0.0180781396961	They think they are.
0.0	0.198747740587	And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives.
1.0	0.699405991284	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
1.0	0.181145400413	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.452027652428	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.277938275035	We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.
0.0	0.24100567163	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.103702794333	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.0285410318967	You're welcome.
1.0	0.995330687629	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.0539105809994	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.0996988099655	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.511609871192	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.391877730692	Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.
0.0	0.0581911446591	He's wrong.
0.0	0.194621352985	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.268112801907	No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.
0.0	0.422420398783	And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.
0.0	0.0574673249782	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.247400563867	I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out.
0.0	0.269651596718	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.104903721682	And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.
0.0	0.539815236893	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.693573717909	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.10130933112	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
0.0	0.607944774662	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.445295944298	All of us want equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.249826190273	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.161062464523	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
0.0	0.153086444476	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.0601738912973	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.407201577288	I have a comprehensive, tough plan.
0.0	0.386495983054	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.626909869162	Number one...
0.0	0.270113525268	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.556770674589	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.267019108191	Like, I'm standing here, I -- I watched the video of Senator Cruz.
0.0	0.207006366585	Chris I was mentioned in that question.
0.0	0.0289718641162	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.505556724141	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.443883836072	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.0929972738937	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.337966665108	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.045970857215	He sure did.
0.0	0.0682488906729	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.127045347105	My background is different.
0.0	0.651045844426	We've enacted it in our state.
0.0	0.304273240329	We can triple the border patrol.
0.0	0.203098002283	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
0.0	0.5	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.0268838273638	That's what our parents and grandparents always did.
1.0	0.999997289007	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.
0.0	0.0146153643949	We are rebuilding China.
0.0	0.298548092747	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.132433093212	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.275138889619	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.76332105489	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.106358029225	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.331822305578	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.00917514462771	I am against the raids.
1.0	0.116592972601	We owe Japan more than that.
0.0	0.0961014058339	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.412893436023	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.254531651555	And I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate.
0.0	0.130800735846	But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything -- everything, they got away with it again.
0.0	0.572739006117	It's their money.
0.0	0.277661951515	Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region.
0.0	0.059512264778	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.374267561064	And I think that's the false choice...
0.0	0.467828218856	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.235268588008	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.196645675044	And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.
0.0	0.154774499134	She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.
0.0	0.176106832465	I said no.
0.0	0.198263280594	We need money.
0.0	0.149462127964	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.762802605368	That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.
0.0	0.687069542459	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.727985891623	Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.
0.0	0.0791500216847	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.141445035363	This nation is the most powerful military in the world.
0.0	0.463875503873	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.0465355773597	Great.
0.0	0.340902693254	Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons.
0.0	0.0857444695666	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
1.0	0.863034677431	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.457939576179	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.108639479473	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.51262421948	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.148893567813	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.432853914032	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
1.0	0.894416783222	They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
0.0	0.141105416333	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.0743662817449	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.23297483573	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.241029012544	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
1.0	0.999998844187	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.285662424523	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.0684553011915	He's an entertaining guy.
0.0	0.191637130089	No.
0.0	0.0106744647219	They will not.
0.0	0.471335267749	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.397709071944	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.051459953405	I need your help.
0.0	0.348804833129	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.490849925415	Clearly the best piece of veterans' legislation brought forth in decades.
0.0	0.471079744114	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.250859141976	It was terrible.
1.0	0.999999034056	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.311488515475	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.0313153532222	Both served.
0.0	0.5	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.162687251814	If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're (inaudible).
0.0	0.0580633652353	He was a little teddy bear to me.
0.0	0.382898809413	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.284118529161	I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not.
0.0	0.238087101693	I said, "What's your problem?"
0.0	0.125789879362	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.148280217727	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.0487082837732	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.160968821279	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.232950616905	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.0311858436703	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.286518737307	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.
0.0	0.0217927013321	Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth.
0.0	0.161850911753	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.153156578635	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.364565193075	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.748067283934	... and 85 percent of gun owners agree.
0.0	0.421772573454	That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities.
0.0	0.014955552671	That's my view.
0.0	0.154911548065	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.262147478035	There are hundreds of things like that.
0.0	0.659217167956	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.252286966109	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.224172822848	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
1.0	0.0890215613082	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.176058831057	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.0561543086198	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.0680203893381	But let's be clear.
0.0	0.430506053387	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.398772603957	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.133593714405	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.255708834826	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.0705509112229	I heard what they said.
0.0	0.126767384689	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.344387621757	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.435820930801	Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.160707054965	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.487128921466	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
0.0	0.148089160638	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.123493082288	And I believe he is absolutely right.
0.0	0.148197346676	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.227951987781	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.169066144576	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.0553391253204	I love the Saudis.
0.0	0.152262927633	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
1.0	0.991644057868	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.0621823842212	I think we're missing the point here.
0.0	0.308222192117	You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
0.0	0.181661758918	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.414782518894	I do respect Rand.
0.0	0.131689770512	There will be a process.
0.0	0.302057741246	Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.
0.0	0.44314565026	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
0.0	0.180493952599	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.576160803509	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.0834127281139	We've got to hate the Muslims."
0.0	0.0914059721874	They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
0.0	0.681476807697	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.0355433558772	This is the election...
0.0	0.178384862278	You have to lead.
0.0	0.348847798373	So, I thank you very much for that.
0.0	0.10323952863	It never happens.
0.0	0.408080485486	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.00897097010959	You looking at me?
0.0	0.633908436793	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
0.0	0.132045949192	I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.
0.0	0.343289845584	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.190603197756	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.192596546291	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.235451694705	We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
0.0	0.0524983407474	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.0913745840884	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.00189413293851	How would we act?
0.0	0.645693946095	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.640653820418	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.798215372192	There was a minimum wage at the state level, and some places went higher.
0.0	0.242959699701	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.411539577923	And, yes, we are at war with those people.
1.0	0.863783307859	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.268121079307	You've got to go the extra mile.
0.0	0.101942157553	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
0.0	0.318748909136	The Obama administration.
0.0	0.198321790944	And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.
0.0	0.5	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.133580324909	Let's be frank here.
0.0	0.0724724986108	The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.
0.0	0.0166110903806	So they put together this.
0.0	0.622679957347	We have people that are morally corrupt.
0.0	0.30780787403	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.316894877602	They've advertised that.
0.0	0.678940303269	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.221948125928	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.0615183968167	That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.
0.0	0.623894671324	But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks.
0.0	0.108173021681	They can provide resources.
0.0	0.130720731535	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.220140334915	So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
0.0	0.182770129529	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.142037797048	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.0463929740554	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.0945166317334	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.116284083416	Megyn, that's the problem.
0.0	0.200442704924	But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you.
0.0	0.0553391253204	No, I love them.
0.0	0.380616945753	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.178923331442	You're seeing cities like San Francisco, cities like Los Angeles doing it, and they are doing it well and workers are able to have more disposable income.
0.0	0.0567189831017	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.165946683237	I love this country.
0.0	0.300025182292	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.813901969939	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.463986141011	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.0208558731847	I don't want it.
0.0	0.0575261290457	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.0601917760485	Let's have a Democratic Syria.
0.0	0.125845057009	I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen.
0.0	0.5	Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.
0.0	0.769597107714	And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.
0.0	0.0751776509082	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.0462932343043	I think there is a consensus.
0.0	0.126935180629	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.305952637856	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.074045554635	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.0962806850102	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.0689219119148	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
0.0	0.164735766981	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.
0.0	0.191637130089	But what...
0.0	0.152910595173	I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis.
0.0	0.368010357121	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.565361064656	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
1.0	0.992171985469	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
1.0	0.993075068583	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.0394825822574	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.167132308268	The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.
0.0	0.302622191685	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.318605769891	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.
0.0	0.447629759827	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.285437066809	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.199758014061	We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground."
0.0	0.458202284876	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.0778170522932	We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels.
0.0	0.537077513404	It's affordable for everybody.
0.0	0.205338796894	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.440415453957	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.00698406082944	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.0674052879835	And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.
0.0	0.554133301385	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.329609651793	So the fact is that we work for the people.
0.0	0.438707844573	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.215104519314	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.0588813295448	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.141523302025	I know the bad ones.
0.0	0.295760459299	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.263080226246	It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York.
0.0	0.0251675599333	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.453816846886	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.0990017689471	You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying.
0.0	0.255781891981	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.633598801142	We ended up with 56 votes.
0.0	0.433442044729	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.384630139439	Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.
0.0	0.050084680216	That is not right.
0.0	0.18687114817	Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top.
0.0	0.0434072832946	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.213651307738	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
0.0	0.163623163774	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.0703877892844	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.105346794739	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.0180781396961	Think about that.
0.0	0.107482134929	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.
0.0	0.378635705223	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.460073090934	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.352177177281	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.284304375743	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.5478463111	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.882823990958	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.0125181531026	And I watch the speeches.
0.0	0.272201426972	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.
0.0	0.224641993209	I'll advertise my Web site as well.
0.0	0.254466505007	Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people.
0.0	0.0827436923814	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.380060759719	You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?
0.0	0.226672903985	But actually I am.
0.0	0.109941735956	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.00647898490005	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.585450476412	I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of State, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now.
0.0	0.0967206168086	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.199130396745	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
0.0	0.539361125955	You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks.
0.0	0.120682913471	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.0344182910396	They'll all come back.
0.0	0.344736386752	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.295911123931	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
0.0	0.310852941145	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.584500928897	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.165884014026	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.52481477758	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.450108760493	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.399022462257	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.196654402741	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.27185644076	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.
0.0	0.395340197764	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.573624980912	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
1.0	0.833970048125	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.664717139156	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.0863718164229	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
0.0	0.215136056867	This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.
0.0	0.414946481478	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.166050828448	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.094143122237	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.0968296724187	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.0373400495419	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.282880198731	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.473828097547	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.710450165681	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.088593015589	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.120822220832	It's called the politics.
1.0	0.996091338237	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.147535236381	I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries.
0.0	0.689869624961	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.185043964012	Man (ph), their mother's here as well.
0.0	0.239003917884	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.221053659465	Does anyone know this?"
0.0	0.180508356454	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
0.0	0.0686750051313	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.540679918486	And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.
0.0	0.923103889467	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.450580651342	It's become more complicated.
0.0	0.670366586504	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.0686552581229	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.208940025551	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.298402432002	We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.
0.0	0.239576448396	And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process.
0.0	0.369167946034	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0670300435776	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.180906321658	Those are all really positive developments.
0.0	0.492308496709	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.0637213093383	It is a tragedy all over this country.
0.0	0.995430516194	Do the $12 and you would index it.
0.0	0.178127284325	Absolutely.
0.0	0.213971856549	So I would say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.333577366291	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.
0.0	0.0293877981954	We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets.
0.0	0.421895914341	It was the most highly sought after -- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
0.0	0.180237158663	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.0252688796484	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.536092930252	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.244136239057	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.117392201711	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
0.0	0.132440363603	It's coming from more than Mexico.
0.0	0.510686187698	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.126427985132	If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country.
0.0	0.15665415071	We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
0.0	0.826891305323	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.302484874875	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.361189582774	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.715412412302	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.258464550661	Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values.
0.0	0.5	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
0.0	0.0956697877799	And it's-- it's a worthy debate.
0.0	0.343598123146	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.0973399637296	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.250492723101	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.417225066629	If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship.
0.0	0.975910556639	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.555167772734	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.17341027726	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.206519943093	Check it out.
0.0	0.0726564733645	We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game.
0.0	0.191637130089	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.159325356368	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.215399946775	And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.
0.0	0.355980265443	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.477838253201	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.432995109162	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.0822314533617	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.127319879998	But, I would also add this.
1.0	0.8092740093	That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.
0.0	0.0618304879093	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.0659248940425	I think any parent would be so proud of them.
0.0	0.356734060647	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.612711160792	And universities.
0.0	0.342954970515	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.883613103568	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.112240813589	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.0975074658916	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.126197335527	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.226935678341	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.122524261874	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.0871078114205	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
1.0	0.999999251169	Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education.
0.0	0.798367595952	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.449189967873	We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.
0.0	0.112168365763	I like them.
0.0	0.0619011992701	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.0656403872714	We need -- we need somebody -- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.
0.0	0.251980836392	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.0635157777924	We will make America great again.
1.0	0.997047690097	Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world.
0.0	0.114763563765	I would change them.
0.0	0.165332653564	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.0615852657518	And you know what?
0.0	0.195346393501	That is abundantly clear.
0.0	0.5	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.178127284325	Absolutely.
0.0	0.208544083158	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.215405110736	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.275530251329	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.0465355773597	How great is that?
0.0	0.580561624295	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.302954651093	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.73232295363	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.443853531781	She has devoted her life, when I was mayor of the city of Burlington, actually when I first met her, we started a youth office, which started a after-school programs for kids, started a child care center, started a youth newspaper.
1.0	0.895631014384	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.754331786912	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.
0.0	0.207481118581	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.103397587255	The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.
0.0	0.191569952074	Yes.
0.0	0.271979017755	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
1.0	0.512994098566	According to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.050084680216	That's right.
0.0	0.0599126634409	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.0757728012112	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.0289718641162	Believe me.
0.0	0.305244749455	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.158181872308	Yes, they control them.
0.0	0.155011877689	When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal?
0.0	0.339864588868	Against the Republican leadership, who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies.
0.0	0.358571630779	Thank you, John.
0.0	0.0527380099342	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.228932775364	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.266178979672	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.0557572526246	And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.
0.0	0.781215518362	I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.
0.0	0.22424675104	I have a wonderful family.
0.0	0.448749939231	And for my part, I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has.
0.0	0.0927656466134	It -- it doesn't need to be that way.
0.0	0.0795395098943	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.302269505506	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.507085330707	Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes.
0.0	0.113125710435	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.204615922684	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.182283476516	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
0.0	0.184779990749	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.292358062715	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.0620452506443	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.0991408338414	You have a problem with ISIS.
0.0	0.182225868548	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.222088819285	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.248441458235	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
0.0	0.119818716291	He undermines it.
0.0	0.172740359668	And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.
0.0	0.255591651194	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.116399818367	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.27186635824	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.470400835727	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.541882756927	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.474986781535	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.643151945229	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.747219275194	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.
0.0	0.152957005379	And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
0.0	0.20989816219	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.970503324419	...income tax...
1.0	0.925566366594	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.198547421968	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.0678932824314	But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.162414844754	So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.
0.0	0.141162064739	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
0.0	0.0614096734504	I'm an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I miss doing eye surgery, still get to do a little bit.
0.0	0.375164247147	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
0.0	0.235292801713	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.0924485364477	And we're talking about fantasy football?
1.0	0.918193732521	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.924150377645	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.0724015903122	Thank you.
0.0	0.13886176761	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.389875663009	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.196025258859	Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen?
0.0	0.0303754031745	They're Muslim.
1.0	0.986616768544	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.050084680216	Right.
0.0	0.176515397698	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.
0.0	0.4360804632	So as a nation we need to increase what we invest in Pell grants.
0.0	0.243922706613	I don't know and with all due respect to the secretary, Wall Street played by the rules?
0.0	0.211680615922	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.13754852801	They will never make America great again.
0.0	0.294479596376	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.0759025298084	You want to know what carpet bombing is?
0.0	0.018217242877	DICKERSON: A question from Kathie Obradovich.
0.0	0.0724015903122	...Thank you.
0.0	0.331788802758	Two weeks later, the place was blown up.
0.0	0.832386487906	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.752565892153	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.193006640738	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
1.0	0.989797230465	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.250307878865	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.643220793109	In fact, if you remember, 50, 60 years ago, the University of California, City University of New York were virtually tuition-free.
0.0	0.126829680797	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.156843245021	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.019184937288	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.248443184127	Terrorism in this country scares everyone.
0.0	0.547599586285	It wasn't the bill that I wanted, but yet it turned out to be one of the more significant pieces of veterans' legislation passed in recent history.
0.0	0.305027838287	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.112397332361	He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments.
0.0	0.42029536391	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.00520006412935	No, they shouldn't.
0.0	0.0619054228247	But he wasn't a cheerleader.
0.0	0.0724015903122	Thank you.
0.0	0.261436053315	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.0615852657518	You know why?
0.0	0.0996776819347	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.0280325816847	It's not working.
0.0	0.457309150321	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.0158906356354	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.233612285833	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.337966665108	And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said.
0.0	0.751006411622	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
1.0	0.174785669724	We passed it after 9/11.
0.0	0.100483241124	And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president.
0.0	0.506749032944	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.296241499792	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.0668814681794	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.0586208435665	Break them up.
0.0	0.190977537485	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.0265473989014	You just can't do it.
0.0	0.13786523769	That's because we've put conservative policies in place.
0.0	0.115094763248	Mark my words.
0.0	0.0164578213669	We're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.0333464319782	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.09003502477	And he is a proud American Muslim.
0.0	0.244038133106	I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.
0.0	0.0983610362923	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.323599121818	And in 19 -- and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said -- and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever.
0.0	0.191637130089	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.241123751782	I've dealt with them all my life.
0.0	0.240602019741	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.46969728512	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.275631629759	So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.
0.0	0.528674810648	We can end welfare for those here illegally.
1.0	0.29745914955	We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
0.0	0.612522159895	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.436481292146	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.889157775113	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.0761628502836	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.36092940338	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.123481981011	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.210679010827	Many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed.
0.0	0.423585741061	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.316156177035	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.395051583897	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.420027084024	I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons.
0.0	0.212130681615	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.191150011503	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.147680564517	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.28066623595	I do not support amnesty...
0.0	0.0827614837495	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.0268066271039	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.488410442471	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.114848203417	I kind of miss Donald Trump.
0.0	0.316892640373	When somebody is addicted and seeking help, they should not have to wait three, four months in order to get that help.

0.0	0.0385947927738	OK.

0.0	0.322285266398	What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years.
0.0	0.379864135481	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.

0.0	0.279246359665	But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.
0.0	0.541013291466	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.163786933209	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.216385214481	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.182298424655	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.242763661893	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.291289596593	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
1.0	0.999999736297	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.
0.0	0.104730294576	The answer is no.
0.0	0.364196612067	ISIS, now, is the major priority.
0.0	0.302886060867	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.236782448087	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.0694925738583	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.407669704677	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.196609609003	If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences.
0.0	0.111750358662	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.160533023595	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.
0.0	0.235144556401	We only have one or two.
0.0	0.0866400358612	Look, here is the reality, folks.
1.0	0.32080703057	Twenty-one mass shootings, including one last weekend in Des Moins where three were murdered.
0.0	0.07941934362	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.0724015903122	Thank you.
0.0	0.349282574132	It's one of the key investments we need to make.
0.0	0.191637130089	...
0.0	0.849076689696	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.0295769350385	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.232184522778	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.310289260274	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.104554821271	I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.
0.0	0.612802916612	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.142661903314	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.254625635055	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.0351340641121	But we came together.
0.0	0.161167156935	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.5	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.164988726514	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.217366501798	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.0969857776749	Because I've seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime.
0.0	0.152848187272	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.182883965114	Okay, thank you.
0.0	0.188059651423	I really am.
0.0	0.254638851293	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.
0.0	0.488468623531	Well, we're going to have to redo the way the prescription drug industry does business.
0.0	0.0356206847285	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.135879250593	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.186961311042	And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
0.0	0.0588232790507	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.280046436893	But I said, "Don't hit Iraq," because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East.
0.0	0.162189246982	Wall Street today has too much political power.
0.0	0.273470506383	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.0330806333903	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.207164368842	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.
0.0	0.473955556541	I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here.
0.0	0.280456860307	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.967144476592	So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion.
0.0	0.692480427278	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.427771993534	Never support.
0.0	0.318110014183	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.131453577454	It sounds crass.
0.0	0.5	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.164644219787	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.151019794962	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.197068380844	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.193479772454	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.345132933253	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.0521742333277	He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, "No interest."
0.0	0.237288444928	I would just say that...
0.0	0.197545648125	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.15160289169	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.317689293842	He is a good man.
0.0	0.0849455224288	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.0894763490169	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.24688154935	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.923013163264	You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56 percent, equivalent to 56 percent of the GDP In America.
1.0	0.975371827378	Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.
0.0	0.0996603910611	You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.
0.0	0.175319826609	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.0973901690939	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.128807461135	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.281923198516	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.0329431036882	Let's...
0.0	0.147962873335	He said, "You know, I make great product."
0.0	0.359430773051	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
1.0	0.896943023529	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.603119269273	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.388175884036	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.88452902161	So it's unfair to say in total...
0.0	0.199750648739	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.154987770241	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.473791952655	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.218541899521	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.259970249804	I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
0.0	0.117624762289	I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.
0.0	0.0694411288824	But we stuck to our message.
1.0	0.576326901645	And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
0.0	0.239362417194	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.741349744178	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.382115249555	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.967047854322	Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.
0.0	0.148030527739	I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.460777325888	It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.
0.0	0.160749335587	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.988202182562	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.128900152941	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.533227380526	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.556116322277	Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force.
0.0	0.18906122069	They have children who are doing so well, I've met and worked with dreamers.
0.0	0.244065420858	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
1.0	0.938961290957	And I have assets -- big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected -- 9 billion 240 million dollars.
0.0	0.108359648737	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.182768880466	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.202986549219	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.748658996092	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.125985939365	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.290734987217	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.
0.0	0.170463892957	People aren't dumb.
1.0	0.372799344514	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.421222285522	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.444813353394	Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability.
0.0	0.0615852657518	So you know what?
0.0	0.193100174327	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.587988068819	She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.309469738219	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.562112344253	That's true.
0.0	0.471358552501	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.838977159403	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.451897232947	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.115434225806	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.0488140365562	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.314743973744	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.319764942073	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.239064078162	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.456525909721	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.235773825089	They sweated like dogs.
0.0	0.320465170354	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.169742597084	We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be -- we ought to send our surplus.
0.0	0.0507004857281	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.186742401994	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.0613351573489	As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe.
0.0	0.777377047634	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.112168365763	I like them.
0.0	0.304248341745	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
0.0	0.100512662316	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.153630173857	We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
0.0	0.162233974296	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.209303217942	But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."
0.0	0.0984299403925	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.142730615631	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.73232295363	And I opposed it.
0.0	0.270525782439	We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy.
0.0	0.426645024843	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.0388981849991	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.0817215580084	John, I think somewhere between...
0.0	0.213573435413	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.505031439504	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.314361483416	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.0496093260215	It is ISIS.
0.0	0.123490070631	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.234760431402	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
1.0	0.868495782201	And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent.
0.0	0.116909097871	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.192160604662	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.0712883396519	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.0801452346247	We're running.
0.0	0.131803584368	Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
0.0	0.583937092241	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.133448848827	But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country.
1.0	0.999999942433	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.110407705062	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.21737066997	Folks, it's not too late.
0.0	0.615792664046	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.0726527139928	Let me just...
1.0	0.798057780622	We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.185681124973	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.527111983233	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.191637130089	That has not been...
0.0	0.344072878346	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.480747913424	And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details.
0.0	0.5	We were the first in the family.
0.0	0.337678719032	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.
0.0	0.179437622013	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.389813167926	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.35186833611	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.600227955195	In the last 30 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth.
0.0	0.416457234783	My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, which sparked my interest in the need for immigration reform because I know what it's like to be the son of an immigrant.

0.0	0.264620211393	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.427086444447	Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago.
0.0	0.247698342976	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.0324895174775	We can do that.
0.0	0.144150288968	All of you in Iowa, I need you to caucus for me.

0.0	0.292563619194	Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone.
0.0	0.170139172243	You've got to be on top of it.
0.0	0.191637130089	But Megyn...

0.0	0.704702149217	And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.171695727932	I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House.
0.0	0.177858086494	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.180046671866	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.127369533926	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.0724015903122	Thank you.
0.0	0.379899577926	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.361004190846	We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it.
0.0	0.0451503622445	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.

0.0	0.113686172396	Let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.0515939943064	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.763418372181	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.0958057703593	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.00828266138669	But I was born here.
0.0	0.343706128389	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.328842029387	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.13895248727	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.163843100498	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.24574460404	The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
0.0	0.0803337353184	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.0426117993381	I know how hard it is to build coalitions.
0.0	0.577095271217	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.203992696182	A military island.
0.0	0.161018480193	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.701248527384	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.104625708132	But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand.
0.0	0.322084198594	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.257269752715	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.

0.0	0.138889469006	They wouldn't be there except for us.
0.0	0.29303306154	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.764016243205	But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
0.0	0.179688588127	They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.
0.0	0.193936932667	But he used to say, "Donald, don't go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.170594801157	But the facts are simple.
0.0	0.216051478924	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.198585980668	A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.
0.0	0.0125368508375	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.0110025586873	That is the issue.
0.0	0.770679951507	Why is it that we are spending per capita far, far more than Canada, which is 100 miles away from my door, that guarantees health care to all people?
0.0	0.5	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.640182554665	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.201314834157	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.650519635453	It is enormously complicated.
0.0	0.125099915019	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.195047673526	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.580141778224	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.191637130089	No, you did.
0.0	0.225499166781	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0307910448031	That is an egregious act.

0.0	0.0113402350592	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.136644504981	It really is important that we go forward on this.
0.0	0.0677782855701	They can't lead us.
0.0	0.888106585757	No criminal records for them.

0.0	0.180480650962	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.232682630086	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.464029097935	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.357593661225	And now many of these candidates want to cut it.
0.0	0.104044462604	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.313318746789	When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
0.0	0.33335517464	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.

0.0	0.52482043016	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.357969445896	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
1.0	0.955088150421	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
0.0	0.647715862125	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.329481231182	And we have to stop all the divisions.

1.0	0.470191034619	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.26588763609	I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.
0.0	0.116573423206	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.0324895174775	You can do both.
0.0	0.335133686433	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.

0.0	0.38125353505	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.158062569147	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.187408382426	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.693729143957	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.247727004059	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.119034843357	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.

0.0	0.562112344253	It's true.

0.0	0.553247182105	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.221568541166	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.935712278489	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.140859298538	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.

0.0	0.0274085478449	We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.
0.0	0.430914673363	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.192438236127	And I will go back and say again, AIG was not a big bank.
0.0	0.0596602466219	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.0817329688898	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.178127284325	Absolutely.
0.0	0.937400734981	We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.
0.0	0.445405469559	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.152887607597	I'm going to support you, and I think that is absolutely appropriate.
0.0	0.232363962671	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.
0.0	0.941435327418	I'm one of the 77 percent.
0.0	0.291086589578	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.100625906213	I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran.
0.0	0.06939171253	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.418538387745	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.115782001744	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
0.0	0.176449349981	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.169118101014	I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.
0.0	0.294202283349	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.183163049123	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.164285178164	We need sound money.
0.0	0.458362147902	But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.
0.0	0.127518328104	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.17782735456	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.

0.0	0.11694103933	She never lived to see that.
0.0	0.564584071566	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.320995156835	If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W. Bush made after 9/11 when he basically said after going to a Mosque in Washington, we are not at war with Islam or Muslims.
1.0	0.976579952288	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.299847883141	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.262797238702	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.409853880614	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.102011133104	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.52409838292	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.172030147833	I think that what we're facing with ISIS is especially complicated.
0.0	0.643576622766	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.122069370439	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
0.0	0.374228461836	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.
1.0	0.0739344366452	It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.41111683116	But we can give people better health care.

0.0	0.179032252023	They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.
0.0	0.140667800657	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.186175565124	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.408968484134	We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.
0.0	0.419914396702	This is what's made our nation so special.
0.0	0.182704523767	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.882297884081	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.485606707995	That's what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I'm proud that they're supporting my campaign.
0.0	0.434653886156	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.145522746412	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.645822598718	And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.0776943263927	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.193619435969	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.
0.0	0.586063784078	Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.
0.0	0.217890445887	Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.
0.0	0.049693747862	Here's the story.
0.0	0.229927886371	And, you know, I do think it's important to do exactly what Senator Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about, and that they talk to each of us about.
0.0	0.111351371263	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.264311843008	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
1.0	0.996503526162	But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.
0.0	0.269570552838	Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.
0.0	0.160332445229	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.362338017216	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.0508238818429	He's very smooth.
0.0	0.141248019608	It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.
0.0	0.140276877135	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?

0.0	0.387789266991	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.314335030419	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.185584343856	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.212462350203	All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee.
0.0	0.481134870863	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.10773627211	Our next president...
0.0	0.186219826342	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.54934318779	And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity.
0.0	0.402308297058	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.511533635054	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.112744386764	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.254950787657	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.645593574518	In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, "what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"
0.0	0.147991761275	And here's what the economic issue is.
1.0	0.935309331956	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.524450092431	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.226672903985	We actually did it.
0.0	0.418005837	It certainly does cover it.
1.0	0.98235782333	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.34121745524	Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.
0.0	0.042801459916	Because it wouldn't work.
1.0	0.988644915024	ISIL videos, ISIL training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in America is at a gun show.
0.0	0.0724015903122	Thank you.
0.0	0.245560022813	It's real estate.
0.0	0.267569784082	Given the fact that she's a lot smarter than me, yes, she would.
0.0	0.276526891556	And it's an honor to have everybody here.
0.0	0.411529607106	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.646596514603	But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
0.0	0.223225582385	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
1.0	0.848444564353	People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.
0.0	0.40812616344	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.0217451176482	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.105043241512	You don't hear it from anybody else.
0.0	0.0516213964496	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.367501114406	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.276704199082	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.133064236801	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.636827326407	Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers.
0.0	0.619464448642	They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?
0.0	0.126588508725	And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.
0.0	0.251902771336	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.244793645492	My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.
0.0	0.659978077499	One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines.
0.0	0.0489221242435	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.134179454655	And so do I.
0.0	0.0150457814003	You get together.
0.0	0.160780919146	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.312006182562	It was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up.
0.0	0.379017693621	You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon.
0.0	0.428874655251	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.334228496367	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.219509147248	I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war.
0.0	0.117633303987	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.0666298070069	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.00223460765799	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.101912427862	We need much more than that.
0.0	0.302071158303	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.176978827563	Go ahead.
0.0	0.0370875424656	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.0286760933482	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.0932323635369	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.848519986226	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.0180781396961	Think about it.
0.0	0.319736150776	And in that capacity, I met with just an extraordinary group of people from World War II, from korea, vietnam, all of the wars.
0.0	0.694638990878	People died, and only three people have been fired.
0.0	0.306026704506	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.116321439269	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.261500478098	Here's my promise-- Wall Street representatives will not be in my cabinet.
0.0	0.61926143141	The business model of Wall Street is fraud.
0.0	0.189025380826	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.211456616274	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.103689974036	Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.
0.0	0.444794603974	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.164101516896	Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title.
0.0	0.121953175422	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.
0.0	0.132224359032	How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
0.0	0.494146365863	They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.0577345677145	We say "we're gonna protect."
0.0	0.276985512118	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.208471660886	And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.
0.0	0.180551645774	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.632644191628	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.528224651429	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.0176357723234	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.0461782455634	I gotta do it, Dad.
0.0	0.041378156851	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
0.0	0.839149033261	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.00587684124577	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.19796318503	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.569963508536	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.545350569338	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.199600108064	He said, "Yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.0844235880312	Now they're going militarily.
0.0	0.0691829608568	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.513750670992	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.00112418449701	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.252286399452	We shouldn't have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time.
0.0	0.314002475774	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.194271005205	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.
0.0	0.905596656215	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.361366315606	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.

1.0	0.99126681508	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.240756499682	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.

0.0	0.21089131202	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.283510520784	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.

0.0	0.0797970302818	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.30098860985	What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria, when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family you'd better get out now.
0.0	0.447956629957	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.

0.0	0.0932776799221	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.

0.0	0.683609097234	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.550821025759	As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country.
0.0	0.155969919117	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.0914973385709	They beat us all the time.
0.0	0.3131337402	We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.
0.0	0.423813697444	And so, you go the extra mile.
0.0	0.144019778934	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.202600286627	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.306544980921	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.193792325486	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.443153488339	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.389236138411	Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.
0.0	0.138756464772	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.132675717195	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.
0.0	0.448654314897	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.0686750051313	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.134334073238	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.183599426866	My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.
0.0	0.253965245743	China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it.

0.0	0.299154702694	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.

0.0	0.0899091331185	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
0.0	0.106701873251	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.106160616963	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.179127726984	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.121577803883	You know, this is not easy work.
0.0	0.222330603704	I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.
0.0	0.523645082562	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.15397717373	But people have to be alert.
0.0	0.788090173559	That's what I said to my own public health people.
0.0	0.0381688620441	We have -- I don't know that there's any disagreement here...
0.0	0.452094526071	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.332390172619	And I'll tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign.
0.0	0.173193475869	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
0.0	0.359232706078	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.506964948312	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.25114544444	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.0724015903122	Thank you.
0.0	0.0510144184089	He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
0.0	0.259354189945	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.
0.0	0.0589334996212	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.370674559758	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.0716493636708	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.716676327885	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
0.0	0.115112995778	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.339208793514	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.0472351539725	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.057201301217	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.172655416944	We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.
0.0	0.173733665991	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.348543711558	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.233709710553	So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.
0.0	0.0311350583	So, so important.
0.0	0.221811211568	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.394827499518	Great state, great people.
0.0	0.141488513532	If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say?
0.0	0.683205244006	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.257775731322	I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
0.0	0.294849561563	It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.
0.0	0.254272395743	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.28308847585	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.
0.0	0.295628721658	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.0842970550653	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.213835285848	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.199914805285	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.587644863039	I am on the committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.0306490777112	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.47884162386	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.122327305959	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.319910846889	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.0724015903122	Thank you.
0.0	0.127985730016	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.0180781396961	Think about it.
0.0	0.144997868598	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.266924196571	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.533956266414	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.620316447809	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.191637130089	You did.
0.0	0.0846132248711	Well, sure.
0.0	0.0265159767574	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.124735624809	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.142891301801	But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
0.0	0.288588293467	They should be Muslim troops.
0.0	0.132643766676	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.173715630919	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.72311555517	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
0.0	0.389033021186	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.309319357033	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.405927928541	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.255060639253	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.415040819468	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.454977415315	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
0.0	0.323380403832	Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country.
0.0	0.5	So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.
0.0	0.277791997617	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.0888547340551	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.506557483144	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.11259963832	I would prioritize them.
0.0	0.246910447334	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.195546396109	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.106266692571	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
1.0	0.973197048216	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.195493550423	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
1.0	0.918304440893	In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.
0.0	0.229956318728	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.0921144403612	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.41537206816	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.0929657555953	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.06834521615	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.288558816105	No, John.
0.0	0.356148598485	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.0813208334282	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.174396228173	And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.
0.0	0.158244971689	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.134948780712	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.243469687636	And we have to do more to prevent the flood of foreign fighters that have gone to Syria, especially the ones with western passports, that come back.
0.0	0.802230681326	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.0624537873499	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.12045464984	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.391590086053	But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks."
0.0	0.610301409864	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.
0.0	0.268183547956	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.286422465896	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.433962687099	Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?
0.0	0.22169445792	Well, I would just repeat that.
0.0	0.016051683822	It won't happen.
0.0	0.115103332116	Martha, if I may...
0.0	0.0842450462972	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.184343748151	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.
0.0	0.119398593312	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.210904399168	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.351497484143	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.726176061389	... people all over this country -- not you, Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other.
0.0	0.123788126523	Now, this is getting to be fun.
0.0	0.5	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.437743032529	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
0.0	0.105285595066	Lehman Brothers was not a big bank.
0.0	0.542493623594	So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating, but the highest median income in America.
1.0	0.98692823286	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.320529862339	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.121337680308	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
1.0	0.459834673545	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.152154467734	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.0734198889085	You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America.
0.0	0.25859626198	They wanted Boeing's secrets.
0.0	0.257291151896	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.0734275737343	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.
0.0	0.20889795834	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
0.0	0.540607508833	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.185114933551	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.206102606568	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.041996780741	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.220100263124	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.256027969904	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.377287062615	Tear down the EPA's blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates.
0.0	0.128247231348	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.280451576416	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.0883929267247	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.5	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.344867679075	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.075316917389	Carly Fiorina.
1.0	0.922842692781	And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions.
0.0	0.3547052818	in particular.
0.0	0.0730611110211	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.743752458908	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.0827622652673	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.456162243873	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.0987011005008	In addition to that...
0.0	0.176106832465	And, we said no.
0.0	0.0324895174775	I can.
0.0	0.583549625451	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.247498589891	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.191637130089	Why is it...
0.0	0.582786444699	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.12505007189	And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
0.0	0.0162621026382	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.0992724230246	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.253420425591	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.448457160624	The nature of warfare has changed.
0.0	0.126798402157	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.313085310765	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.183921786641	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.415589252038	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.232356404278	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.294443292468	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.594705513486	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.0718951373914	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.789066477548	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.21198927737	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.0324895174775	And we can do it.
0.0	0.313453470669	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.191569952074	Yes.
0.0	0.0067604116021	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.593588843061	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
1.0	1.0	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.0911752505075	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.119443217311	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.456618114295	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.0768813866992	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.182531989466	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.187363035188	Good at email.
0.0	0.533398808014	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
0.0	0.100431979602	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.370095122036	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.141058204735	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.403178829558	That's not the role of the government.
1.0	0.999997996189	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.262224483114	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.282601062409	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.308719632414	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.249566538859	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.252603021735	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.0581911446591	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.386786717195	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.0505566608346	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.2466080798	... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.323415587657	There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America.
0.0	0.236879794543	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
0.0	0.0528317072438	I don't care.
0.0	0.0782217374482	These are very, very real issues.
0.0	0.31790088184	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.0341871338093	Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.
0.0	0.320108889844	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.0605681502072	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.0559960768846	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.289836487537	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.264427499845	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.163995549126	Martha, may I -- Martha, may I...
0.0	0.0826905740809	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.257928055896	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.0734350389318	Well, I've got news for you, we can.
0.0	0.0926008323601	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.738132124965	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.203282774389	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.134300096005	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.201796979814	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.405767514454	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.115516540104	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.512480342375	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.296062626781	But it's a lot safer.
0.0	0.288980588239	... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do.
1.0	0.954893909035	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.207229438571	Well, David, I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country.
0.0	0.586114470566	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.160012212381	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.780196756307	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.
0.0	0.32906862878	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
0.0	0.0608450017463	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.12138893655	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.318657243913	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.416633209261	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.156755054044	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.279702549319	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.805612311112	hospital that needs to be improved and made better for them turned over to privatization.
0.0	0.128958571136	Maybe now we can get it moving again so that we can upgrade it so that it does include all the tools and everything in our arsenal that we can use to try to work with our allies and our friends, come up with better intelligence.
0.0	0.201904416004	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.0333891888742	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.515179914759	I think that is the number one requirement.
1.0	0.321494916075	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.159597875582	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.229420545827	And you have to really work hard at it.
0.0	0.0193824789359	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.0134393274653	I like China.
0.0	0.255622149828	It has too much economic power.
0.0	0.28984342919	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.158454151433	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.862236789032	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.319321964553	For her convenience.
0.0	0.573471819137	We have a corrupt campaign finance system dominated by Super PACs.
0.0	0.169936837919	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.573811582896	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.212694798757	And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.
0.0	0.248096235633	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.43679645352	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.241855645541	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.
0.0	0.238069969531	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.
0.0	0.280906788738	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.776008559861	In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.
0.0	0.0529938656649	We get Bergdahl.
0.0	0.918280813338	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.29012556505	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.168189094049	It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably -- probably -- from the Middle East.
0.0	0.348847798373	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.191892128296	Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."
0.0	0.246486811009	There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
0.0	0.191637130089	What are we doing?
0.0	0.0300738534088	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.0586823811036	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.121771423492	People say, "Oh, you don't like China?"
0.0	0.379886843252	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
1.0	0.401633663158	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.0164092628804	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.415513076466	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.277802853199	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.506485141773	He thinks low wages are a good idea.
0.0	0.32156485711	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.0809533328978	Let me respond...
0.0	0.343530269879	But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.
0.0	0.411585467899	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.705259332933	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.350004926481	And second of all...
0.0	0.249192254676	I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country.
0.0	0.658204282985	Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
0.0	0.121684822269	I do and this is an important issue and I know we'll get to a lot of other critical ones as well.
0.0	0.228892051653	I made it when I ran in 2008.
0.0	0.533044165123	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.128019359348	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.276534386205	In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill, "Well I assume Hillary has told you about this."
0.0	0.305754611231	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.370158752534	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.0907815947185	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
0.0	0.00469758867169	They can't.
0.0	0.02015647486	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.611343232118	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...
0.0	0.0785755688816	Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.
0.0	0.513883067847	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.
0.0	0.372381566632	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.0727398004151	And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?
0.0	0.360916794595	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.344340741597	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.0604326818706	That can be done.
0.0	0.191637130089	It's not.
0.0	0.308571398255	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.587552562554	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.217812639495	When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.
0.0	0.0299626977154	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.028348231583	I have to tell you.
0.0	0.901001485149	Seventeen more million more people have health care.
0.0	0.990732293816	$1 billion a day.
0.0	0.571610238602	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0927106059663	I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
0.0	0.494717978125	I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place.
0.0	0.0236561922192	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.129308434684	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.184731751831	The central question in this race is trust.
0.0	0.376876494277	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.47686547675	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.254319582972	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.063575359797	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.252735251667	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.153235960953	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.248157955884	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.098688939249	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.837296689853	We have artificially low interest rates.
0.0	0.182970285281	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.136756005737	If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen.
0.0	0.64283570002	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.160738224666	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
0.0	0.143955044726	All right, Nancy, I really wish you'd come back to me on this on this one, John...
0.0	0.741508086219	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.40293156551	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.149804558636	Now, here's what is going to happen.
0.0	0.277176123099	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.402990653027	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.191569952074	Yes.
0.0	0.315509258876	And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.175665884968	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.188855970761	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.143273058902	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.0815741355467	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.278646922242	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.050084680216	All right.
0.0	0.274863755566	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.241444557891	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.412158884586	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.0894466373603	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.261469521704	We have to stop the money flow.
1.0	0.999998986247	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
0.0	0.110492977866	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.274611300547	You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.
0.0	0.455090384776	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.106243258688	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.0371975605687	Our president doesn't have a clue.
0.0	0.214922241247	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.518743426223	We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.
0.0	0.115479757652	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.

0.0	0.189382993035	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.191914994423	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.290056299719	And here's the problem in this country right now.
1.0	0.419837315144	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.275145093753	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.

0.0	0.308906283225	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.14375767659	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.
0.0	0.280629586941	I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.

0.0	0.120904140677	You're simply not.
0.0	0.352177177281	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.309384707869	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.0719291296218	Washington is broken.
0.0	0.0985202575723	But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting.
0.0	0.00112418449701	Look--
0.0	0.102078195963	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.700582562811	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.0731942548813	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.233852933511	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.360331177428	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.466236441327	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
1.0	0.999989277168	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.

0.0	0.338002315776	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.332234166127	They're going to take away thousands of jobs.
0.0	0.0947450786565	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.250206611658	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.319091055286	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.297933488687	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.576480389103	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.231423712656	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.11268109227	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.812800328409	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.115004754913	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.370566969759	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.228129007453	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.196895622477	We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.
0.0	0.339264335233	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.147249581782	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.
0.0	0.529106921645	You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super PAC and they're advertising against me in Iowa as we speak.
0.0	0.211624410808	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.194187223505	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
0.0	0.234755462882	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.330888778977	I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.
0.0	0.111871867247	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.196372234986	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.191637130089	And why?
0.0	0.416091257148	Now, I understand that this is very difficult.
0.0	0.00807368179596	They're off to China.
0.0	0.191569952074	Yes.
0.0	0.10323952863	It never happens.
0.0	0.533574072194	This is absolutely absurd.
0.0	0.44457589618	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.700903392252	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.184450560256	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.311386811158	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.307430946316	Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.
0.0	0.857129449642	They would have to pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.040969682549	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.236554561994	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.0984365776716	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
0.0	0.107392700519	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.263265112791	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...
0.0	0.0173425286089	And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.
0.0	0.45860995351	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.13411848477	This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.
0.0	0.285031835083	As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that.
0.0	0.100696078999	And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
0.0	0.18930705522	That is exactly...
0.0	0.176641878356	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.0634233968288	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.050084680216	Right.
0.0	0.471341815829	So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.
0.0	0.379719220383	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.0174758602409	They're terrified by the saber rattling.
0.0	0.204130679173	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.061770047138	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.387666400689	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.279779656504	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.329610041475	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.122430349842	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.387447188774	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.113846960246	So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
0.0	0.70009565863	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.11614602006	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.0917788833463	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.381631973279	John, I would disagree with Secretary Clinton respectfully on this score.
0.0	0.30448658192	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.0609498723409	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.430143788599	This is a complicated issue.
0.0	0.359833237023	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.229236359329	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.253479106126	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.0316225228917	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.0456600013421	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.142753874333	I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.
0.0	0.342599131284	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
0.0	0.0232799834041	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.469473230372	We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq.
0.0	0.200005106849	We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.
0.0	0.348028783423	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.394521922453	But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.
0.0	0.0323930452458	We need a collaborative approach.
0.0	0.216577192762	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.757037314287	Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor.
0.0	0.677470958963	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.167119236318	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.158678112231	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.305762557034	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.136747452985	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.0692027334248	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.
0.0	0.469441805565	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.295094602514	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.828009875733	Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.
0.0	0.643696212869	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.18209889585	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
1.0	0.999991697336	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
0.0	0.296288597733	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.107527512271	I've done it.
0.0	0.0715901547111	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.043093177067	Here's what I'd do.
0.0	0.670008434168	Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country.
0.0	0.88755980757	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.271844139276	But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue -- requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.370813810354	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
0.0	0.179232683089	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.63097645517	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
1.0	0.627602222707	It's never below zero.
0.0	0.346667207254	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.241362269789	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
0.0	0.389309639498	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...
0.0	0.045472440359	No vision at all.
0.0	0.356667243476	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.

0.0	0.574946482941	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.0998308444193	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.154831749213	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.2653042622	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.292313019342	Doctors are quitting.
0.0	0.192916956674	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.207762846609	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.198278308334	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.178127284325	Absolutely.
0.0	0.932023873533	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.289129562567	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.19090117633	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.113386362188	I just want a job.

0.0	0.637658605581	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.12537129621	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.339248153662	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.156774865977	Just get me a job.

0.0	0.152341794115	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.

0.0	0.571583307062	I spent a lot of time in the situation room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us.
0.0	0.267220851345	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.161217790859	We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.
0.0	0.148500811783	Maria, I'd just like to say...

0.0	0.0726428904382	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.050084680216	That's right.
0.0	0.141095333793	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.410945733427	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.0669052938185	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.607980197554	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.404597223688	And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.

0.0	0.392592980664	It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.
0.0	0.277420990443	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.102727709157	So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
0.0	0.7209661506	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.050084680216	Right.
1.0	0.514872959872	I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded.
0.0	0.143282578707	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.0833216735755	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.445316858361	First of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy, as you've indicated.
0.0	0.0857187267165	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.0717863701043	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.372840386877	That's the wrong number.
0.0	0.0781661481685	Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire.
0.0	0.440403709076	And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country.
0.0	0.151145319314	We must able to work collaboratively with others.
0.0	0.0789623724066	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.209415649278	You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future.
0.0	0.191833141935	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.237557188662	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.0656125039281	I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.
0.0	0.366015289665	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.176479358059	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.219717677975	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.0616460871211	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.0495395825514	You're right.
0.0	0.71787606319	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
0.0	0.44611369709	It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.
0.0	0.0556857277852	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.321389795344	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.140337176172	Whoever heard of this?
0.0	0.171081937812	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
1.0	0.952024931515	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
0.0	0.301554616952	That's calling it what it is.
0.0	0.76523281505	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.342188163679	Yes, I apologize.
0.0	0.240476010237	Go to YouTube.
0.0	0.0332813950468	That's when we become Greece.
0.0	0.209893090073	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.252876860549	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.428096640279	Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.
0.0	0.153194600534	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.318893033836	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.0160096338717	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.0868126008211	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.234006784907	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.203515520571	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.0277842885427	He's very charming.
0.0	0.0341865124897	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.22716398494	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.238973354146	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.016587826624	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.050084680216	That's not right.
0.0	0.196661066862	And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent.
0.0	0.0761489665181	You're certainly not very good.
0.0	0.0289718641162	Here's what I believe.
0.0	0.191637130089	No.
0.0	0.371748279924	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.337440861265	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.919519948559	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.094862509548	They kill us.
0.0	0.314741907005	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.349833217421	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.598578549961	You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.0289323401983	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.109972930002	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.48345630126	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.045970857215	Sure did.
0.0	0.191637130089	What do we do?
0.0	0.544075306404	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.199750648739	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.174511512845	Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly.
0.0	0.13099996311	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.0567351231887	And I think has had a big impact.
0.0	0.565151816529	I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.
0.0	0.0581149062733	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.342831990103	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.34418290018	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.509792919301	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
0.0	0.391719436222	We need to end minimal sentencing.
0.0	0.0794924222189	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.245787774251	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.0266983576642	Neil...
0.0	0.112702915726	That would be a disaster for this country.
0.0	0.0921015032603	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.28316115958	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.116119121096	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.2366600988	We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.
0.0	0.900665261969	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.338092090861	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.578170494722	But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said.
0.0	0.16915631575	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.350825357606	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.289752789817	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.0693464637169	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.263953950805	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.363546979326	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.191637130089	And...
0.0	0.077527846037	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.131019766826	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.191569952074	Yes.
0.0	0.269962264609	And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
0.0	0.0412403355826	You know, the situation is this.
0.0	0.231501034523	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.234693329173	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.294525672969	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.111968133961	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.024621954624	How has it worked?
0.0	0.0358353311602	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.0429575275979	But they're not good.
0.0	0.115236730702	And that this world, with American leadership, can and must come together to destroy them.
0.0	0.154588232238	People who we should be welcoming and working with.
0.0	0.112126863194	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.447654011909	They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.
0.0	0.163859079926	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.355771805062	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.163280965934	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.57452703892	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.185594812413	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.170463892957	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.100446849021	You want one?
0.0	0.0779852354541	May I respond to the critique on the ...
0.0	0.0549423452441	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.131762820763	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.381038917348	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.33924345045	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.32273075231	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.20632068836	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.0845177646124	That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.
0.0	0.0773514951005	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.0305030715932	That's the big leagues.
0.0	0.113043222623	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.358535599244	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.365370968752	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.832341323262	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.225390164641	And we need the right people.
0.0	0.179203759266	I am the son and grandson of immigrants.
0.0	0.204075383431	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.0972024041145	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.354167422487	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.174113542714	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.14529806634	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.0572342591343	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.
0.0	0.158221303849	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.486575181077	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.123539298165	What would we do if this were ebola?
0.0	0.114920317178	Look, the secretary is right.
0.0	0.158910339786	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.365479453207	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.0289718641162	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.0773480584165	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...
1.0	0.964658886539	We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.
0.0	0.129961715244	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
0.0	0.048562473171	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.0661904717127	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.335860014345	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.158547633116	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.298691007804	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.313687748109	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.0580776996201	I agree completely.
0.0	0.148831782111	We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
0.0	0.411713936709	Meanwhile, the rich get richer.
0.0	0.36298688022	Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity.
0.0	0.173751575126	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.543813455583	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.107527512271	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.529124492745	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.341394495395	The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.
0.0	0.41795759619	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.362434215604	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.179051918443	We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it.
0.0	0.0259641318553	I happen to think...
0.0	0.135237115716	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.5	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.262891848535	But I agree, as I mentioned a moment ago, with King Abdullah.
0.0	0.120757657219	And we also need a cheerleader.
0.0	0.395213310367	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.923605006484	She voted for it.
0.0	0.0742310278504	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.482678364876	The simple fact is, we all have a record.
0.0	0.742213859629	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.0917522628498	Alright.
0.0	0.46948313335	She led that effort.
0.0	0.228585982689	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.27509768275	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.0428883512886	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.119843764786	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
1.0	0.108088150975	He's not wall street.
0.0	0.191637130089	Have to do it.
0.0	0.5	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.301325487553	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.0786010415709	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.566030264439	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.158025102177	Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face.
1.0	0.819669371859	$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work.
0.0	0.410437324058	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.196540937665	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.12692746743	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.340396079637	To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.
1.0	0.799431044797	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
0.0	0.191083613027	But at the end of the day, no doubt, the Affordable Care Act is a step forward.
0.0	0.419003737938	There's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.
0.0	0.0351103544427	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.350465828571	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.138604265593	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.191637130089	...
0.0	0.0264729978498	Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.
0.0	0.10024179965	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.539786511218	There are a lot of factors involved in that.
0.0	0.257906012005	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.433839888732	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.242132781106	He is not the only one.

0.0	0.240134029201	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.0952375474557	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.456979639107	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
0.0	0.30044084833	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.043114106376	That's who I'm indebted to.
0.0	0.719460345953	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.0371572051656	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.415767535976	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.415636765523	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.333333812616	They're not supporting our law enforcement officers, it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.263475426726	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.571608780049	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
1.0	0.58489127769	It was below zero.
0.0	0.29211464573	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.252531895419	ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries.
0.0	0.166038132469	Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer.
0.0	0.0944081929439	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.571540503956	This country is changing.
0.0	0.549669453298	I was not the secretary of state...
0.0	0.231619630337	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.147072627071	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.141038574795	Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process.
0.0	0.381197551051	We have tremendous people.
0.0	0.959679805844	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.18322543986	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.0581012815995	They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
0.0	0.461562721279	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.482960648088	Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
0.0	0.472413576846	And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues.
0.0	0.442093036849	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.717703060228	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.244573493578	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...

0.0	0.0262643463723	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.088594924489	But not for us.
0.0	0.372890142195	I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.
0.0	0.419718878061	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.0321400739305	I think it's a two-pronged issue.
0.0	0.304173421024	In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston.
0.0	0.0655731293255	Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
0.0	0.132292563602	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.451739305251	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.309346179727	I think I am a nice person.
0.0	0.410764618182	Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform.
0.0	0.169222291633	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.362664589615	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.232264152291	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.
0.0	0.22145145959	And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.
0.0	0.448510477559	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.274493999389	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.131695370023	When you come back to me, I'll share that story.
0.0	0.288540660102	We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.
0.0	0.810302131014	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.140939878135	We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.
0.0	0.172366121802	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.12435473958	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.115764068377	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.142714098644	I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization.
0.0	0.050084680216	All right.
0.0	0.121411855488	He's the greatest show on earth.
0.0	0.412384183689	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.238021512665	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
1.0	0.832932076084	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.0832340028739	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.128538788766	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.681651413919	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.654207927459	But Secretary Clinton is wrong.
0.0	0.386615757776	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.0882825305699	But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up.
0.0	0.0718703669479	So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.
0.0	0.284386894074	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.227615627169	That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive.
0.0	0.238642016862	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.362001048732	But, I said, "This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people.
0.0	0.5	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.562112344253	No, it's true.
0.0	0.178255553199	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.413636434797	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.429604600979	Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.
0.0	0.2333793348	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.308981159428	Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world.
0.0	0.0510159112855	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.0200310823612	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.543628406059	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.0791787456449	And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.
0.0	0.0413093803385	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.115060586535	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.254302106726	And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.
0.0	0.576757020322	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.168523423572	Please go to hillaryclinton.com and be part of making this country what we know it can and should be.
0.0	0.0892130240644	OK, good.
0.0	0.0639760069278	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.118375618904	And it's just not going to work.
0.0	0.156560859478	Sorry.
0.0	0.184006806778	I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom.
0.0	0.0287010097341	So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there.
0.0	0.254422839961	And she turned around many lives.
0.0	0.194289071227	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.314576572252	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.
0.0	0.0648795197326	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.0537548281807	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
0.0	0.00112418449701	But look...
0.0	0.10544059808	I said, "I gotta go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.798402107821	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.270981440371	We can in fact create jobs and provide job security.
0.0	0.0126240113692	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.509455515064	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.292909337595	If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.
0.0	0.147093623745	Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.
0.0	0.383614828312	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.118581622308	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.214789511531	My wife, Jane, has been -- way back when before I knew her, a foster parent.
0.0	0.223704220328	... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street.
0.0	0.164143393179	It will give hope to millions of young people.
0.0	0.821706202748	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.137572200786	From top to bottom.
0.0	0.13634277647	The CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary.
0.0	0.0915537368702	Let it be for everybody.
0.0	0.959564372905	We got $18 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.402953191665	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.0967209728025	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.423369606092	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.294550955406	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.181385723515	I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path.
0.0	0.259638194916	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.533698180395	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.539732829545	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.16826764491	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.
0.0	0.102863441446	If he'd like to play, that's fine.
0.0	0.233477065955	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.191637130089	What do we do?
0.0	0.101715521581	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.330420906394	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.519356357766	Kathie, that is the kind of economy I believe, put money in the hands of working people, raise the minimum wage to 15 buck an hour.
0.0	0.336141607292	At the end of the day, if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities.
0.0	0.314235894009	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.114887612585	So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.
0.0	0.144127180822	We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation.
0.0	0.317191514237	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.
0.0	0.53621855208	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.698718771115	Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs.
0.0	0.265216009858	Everybody should.
0.0	0.23690850819	All of us believe climate change is real.
0.0	0.399146596126	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.381600715078	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
0.0	0.16617496026	We need to do it now as a nation.
0.0	0.260278278593	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.582798278474	So I said, "That's OK." I'm proud of my net worth.
0.0	0.105029349717	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.272968627204	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.428930511711	But, bottom line is this is the year 2015.
0.0	0.163018656922	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.227597435737	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.0576230055737	Are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not?
0.0	0.513877786565	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.329301755649	He said, "we have the military in the streets right now.
0.0	0.187924997421	Otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.
0.0	0.764235765742	Millions coming out of school as you indicated, deeply in debt.
0.0	0.267107222637	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.300569217039	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.
0.0	0.791347031077	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.218336043176	And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion, this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us, and that we stand with them as they have stood with us.
0.0	0.0724015903122	Thank you.
0.0	0.0821424712275	He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long.
0.0	0.256070208585	But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says.
1.0	0.948064198207	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.209673750527	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.399463185992	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.411642824355	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.140696828396	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.330438167922	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.132557044446	On January 20th, 2017, the next president of the United States will walk into the White House.
0.0	0.224386561661	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.290141554811	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.134448415159	We saw a Muslim brotherhood president installed, and then we saw him ousted and the army back.
0.0	0.185509824319	It goes away.
0.0	0.253962323511	I've done an amazing job.
1.0	0.290648753322	They built a hotel.
0.0	0.455445592663	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.262177437561	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.122899795592	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.452154425877	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.429493308101	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.0737252486909	It ain't complicated.
0.0	0.074863727232	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.26440346654	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.236437288956	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.191637130089	...
0.0	0.364833987779	I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider.
0.0	0.0825025615728	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.260794797784	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.652076100158	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.383313694642	It's a divided country on guns.

0.0	0.303601889884	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.788463471526	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.

0.0	0.144421351445	I don't think anyone has a magical solution.
1.0	0.91107296626	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.116007665147	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.061907185233	He'll say.
0.0	0.40202955134	The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.
0.0	0.466877270777	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.176580591353	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.0402057570951	I think he is right.
0.0	0.0213006605829	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.249974992771	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.213916792025	But, of course, international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today.
0.0	0.478683165876	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.

0.0	0.144328262187	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
0.0	0.481751861552	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.228317368542	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.

0.0	0.392939705114	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.035727309174	I have no idea.
0.0	0.441715950227	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.336699967747	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.91684626067	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.25286194375	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.272310546296	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.239025886193	At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically.
0.0	0.125118367428	And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.0289323401983	They don't know what they're doing.

0.0	0.0900171393422	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.239560948775	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.110809671322	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.351078620056	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.309793433847	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.119448451669	It's Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.
0.0	0.0612403757313	But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.
0.0	0.612059293214	It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act.
0.0	0.54479804617	But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America.
0.0	0.0742351247216	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.334517734595	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.0724539445644	Nothing's gonna get done.
0.0	0.138106231069	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.28008177958	And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.
0.0	0.196696233553	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.
1.0	0.312826524119	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.195809507498	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.467249269156	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.150769530871	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.13725811721	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
1.0	0.278390598889	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.0633507589405	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.662740243144	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.283668595518	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.368288663502	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.93299851015	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.0862737643309	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.0583338006877	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.0365915033271	They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.
0.0	0.51092786941	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.548860840536	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.141417297008	I (inaudible).
0.0	0.381956208659	They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.
0.0	0.332286568941	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.114170948599	I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.
0.0	0.132720020755	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.238651158425	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
1.0	0.548540504563	You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small.
1.0	0.225338112951	Well, John, look, I think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis to leave by 2011, is that an Iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend Iraq.
0.0	0.072272809449	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.383172933179	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
0.0	0.246084128861	And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that.
0.0	0.1255263398	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.390167798865	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.655199241281	I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.
0.0	0.81947276872	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.438671634968	And I have to tell you, I would not want -- if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my health care.
0.0	0.0704807591913	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.281884162396	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.792673107502	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.194347376581	I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.
0.0	0.813752628532	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.906002608444	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.192367528144	But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.
0.0	0.590852061969	Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage.
0.0	0.466008554949	And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.
0.0	0.0565903450885	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.0810199246325	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.152370634299	Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough.
0.0	0.442359954689	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.0996447656008	That's fine.
0.0	0.113371507385	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.332787484271	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.532496276487	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.0835684342207	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.0615852657518	And you know what?
0.0	0.122923580578	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.050084680216	All right.
0.0	0.475718043325	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.272695683675	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.06594909795	They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).
0.0	0.263522051942	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.31801668899	But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that.
0.0	0.53913505528	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
0.0	0.653949142761	Well, I'm kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time.
0.0	0.163499825042	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.328396483623	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.447817334343	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.227118384246	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.216631886016	They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea.
0.0	0.0761464061492	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.516717219539	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.335880763143	... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.
0.0	0.179706480742	And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears.
0.0	0.103538904859	They can provide forces.
0.0	0.44236278511	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.0724015903122	Thank you.
0.0	0.260711265387	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.111221846911	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.297588085368	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.180274886239	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.241251511021	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
1.0	0.929896538636	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
0.0	0.5	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.115610098433	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.106140503437	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.102452814141	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.
0.0	0.0675839952556	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.44244338755	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.103802124774	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.0136340430875	It is a disaster.
0.0	0.15698896102	I'm getting to that.
0.0	0.271628140573	And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.610590971525	We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital.
0.0	0.301917306653	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.390452418302	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.157625051641	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.824606088575	But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.
0.0	0.402308297058	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.5	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	0.562112344253	That's not true.
0.0	0.698539152482	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.058084711512	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.446963781175	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.310497116308	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.779721818573	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.787947859477	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.298279856972	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.0147745884133	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.331190897492	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.147518940469	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.629022600975	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.115208036196	And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.
0.0	0.0485752745411	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.024621954624	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.374796482316	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.241380384559	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.182077029603	Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, "Sorry, fellas.
0.0	0.148209791209	I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
0.0	0.360592824306	It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.
0.0	0.14445304619	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.160670716421	Enough said.
0.0	0.342930510676	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
0.0	0.191637130089	It was.
0.0	0.356869368586	First of all...
0.0	0.663545562725	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.319872589456	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.256515282648	As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.
0.0	0.268183547956	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.647026294498	They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.
0.0	0.209748076559	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.102342806321	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.0579301765116	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.0476227234777	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.385253072893	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.259828993838	And, of course, I met the mothers of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, and Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and so many of them who have lost their children.
0.0	0.0369106303124	It can happen.
0.0	0.597331643827	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.212685175602	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.37026695499	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
0.0	0.293043012924	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
0.0	0.508258364608	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.0235916013212	We have losers.
0.0	0.14352674141	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.146742237534	That will change everything.
0.0	0.0508095122736	He couldn't answer the question.
0.0	0.0874515219219	David, I am the very first...
0.0	0.110845680974	One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together.
0.0	0.35125457165	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.579179900376	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.0483967500513	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.210090572958	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.00838146502382	Maria...
0.0	0.21571439249	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.184089066701	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.694922987551	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
1.0	0.592744062388	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.100545074595	And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
0.0	0.191637130089	No.
0.0	0.0397736463781	How are we gonna -- how are we gonna go back and make it great again?
0.0	0.317617053587	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
0.0	0.153732420414	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.450917567024	And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending.
0.0	0.147072627071	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.276427314087	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.282429752385	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.00469758867169	I can't do it.
0.0	0.119496360174	I would invite him, I actually would say.
0.0	0.168001206232	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.292074625822	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.159270004901	She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship.
0.0	0.582902243948	Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.
0.0	0.252811929818	You know where their United States headquarters is located?
0.0	0.0304864742036	...Chris...
0.0	0.908880823625	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.407596344646	Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.
0.0	0.706486647094	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.33439982398	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.791813662729	By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started.
1.0	0.666651078365	Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion.
0.0	0.511556695692	They're a scam.
0.0	0.131432334855	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.
0.0	0.164584259066	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.316803114463	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.39937735805	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
0.0	0.508025387241	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.36138934266	Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
0.0	0.287002835176	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.453614061301	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.207153256494	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.359732030443	I will put a price tag.
1.0	0.878305673556	In fact, wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century, after my husband's administration.
0.0	0.0367167038824	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.0641923544219	You want to know why things don't get done in Washington?
0.0	0.480238107691	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.210167525259	I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.226751028164	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.170780811262	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.533956266414	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0308717909941	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.2384520446	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.195359669861	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.101806361514	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.659564787619	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.257978784035	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.46219196487	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.077987150126	Let me give you the bad news.
0.0	0.0688447521604	And here's what's going to happen.
0.0	0.301141807258	You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question.
0.0	0.517869220198	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
1.0	0.999989753028	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.148110848144	When do we beat Mexico at the border?
0.0	0.115791545521	And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce's great story.
0.0	0.106013925891	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?
0.0	0.0134677132362	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.0181379373505	Then I looked at Rubio.
0.0	0.177290158144	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.358811231065	Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe.
0.0	0.335880228952	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.170832779015	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.269102094465	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.228392443842	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
0.0	0.253902204319	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.507294594874	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.684802079426	And, unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage, I actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.399919078057	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.527621606852	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.25767148535	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.256549552422	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.27647677038	And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms.
0.0	0.0712827527858	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.074963984062	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
0.0	0.0943091248494	And they wanted to make sure it got built.
0.0	0.177565514008	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.92231274655	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.704287270121	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.270105898223	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.0427652521064	I have formed them.
1.0	0.782998704674	Nancy, the blueprint in Maryland that we followed was yes, we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment.
0.0	0.561460656709	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.506926455291	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.0346901031992	He was young.
0.0	0.134755513171	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.131573192713	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.239386620949	Like we have a -- we have a lot of work to do and we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do.
0.0	0.0788647385934	Yeah, but let me respond...
0.0	0.37679842515	More importantly, I want kids in Burlington, Vermont, or Baltimore, Maryland, who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade, who don't have a lot of money, whose parents -- like my parents -- may never have gone to college.
0.0	0.120731725316	Did she do a great job?
0.0	0.379896330394	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.115057573613	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.126967817744	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.5743627488	But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.
0.0	0.249204485498	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.562689477994	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.0666882534905	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.0667656737816	Yeah.
0.0	0.0143305654814	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.225269875362	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.213971751674	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.135187305683	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.0311964033574	That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
0.0	0.376695528098	I believe that our Federal Government needs to do more on pell grants.
0.0	0.0615852657518	We know...
0.0	0.900070290925	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.105746065649	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.5	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.270725074074	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.35442705193	So many companies are going to leave our country.
1.0	0.973150364707	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.227759536436	Martha -- I would just repeat that --
0.0	0.562112344253	It's not true.
0.0	0.0609155281138	And I've been there.
0.0	0.371746741127	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.978676436431	Could we loan you $4 billion"?
0.0	0.531942387215	I think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12 it would be the highest historical average we've ever had.
0.0	0.202862834176	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.1314139537	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.721687218682	When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish Glass-Stegall.
0.0	0.111116730766	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.132724019096	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.155895234918	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.212313447164	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.252768013531	Now, our country needs -- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
0.0	0.00415283010111	The mentally ill?
0.0	0.176939597109	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.181384322047	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.511266613321	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.779413763329	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
1.0	0.139049688754	They're rapists.
0.0	0.250086105227	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.0587506174181	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.297074641687	You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now -- it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run.
0.0	0.328823244399	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.517233121322	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.322707276697	Reinstating Glass- Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough.
0.0	0.0881642510783	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.134755513171	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.564718893661	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.200185439671	Media notwithstanding.
0.0	0.154176473735	Is creating much deeper, closer relations and, yes, coalitions within our own country.
0.0	0.191569952074	Yes.
1.0	0.412493615377	Unfortunately, Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, set about decimating it.
0.0	0.20811365934	And who's compromised and who is principled.
0.0	0.0738572369739	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.40294452168	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.33801882661	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.916659111528	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.313959935166	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.15626197382	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.172445291237	... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience.
0.0	0.312057980589	And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.
0.0	0.26821805973	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.191637130089	How?
0.0	0.266564194483	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.42035841045	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.602034739957	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.125664706638	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.291640407839	This is a terribly complicated issue.
0.0	0.258166234557	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.0809928863876	I'll give you another example.
0.0	0.0791494022088	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.0910253683041	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.116156556146	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.416635714919	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.454143079047	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.109949411117	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.270467007973	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.0349112609331	But what -- I will tell you this.

0.0	0.201834034772	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.191569151659	Bigger than that?

0.0	0.523203157789	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.178655681688	You can go to my website...
0.0	0.755418061791	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
1.0	0.967123543701	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.

0.0	0.35178278778	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.0505566608346	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.202834484802	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
0.0	0.401853951674	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.

0.0	0.0985709688968	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.

0.0	0.357699357701	That's American citizenship.
0.0	0.134161529972	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.0604019318358	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.38900606899	The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans.

0.0	0.333556879962	They have no plan now."
0.0	0.0630006897914	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.0981150158035	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
0.0	0.730403590601	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.156297560371	And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.
0.0	0.302822897033	I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.

0.0	0.15558868564	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.296758586917	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.201137669954	Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country -- we would never build in an ocean.
0.0	0.470014215183	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.148814980203	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.247473951642	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.340056471847	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.453435420809	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.
0.0	0.329664223411	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.312950004148	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
0.0	0.281363535129	Now we're having smaller families.
1.0	0.999999999875	And again, paid for.

0.0	0.337784112032	He cut and run.
0.0	0.53633371148	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.361044140632	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
0.0	0.138059621081	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.272522216364	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.

0.0	0.115738635844	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
1.0	0.959089374119	It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.
0.0	0.346181722614	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.

0.0	0.224872849411	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.999999363203	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.158870432976	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.045970857215	That's for sure.
0.0	0.335192843376	And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go.
0.0	0.395771427453	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.107599354183	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.0570166557574	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.
0.0	0.340966093775	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.318284762073	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.308575201408	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.275836844204	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.147441543403	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.
0.0	0.444401045393	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.184452380108	Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe.

0.0	0.383599703101	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.366159633237	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.0887748220553	Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.
0.0	0.397496513733	So, yes, I did know people.
0.0	0.0808620914892	We need more principle.
0.0	0.319085653915	But if you place good ones, you pocket it.
0.0	0.33255134719	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.00469758867169	We can't do it.
0.0	0.14202931878	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.0669734559418	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.

0.0	0.0914148561908	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.164670054378	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.096955446773	This will end.
0.0	0.284703920515	First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.

0.0	0.316662551314	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.0442121823346	I will be ready.
0.0	0.241141750465	The first vote hasn't been counted.
0.0	0.262591269474	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.0548079148413	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
0.0	0.262468167305	That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them.
0.0	0.109990553584	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.
0.0	0.633432872143	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.19311232301	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.445220964474	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.285872021714	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.00520006412935	I didn't.
0.0	0.3780919369	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.0402057570951	I think so, right.

0.0	0.0941601942636	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.531001395914	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.229850014	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.374887027921	Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military.
0.0	0.173303746602	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.137626014361	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.194467047027	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.367034055342	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.0190044933717	Creativity.
0.0	0.080669194524	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.206519943093	Check it out.
0.0	0.179975467766	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.218265947792	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.097400139006	Look, the -- the deal is already done.

0.0	0.205176729731	Wall Street is a threat to the economy.
0.0	0.364326435846	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.334783781635	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.365180815475	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.178127284325	Absolutely.
0.0	0.264658931712	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.349251452319	I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out.
0.0	0.0633801963014	It feels different.
0.0	0.434319425087	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.135435463173	I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
0.0	0.268062047528	You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down.
0.0	0.1837820659	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.237970393879	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.832341323262	Of course not.
0.0	0.650163969423	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.0438536645779	Excuse me.
0.0	0.179822631119	A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this.
0.0	0.678045460036	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.435268979384	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.158145370885	What we know is we're living longer.

0.0	0.348847798373	Thank you very, very much.
0.0	0.0836192968491	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.965729625843	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.186563287523	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.121729362511	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.424554090793	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.246400228109	If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.
0.0	0.771668224729	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.55004398056	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.131540514421	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.202012277208	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.0188030156671	He was vibrant.
0.0	0.397158089827	ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.
0.0	0.0354510759136	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.481121237748	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.83051611454	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.654452464384	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.245508645275	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.
0.0	0.0433331807305	But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.165635830474	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.910978190563	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.197784488508	The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.
0.0	0.782215624992	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.31639612876	And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.
0.0	0.109843523825	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.159274532506	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.0978239098594	First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.0733498948059	... and I'd like to respond.
0.0	0.654270835953	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.132654476049	By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job.
0.0	0.0224585858563	I don't need the rhetoric.
0.0	0.256920402319	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.39669454228	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.330540530125	He invoked mine as well.
0.0	0.061907185233	I'll say this.
0.0	0.733584596856	My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.
0.0	0.260714642247	And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.
0.0	0.208203153135	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.36749330243	But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it.
0.0	0.805659510929	We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations.
0.0	0.0561812491774	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.27016359717	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.219424329763	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.356892636717	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.510747220511	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.411128133677	We have more people in jail today than any other country on earth.
0.0	0.375119683895	So I believe that over the next few years, not tomorrow, but over the next few years, we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.260970996845	He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing?
0.0	0.604325492777	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.123248073213	How does that help us?  TRUMP R 15 94 1 N Where is that good?
0.0	0.0702601404213	We've got to build a coalition abroad.
0.0	0.191637130089	What should we do?
0.0	0.37484269016	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.0884674277887	My point is this.
0.0	0.230132780776	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.390600158216	In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America.
0.0	0.191637130089	But...
0.0	0.191569952074	Yes.
0.0	0.237288444928	Could I just say -- just say this...
0.0	0.0923058729107	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.100881389605	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.249381751202	So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.
0.0	0.156558157591	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.279393261428	We have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as General Dempsey said.
0.0	0.649306192494	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.0684003595781	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.212854166677	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.234597851715	And when he moved on his own people, threatening a massacre, genocide, the Europeans and the Arabs, our allies and partners, did ask for American help and we provided it.
0.0	0.663923077376	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.299673499715	They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe.
0.0	0.0609139063345	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.0932323635369	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.842932034805	So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.
0.0	0.391318978728	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.218454729225	Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.370010720696	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.318461556551	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.102496659598	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
1.0	0.999999999895	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.272328528775	Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.0634946907956	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.382152092097	I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.459922868657	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.028348231583	I tell you that.
0.0	0.191569952074	Yes.
0.0	0.222123260326	Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.
1.0	0.997283032304	They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.
0.0	0.00223460765799	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.19341396404	Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.
0.0	0.758630910406	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.980966111651	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.766982443906	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.209226086532	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.467676567882	It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.
0.0	0.520251625017	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.310204144874	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.404169346545	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.0853333056882	You just want to...
0.0	0.121002946799	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.372951092133	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.397533890496	And a lot of people are doing that.
0.0	0.173354135912	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.197296746135	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.0827897919968	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.132213696167	And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage.
0.0	0.354908208011	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.237216625519	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.057281359676	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.260638403986	Common Core should -- it is a disaster.
0.0	0.662374594396	Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.
0.0	0.0473377487653	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.203926859742	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.0106744647219	I will do that.
0.0	0.24597341209	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.520125862811	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
0.0	0.250414285854	We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.
0.0	0.14101027255	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.339754857244	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.303809531807	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.922891950204	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.259524829564	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
1.0	0.999999999081	Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.
0.0	0.274375303661	Everybody thought the deal was dead.
0.0	0.0282932475323	There's give and take.

0.0	0.480485964898	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.664151434444	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
1.0	0.960691331845	The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.
0.0	0.0667656737816	Yeah.

0.0	0.521141930077	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.716202822748	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.152318786232	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.259522156446	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.0924153584283	That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.
0.0	0.356869368586	... first of all...
0.0	0.990638518241	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.177977717462	Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging.
0.0	0.203175208122	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.0706684934436	We will do very, very well, very, very well.
0.0	0.407616245087	It's a country in which people choose to buy guns.
0.0	0.138646270927	But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.
0.0	0.19663037079	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.00520006412935	No, you weren't.
0.0	0.0615852657518	And you know what?
0.0	0.138966221255	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.037642053167	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.0158166793207	No, I think they won't.
0.0	0.364981989828	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.0812406996323	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.102600853019	John, may I -- may I interject here?
0.0	0.160818814639	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...
0.0	0.0438536645779	Excuse me, no.
0.0	0.0615852657518	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.29556575692	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.302306641011	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.0845140264674	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.24309887575	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.191637130089	So what do we do?
0.0	0.540700723066	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
0.0	0.114496215194	Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.213366047266	I'm really rich.
0.0	0.119378838094	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.105551911145	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.260537685651	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.140752148361	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
0.0	0.0235916013212	We have losers.
0.0	0.107504382959	I think we all support it.
0.0	0.319796188331	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.629205166261	Get rid of the fraud.
0.0	0.783800506238	It is not because of the tax writeoff.
0.0	0.0304973894605	I don't have to brag.
0.0	0.153112869072	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.439155735379	and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States.
0.0	0.118128564329	You get a lot of them that are overrated.
0.0	0.167415369905	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.
0.0	0.712581218645	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.117861451462	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.141055189845	You cannot grant amnesty.
0.0	0.338002315776	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.090223965002	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.288558816105	So was I, John.
0.0	0.214649544917	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
1.0	0.984709568847	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
0.0	0.168940669051	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.2401932143	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.180264618142	As governor, we continued to work together.
0.0	0.425975162071	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.210547035822	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.0752411567828	Well, I did.
0.0	0.127234262185	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.656757978688	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.111334394677	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.586415186072	We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.
0.0	0.078274969155	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.654086120524	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.0528702813776	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.134179454655	But I...
0.0	0.51622044213	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.102882509262	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.216482076859	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.116073930974	We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground.
0.0	0.624908579223	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.0385947927738	OK?
0.0	0.396386461352	So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income.
0.0	0.203287462499	You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.
0.0	0.6762992083	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.191374447069	Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves.
0.0	0.478369172346	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.492052182583	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.337344412393	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.104193571723	And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it.
0.0	0.722947634328	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.340123221883	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.181151627902	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.283921787115	And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump," and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns.
0.0	0.583538638603	If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.
0.0	0.112768493131	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.00494416407349	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.432277730879	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.806701791562	Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.
0.0	0.26621096393	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.317567449641	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.440543998729	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.236404913168	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.233456077491	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.078625777566	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.
0.0	0.184903466898	A brief response.
0.0	0.157841480463	The troops on the ground should not be American troops.
0.0	0.217292303796	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.112219183498	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.0104038210056	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.291044301726	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.312363897954	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.533829195774	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.0603188287228	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.33754219188	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.191637130089	But...
0.0	0.340679859062	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.0946859993097	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.177483629601	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.126270450741	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.
0.0	0.157261156138	I said, "Very interesting."
0.0	0.130906297426	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.461371493232	We both made the identical promises.
0.0	0.189741690865	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
0.0	0.292822496777	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.289365909688	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.5	We have fought, as Democrats, for decades to get a health care plan.
0.0	0.19335437699	We now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act, and I don't think we should have to be defending it among Democrats.
0.0	0.160403559164	We also have to build a coalition at home.
0.0	0.864106640284	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.3394810175	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.371030536241	When those buildings came down, she was trapped in her building and I didn't hear from her over six hours.
0.0	0.369341069052	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.187710140535	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
0.0	0.454407159926	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.12944528232	Obama is going to be out playing golf.
0.0	0.206675985786	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.0904756821374	I'm going to be independent.
0.0	0.213616813972	That's the secondary issue.
0.0	0.642062508923	I hire people, they do a Web site.
0.0	0.141400247783	We now finally are where we need to be.
0.0	0.522394276408	Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it.
0.0	0.0865189397007	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.86917438324	All through the recession, we defended the highest median income in America and the second highest median income for African American families.
0.0	0.2104810594	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.353937690508	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.180281433255	You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well.
0.0	0.163795185732	I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.
0.0	0.139876304345	Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.
0.0	0.089949678376	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.186603584023	... not everybody else.
0.0	0.215704279455	We have people that aren't smart.
0.0	0.207528817779	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.
0.0	0.171523993736	I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.
0.0	0.0814335206804	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.0890592096363	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.
0.0	0.10606582001	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.572890358877	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.632144959094	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.0209105440199	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.
0.0	0.0839036876292	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.369601187941	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.0837723564132	They don't even have a chance.
0.0	0.261503002932	As president, I would make the administrator of USAID an actual cabinet member.
0.0	0.191637130089	No.
0.0	0.258452770935	We didn't win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America.
0.0	0.187121339251	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.299994067288	You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.
0.0	0.280734430547	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.14317102506	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
0.0	0.167338904278	Bill after coming home from Japan, flying 33 missions.
0.0	0.517828957823	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.115889632667	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.196916381941	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.328514866516	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.348847798373	Thank you very much.
1.0	0.977751001549	And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.
0.0	0.0724015903122	Thank you.
0.0	0.419739357783	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.389583871362	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.769068100874	Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care.
0.0	0.289291728569	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
0.0	0.191637130089	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.278351118015	And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
0.0	0.236090647093	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.382464807875	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.136851239989	And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.
0.0	0.143107738825	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.6723252042	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.663595276224	Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.
0.0	0.075360322482	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
0.0	0.224821298423	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.679745630504	What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.366593928449	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.10329370854	They went to the DNC quietly.
0.0	0.133576791046	That's just media stuff.
1.0	0.954152019778	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.895196426732	We're spending over $600 billion a year on the military and yet, significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism.
0.0	0.13895248727	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.553971628126	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.976799271977	We defended the highest median income in the country.
0.0	0.0840694167972	But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here.
0.0	0.54795172076	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.336025723139	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.571274498468	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.818746465771	Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.
0.0	0.176817283792	Ask Boeing.
0.0	0.212551272223	And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country.
0.0	0.221491613762	... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
0.0	0.46723101763	It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
0.0	0.253944312662	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.0740104013405	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.191637130089	No.
0.0	0.197585301458	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.216764078081	And there is a lot we can do in college affordability.
0.0	0.405807645594	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.727243533483	It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested.
0.0	0.0419532228892	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
0.0	0.447915211067	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.649528034434	What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people.
0.0	0.145227357554	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.120539667415	And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.
0.0	0.14874756093	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.380899757544	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.296914981304	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.00568144210702	And we are not England.
0.0	0.0822877218232	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
0.0	0.0372602356097	He didn't know.
0.0	0.135174789378	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
0.0	0.105658857771	They're not so stupid.
0.0	0.318630753879	Now, you'd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me?
0.0	0.25033140369	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.544067758134	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.104730294576	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.169632033312	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
1.0	0.753708972422	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.255493783647	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.61535004519	And also -- also, what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health care outcomes are not necessarily that good.
0.0	0.027639316466	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.133400540221	What a brilliant idea that would be.
0.0	0.465512087914	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.252581393801	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.356109964569	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.11346844553	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.601871469029	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.050084680216	That's right.
0.0	0.21630747502	Well, thank you.
0.0	0.0191270567056	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.0179500808689	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.0471382358004	You count on it.
0.0	0.647924671718	Bill.
0.0	0.102008006649	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.0770179070456	We're ready to start shooting."
0.0	0.541925409314	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.00223460765799	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.911114562682	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.203047603445	She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.269892696978	So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
1.0	0.748089548566	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.0615852657518	How do I know this?
0.0	0.0849233692126	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.385877600757	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.0872127231755	They don't know if it worked.
1.0	0.563933977339	Today, we have about 4,000.
0.0	0.578356389273	But bottom line now, is in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or her family.
0.0	0.18645262171	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.069785294771	It didn't have the votes to pass.
0.0	0.0541097576092	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.133933289002	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.384657043609	If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out.
0.0	0.0428750638594	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
1.0	0.231448589506	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.405481161397	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.046668487732	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.346850691036	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.
0.0	0.0965112407121	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.300648033134	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.548101100722	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.
0.0	0.198808529985	From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made.
0.0	0.45529866004	So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years -- you know, we're at $8 trillion now.
0.0	0.0910142305981	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.42705227312	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.176488652068	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.336698532505	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.0613710978661	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.222919552465	My patients are beside themselves.
0.0	0.238528213407	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.313510455491	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.21480547049	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.0480602572655	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.
0.0	0.334864878309	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.0608407046416	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.0346199244265	And I'm confident we can do that.
0.0	0.301032010567	And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.
0.0	0.580981791671	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.588871637048	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.177799435931	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.300562648511	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.124324336604	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.127108581838	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.0681592841259	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.262973492601	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.245259788993	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.216617486455	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.44787381427	So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.
1.0	0.997022016368	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.301676214323	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.0226435961028	I love China.
0.0	0.627264061046	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.191637130089	It is.
0.0	0.01792647217	Chris, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.103365916677	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.273787497361	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.634973958164	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.258330565142	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.357249121941	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.0846052398917	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.0462722624155	It's hate action.
0.0	0.171294941744	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.172497725232	But I guess the final thing that -- that I would say is this is the kind of debate we need to take to the Republicans in the fall.
0.0	0.183484214436	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.057752962875	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.247484143981	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.432554457547	They don't want to raise the minimum wage, they don't want to do anything to increase incomes.
0.0	0.136561395991	They're saying, "Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough."
0.0	0.644776801546	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.236813661767	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.274005764326	Sit down with people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the house, and work on a bill.
0.0	0.450142048948	... we have the tools in federal law to do this now.
0.0	0.0164578213669	And we're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.409093376182	For a start, they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes.
0.0	0.048854919512	We got it.
0.0	0.109639575643	When I'm president, that will change.
0.0	0.191637130089	No, I have not.
0.0	0.275042548603	And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.
0.0	0.191637130089	...
0.0	0.876340891328	They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care.
0.0	0.231359862408	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.258193216429	I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that's what Iowans like to do.
0.0	0.0663790082271	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.103597408343	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.165849342249	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.260818507201	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.187140413243	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.184038149244	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.511275675523	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
0.0	0.094197310352	As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
0.0	0.853669428866	Who denies that it is crazy...
0.0	0.270201506465	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.228508541549	So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
0.0	0.797850757814	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.369593841347	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.191637130089	That's what it is.
0.0	0.338712678149	It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.
0.0	0.798486911328	He has never defended...
0.0	0.209440538102	Kevin, if I could just jump in.
0.0	0.166717922553	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.0339586677982	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.528911351925	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.316623932314	If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
0.0	0.0741667464885	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.
0.0	0.0773382896488	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.320755268153	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.171805953095	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.
0.0	0.0750480581523	That's what really matters.
0.0	0.191637130089	Why?
0.0	0.511556695692	They're a scam.
0.0	0.396327171876	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
1.0	0.258788429018	And the overall message is that it doesn't result in job loss.
0.0	0.0404280493916	A step forward.
0.0	0.169747139138	And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.
0.0	0.113330610967	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
1.0	0.999999987266	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.0714562195854	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.480007361609	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.0226435961028	I love China.
0.0	0.151047558707	I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.169938705333	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.178552007558	Well, you've got to be on top of it right away.
0.0	0.578563517744	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.182612921548	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
1.0	0.119814651582	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.0695058842147	Came out great.
0.0	0.27726334494	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.142939343689	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.
0.0	0.346831289692	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.10363302871	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.
0.0	0.13368206781	We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression.
0.0	0.166267087629	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.996862519827	So the total is $8,737,540,00.
0.0	0.191637130089	No.
0.0	0.109440869979	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.
0.0	0.411812664591	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.0579077015196	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.560062108274	They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
