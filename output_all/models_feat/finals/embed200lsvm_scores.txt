0.0	0.292896657823	You know, Ted didn't show up.
0.0	0.465173921403	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.459412904911	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.421022629361	And that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity -- kill people who are unarmed who should not be killed, they must be held accountable.
0.0	0.387474959979	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.337544747783	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.361117660122	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.403827288206	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.272683474627	So Hillary and I have a difference.
0.0	0.340974588343	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.262956043306	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.437714022531	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.347434477673	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.336115220949	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.
0.0	0.0	May I respond?
0.0	0.391251893327	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.310289085042	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.
0.0	0.328963361542	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.450774736678	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.415121924731	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
0.0	0.429170176044	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.275413259491	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.436932029815	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.402927205907	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.223245816811	I'm going to tell you -- thank you.
0.0	0.285725932948	They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.
0.0	0.409921253808	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.432824837923	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.377531768517	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.453203937025	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.267628928081	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.394679477497	And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young, old, everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard.
0.0	0.354893401755	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.37789791063	Al Qaida was based in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.312427005933	You bet they do.
0.0	0.337874742452	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.0	All right.
0.0	0.392334436521	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.33699887735	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.274170723327	I don't like that.
0.0	0.292369029884	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.398226999516	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.309469567934	And the answer is: Because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda.
0.0	0.296981305768	We listen to you and -- and then we act.
0.0	0.314010062307	slot.
0.0	0.387140155666	Very valuable.
0.0	0.350081513819	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.335417880476	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.429184753703	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.371046232152	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.394188191138	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.345113308275	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.39782136739	We bailed out Wall Street.
0.0	0.397294736393	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.26151789691	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.34101763652	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.393739924273	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.437464392605	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.0	I would just...
0.0	0.261443268812	And God bless America.
0.0	0.335486512177	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.364092785754	They had a plan that was good.
0.0	0.420773957599	We are already de-conflicting air space.
0.0	0.310291584908	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.370975439855	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.396330419749	When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.457114247915	Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place.
0.0	0.413883966756	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.378446955396	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.423124580448	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.370440673476	And we should be a welcoming nation.
0.0	0.300649422553	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.345381797901	But they're killing us economically.
0.0	0.429524688303	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
0.0	0.372845262653	That's the future of banking in America.
0.0	0.437039193042	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.379005941583	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.339041263013	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.211536478948	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.395993692705	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.326572860651	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.403842758157	I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.
0.0	0.163232524188	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.411475141287	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.273540619146	The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.
0.0	0.347036406481	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.292190809683	There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better.
0.0	0.343487780084	... and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.0	Again...
0.0	0.192587808709	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.247693297461	Don't know that.
0.0	0.237749210351	I've gotta do it."
0.0	0.387014194157	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.414952029768	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.344041048388	We've been at this a couple of years.
0.0	0.301676347401	We're dying.
0.0	0.429295226613	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.430142386075	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.306146596443	But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that.
0.0	0.312931150201	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.379430555138	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.41038904606	When he brought forward the "Gang of Eight" bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.
0.0	0.424960579111	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
0.0	0.352368109302	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.
1.0	0.351466674949	I think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street...
0.0	0.447436101363	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.429858904317	I watched the video of Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.294479897626	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.260474877095	We all understand that.
0.0	0.252208562648	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.245374743915	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.311778140487	... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message.
1.0	0.610744641943	A $5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.388070310431	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.356662947377	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
0.0	0.436688890821	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.354260866613	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.0	No, he doesn't.
1.0	0.642106074369	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
0.0	0.319877247489	That's the difference.
0.0	0.27033735154	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.363288174164	We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.
0.0	0.291629967815	it won't happen.
0.0	0.568968104883	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.322397810251	And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them.
0.0	0.3321971252	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.396553002685	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.328522257321	I would like to see it updated.
0.0	0.24759466601	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.509483425479	Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.
0.0	0.319089194956	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.319518331286	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.47080380152	I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains.
0.0	0.412401570297	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.293608716154	It cannot solely be America's fight.
0.0	0.381721647817	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.429807075152	We got it done in my state by leading with principal and that's what we need to do as a party for comprehensive gun safety.
0.0	0.389568544032	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.346657726305	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.
0.0	0.45497236448	We have to do away with the strawman proposal.
0.0	0.421457318102	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.345498884114	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.36922276403	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
0.0	0.433131355361	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
0.0	0.410760015327	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.41232610398	That means education.
0.0	0.376115144434	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.379115606021	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.498070487292	No hour is too short, no dollar too small.
0.0	0.503626756643	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.385458626971	And, also, acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration, and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners.
0.0	0.355582332965	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.33682726778	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.367634945835	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.322573690351	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.456985274847	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.473242431045	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.420250443827	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.352335718633	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.261654891277	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.403544081045	I think we need major reform in the military, making it more cost effective, but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us.
0.0	0.412595424276	I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
0.0	0.301810627063	Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.
0.0	0.235201694412	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.395629909372	Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice.
0.0	0.0	Yeah.
0.0	0.546900161298	Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.439300812546	For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check.
0.0	0.450556143245	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.411409380127	And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that.
0.0	0.34599402108	I started off -- thank you -- I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said -- and I love my father.
0.0	0.38854869661	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.379355115469	So I believe that, in fact, this country needs to move towards a living wage.
0.0	0.382883968777	... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before.
0.0	0.371310593639	That's the job.
0.0	0.406028509755	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
0.0	0.369112384876	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.416215116525	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.276387835801	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.390368664502	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.352917802942	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.483409906996	But at the end of the day, what you have right now are millions of Americans working two or three jobs because their wages that they are earning are just too low.
0.0	0.385860385276	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.397141306093	Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day.
0.0	0.387165460021	We should be supportive of that effort.
0.0	0.179993148508	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.0	That's not right.
0.0	0.382875888817	And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.
0.0	0.270447254831	I said, "I don't need it.
0.0	0.36227127748	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.432291024894	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.340383128444	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.422996311385	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
0.0	0.238102605962	We get a traitor.
0.0	0.463719533385	And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.
0.0	0.347380931827	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.365278086314	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.

0.0	0.530728240008	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
1.0	0.402183727356	We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people.

0.0	0.357084203939	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.364820572029	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.352565171623	Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare?

0.0	0.385636386404	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.452541418827	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.

0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.245907160065	You find me...

0.0	0.314567993654	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.320340509427	The Secretary's obviously right.
0.0	0.312505322405	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.320761014308	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.

0.0	0.345310782279	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.295920356548	I've had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say, I don't agree with you on everything, but I like what you do.
0.0	0.482270521981	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.

0.0	0.296595026469	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.361746438574	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.

0.0	0.36069705702	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.319948689033	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
1.0	0.662716299426	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
0.0	0.555035565646	But the poll numbers have.
1.0	0.457413554125	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.4174201951	You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet...
0.0	0.436139064117	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.36640272233	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.37962472057	As Americans, we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet, but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies, to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability.
0.0	0.26759238938	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.436927633231	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.342443895068	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.354304184812	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.360253822852	I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria.
0.0	0.25404248909	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.278195328004	What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.
0.0	0.410108787288	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.369327873496	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.529320222467	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.338942986144	We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be -- and -- and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody.
0.0	0.445096446115	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.402135145439	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.279511899398	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.360611218319	And what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.463162865107	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.446946241219	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.438894031342	This is an emergency.
0.0	0.592365859863	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.52324868855	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.472462117402	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.275413259491	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.328278444957	And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem.
0.0	0.474324821861	And it has three parts.
0.0	0.456584534682	I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil.
0.0	0.492265364703	We have to end -- education has to be local.
0.0	0.556331905641	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.426414582869	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.428436930943	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.
0.0	0.343831974373	They're killing us.
0.0	0.311255620698	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.394190246487	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.430605450044	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.343987736888	And Abdullah said something recently, very important.
0.0	0.522984321616	Thousands.
0.0	0.413292081602	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.374518631538	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.333319152269	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.407137360171	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.353413512833	And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition, including Russia, to help us destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.29583285322	It's a joke.
0.0	0.412741481257	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.36819967451	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.303927033479	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.430100897371	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.
1.0	0.530829722799	Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.
0.0	0.399995319694	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
1.0	0.635090050439	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.431188575064	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.366727553603	If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.
0.0	0.260486947721	They are not going to go away on their own.
0.0	0.320928996106	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.431037264142	I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
0.0	0.407598106578	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.351723636839	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.438745255832	And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting.
0.0	0.386414445817	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.418896313871	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
0.0	0.40119159121	I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.
0.0	0.251760423718	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.431023194049	And I understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary.
0.0	0.549581975327	Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day.
0.0	0.290705040563	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.
0.0	0.274170723327	They don't like that.
0.0	0.22520594273	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.335125305326	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.21870666051	Oh.
0.0	0.226962197738	Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.
0.0	0.389196892395	Well, you know, governor, I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010.
0.0	0.358542256822	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.269547647478	That is why we need to make...
0.0	0.534779614726	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.459967979633	You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.
0.0	0.0	And guess what?
0.0	0.370829947727	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.358528401287	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.0	You don't have to.
0.0	0.498729777361	Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military.
0.0	0.427115142237	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.414902419456	Marco opposed this because they made a deal.
0.0	0.336373258409	And people are saying, "What's going on?
1.0	0.44611708271	And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent.
0.0	0.301657424777	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.441619103233	It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.
0.0	0.331294527366	They like to ask direct questions.
0.0	0.202662699048	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.321613817542	We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?
0.0	0.47976074144	Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server.
0.0	0.337868358778	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.313578980565	We saw that in Egypt.
0.0	0.520344667552	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.463765758821	But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
0.0	0.443789540979	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.32340919133	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.447131040974	John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.
0.0	0.372756057065	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.406140356556	They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
0.0	0.362621822534	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.52545492359	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.414321092857	That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable.
0.0	0.330273470625	I think this is a very difficult issue.
0.0	0.372160100571	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.429861979098	But I have another one, Ford.
0.0	0.313367376305	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
1.0	0.288455994065	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.321944928408	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.284411003309	I like it.
0.0	0.294040541743	They were wrong.
0.0	0.0	Yeah.
0.0	0.510447459332	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.327816820952	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.402826335443	But I would add this.
0.0	0.307333424205	We can build the fence.
0.0	0.376301503659	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.405189591226	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.475964967717	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.579595267233	You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent.
0.0	0.287277802353	You learn that threats always change.
0.0	0.474861774845	I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.
0.0	0.361500872903	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.398856679663	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.2848355261	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.335487661928	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.0	So...
0.0	0.401918327828	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.394008695305	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.429074173384	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.271169432143	I think I'm actually a very nice person."
0.0	0.308835566159	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.25817034422	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.295233540752	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.
0.0	0.325178200757	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.480709223223	That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.433323160293	They're controlled fully -- they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
0.0	0.255934193697	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.326079380728	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.426602380947	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.376223897116	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.413667319237	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.335375038603	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.333853960425	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.390708723515	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.434246773505	When was the last time you heard China is killing us?
0.0	0.421807342294	May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care?
0.0	0.31701388997	Well, I just want to quickly add...
0.0	0.420103288249	Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable?
0.0	0.2697534087	We have the opposite thinking.
0.0	0.363000380296	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.438681739643	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.320308128939	Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.
0.0	0.314086304268	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.363744996052	But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector.
1.0	0.713400717837	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.312702933476	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.504437745455	The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.614227091296	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.489182055123	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.494812955117	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.392337130985	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.
0.0	0.317833341819	Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate.
0.0	0.389808517646	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.407239062319	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.583250662901	And remember the $5 billion Web site?
0.0	0.393769354105	All of these are very difficult issues.
0.0	0.303964199957	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.319621721889	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
0.0	0.344450014892	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.376004316094	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.320168413759	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.33798561015	Well, thanks for having me.
0.0	0.422182399881	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.362261034927	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.420915639129	Bottom line.
1.0	0.445457440911	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.513363062935	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.211479079157	We need that thinking.
0.0	0.274501785826	What have you got now?
0.0	0.373624100429	I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.
0.0	0.0	You do.
0.0	0.327922214958	We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
0.0	0.389006778	And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world.
0.0	0.418064889666	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.352779226299	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.178663345092	See?
0.0	0.422028045274	As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.
0.0	0.3209955348	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.328455296409	Marco, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.378608884654	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.345146022009	I don't get any money from Wall Street.
0.0	0.214118377885	Wait for what?
0.0	0.250679091913	We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
0.0	0.372422017325	I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.
0.0	0.398327244725	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.436072230951	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.32815855591	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.396720120488	I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.
0.0	0.298319460061	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
0.0	0.420574643801	My oldest daughter's a teacher.
1.0	0.578009587867	I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.
0.0	0.385645784271	When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.
0.0	0.418651581322	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.436066284882	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.395457128955	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.340023008081	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.520427603216	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.321445602316	But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said.
0.0	0.390795508171	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.278542459143	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.338275554325	Dynamically.
0.0	0.267934382101	But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.
0.0	0.277805867044	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.377322300279	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.424938132719	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.336058035752	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.554553769384	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.301733578212	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.38761749424	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.368490076818	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.310012767771	We needed 60.
0.0	0.425872581357	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.335862898359	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.44467203463	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.453036233074	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.48204997272	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.275553801013	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.414092414909	White people?
0.0	0.328124619087	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.443164915994	There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction.
0.0	0.284080731277	I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs.
0.0	0.396677387225	It's not just Wall Street.
0.0	0.411695548884	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.343662315886	And there are many ways of doing it.
1.0	0.294507516865	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
1.0	0.66179554818	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.500156713913	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.393356667785	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.36032586265	They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it."
0.0	0.253269840179	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.310851238971	John.
0.0	0.405651025701	Check it out.
0.0	0.455362659275	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.417796685427	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.402040600003	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.
0.0	0.320516468324	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.328963960615	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.
0.0	0.0	That's right.
0.0	0.324753149358	We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.
0.0	0.363563352907	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.31851221765	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.413105968551	Saudi Arabia without us is gone.
0.0	0.262009726122	So I've watched the politicians.
0.0	0.395452338216	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.457313361637	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.482204842622	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.402754933817	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.360560900847	I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.
0.0	0.464167504693	And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.
0.0	0.629502494441	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
1.0	0.624745195527	And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.
0.0	0.383119836438	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.526214715175	We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government.
0.0	0.412612596955	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.379034533304	We can have debt-free college in the United States.
0.0	0.40402943113	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.
0.0	0.429152905017	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.358563317012	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.412797131118	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.337024252488	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.478182273211	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.354048178179	Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.
0.0	0.289714085064	Let me just -- let me just...
0.0	0.401181434885	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.375347088769	I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace.
0.0	0.189938705339	Please go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.403241517034	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.406323088599	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.0	You know that.
0.0	0.425139098613	... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.304010550987	We need to figure this out together.
0.0	0.382958184126	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.347413652272	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.40465480629	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.544544347729	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.317725747457	But it will be...
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.420205951459	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.35736927225	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.448101812156	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.396841763289	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.344993427132	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.269097144033	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.554369948084	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.23940657393	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.369639433451	There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out.
0.0	0.270731004698	Chris?
0.0	0.318332505791	And look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that.
0.0	0.448634827568	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.276465930997	You know, I've always had a great deal of respect.
0.0	0.381373408446	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.440082573125	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.370497809316	And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.
0.0	0.452498295626	You do legislation.
0.0	0.409478107216	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.361918767446	And some, I assume, are good people.
0.0	0.584297430499	We increased education funding by 37 percent.
0.0	0.422606862386	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.393991469815	But states need to do more as well.
0.0	0.414433753763	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.513759653746	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
0.0	0.380848661297	We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.302316408798	They are going to have to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.400711121846	They can't even answer simple questions.
0.0	0.346908073059	They started in Iowa.
0.0	0.305116056037	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.281786969125	I won't be doing that.
0.0	0.261283900672	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.37958559141	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.0	I know.
0.0	0.319401366658	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.352521894732	We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.
0.0	0.444917527156	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.274637482199	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.309492448737	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.354488989672	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.0	OK.
0.0	0.369740198573	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.0	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.362243400361	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.363127201171	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.455899586872	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.353585462754	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.337685397213	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.433985186202	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.0	No, I don't think so.
0.0	0.284026532183	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.495968740355	It had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.348082930965	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.402633633223	There's too much -- it's like -- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
0.0	0.369584116499	You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911.
0.0	0.421873838018	We overcame the NRA's objections.
0.0	0.40432998341	He's actually a negative force.
0.0	0.418253060063	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.33770388425	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.423918830903	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.498094877388	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.307451498894	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.558215752409	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.244329851684	And I -- I thought, if I didn't jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this.
0.0	0.419704374496	Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, "Rand, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.394051964499	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.389768998761	We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party.
0.0	0.395278723025	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.429696804945	That's a drag on the economy.
0.0	0.333331400022	And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.
0.0	0.294926447728	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.359922141789	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.
0.0	0.338036780026	How are these people gonna lead us?
0.0	0.402496489563	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.350029134681	At the same time we're doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform.
0.0	0.429471485174	Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values.
0.0	0.404028395822	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.505037074979	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.3697488879	And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.
0.0	0.0	Megyn?
0.0	0.390468182843	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.361439915469	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.330614043357	The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.384161454186	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.345580091759	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.387154822025	You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes.
0.0	0.564957613292	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.329423869928	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.384908053343	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.402832269984	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.316200662683	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.364407554403	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.360723928498	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.36422011421	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.417592671803	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
0.0	0.373063330873	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.337425734918	Let's put the gun makers and sellers on notice that they're not going to get away with it.
0.0	0.431026754513	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
1.0	0.658372711153	Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?
0.0	0.357540426125	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.519271092122	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.361710829273	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.328939412872	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.409823056627	So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out.
0.0	0.370242337259	But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.
0.0	0.387567097166	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
0.0	0.402758759582	We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended.
0.0	0.403609390002	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.393221850866	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.
0.0	0.487028755171	Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.
0.0	0.397758989643	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.419351847579	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.344338033616	They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America.
0.0	0.336454794176	And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.
0.0	0.351631330094	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.371525856559	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.341663305847	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.213785467859	It's not great again.
0.0	0.444137772979	I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
0.0	0.294431669795	We have got to come forward with a consensus that in fact will work.
0.0	0.486906128556	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.522617022804	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
0.0	0.320551588327	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.245756638586	And it has been amazing to me.
0.0	0.220307683895	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.416151948197	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.445200038069	At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.
0.0	0.339898030374	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.312766499514	You don't serve us.
0.0	0.346922527548	Give people a chance.
0.0	0.440498630726	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.286202050295	You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches.
0.0	0.388229496208	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.33792900883	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.351994908612	I mean, my dad went to college on a G.I.
0.0	0.372270187004	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.305619014125	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.0	But...
0.0	0.403849277996	I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.
0.0	0.318586563055	I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.
0.0	0.332168278701	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.197646080155	And that's what's happening.
0.0	0.302980412147	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.42055929835	But it was also the cascading effects that followed that.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.0	Why is that?
0.0	0.372378019774	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.443749987693	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.37209395441	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.404945951092	Are you not running?
0.0	0.310851238971	John?
0.0	0.378416617439	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.356100486667	I've prosecuted terrorists.
0.0	0.449588562006	Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors.
0.0	0.445603713029	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.188899894169	So be very, very careful.
0.0	0.252878075987	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.419153914438	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.391763831454	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.320316635666	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.388364325878	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.361052667714	I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party's nominee.
0.0	0.38969562501	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.385186141112	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.350349680198	We went after those who had attacked us.
0.0	0.458082021897	I've employed -- I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
0.0	0.328341753468	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.35283834536	... And start taking advice...
0.0	0.321840029909	You have a bigger problem with China.
0.0	0.0	And guess what?
0.0	0.300473682183	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.314614273897	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.310833239804	When we put money into the hands of working people, they're going to go out and buy goods, they're going to buy services and they're going to create jobs in doing that.
0.0	0.380157245373	Of course the United States must lead.
0.0	0.329106481975	I like Marco Rubio.
1.0	0.718480462349	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.449031513465	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.441196525049	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.32509019457	That is a pledge that I'm making.
0.0	0.31015474946	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.338942036335	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.383574962027	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.463642329982	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.2200319779	Can you believe this?
0.0	0.404700989791	Number two, we had a really good plan.
0.0	0.421479656936	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.264371137767	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.328837878573	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.371034834838	When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.
0.0	0.370136037842	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.335918587122	Look at my family.
0.0	0.371485189493	And, here's what she said to the American people.
0.0	0.397265274251	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.338272755566	Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
0.0	0.598994476541	But you would index it -- you would index it to the median wage.
0.0	0.446666098036	I -- you know, know that Senator Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers.
0.0	0.359231034925	Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin.
0.0	0.258469602529	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.47260935844	It's virtually useless.
0.0	0.260207691874	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.379702313018	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.400310576615	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.626091180156	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.203392172603	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.434932181744	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.413169662469	I think it's fair to say that Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America, but the issue is...
0.0	0.361883794985	Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope.
0.0	0.160392106559	I'm ready.
0.0	0.19754693708	Now I'm not doing that...I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?
0.0	0.486146973531	Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.338236021057	I mean, that's a fact.
0.0	0.29027828727	Can I just say this...
0.0	0.428401964346	ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.
0.0	0.378139034149	So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act.
0.0	0.34949274119	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.460492048006	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
1.0	0.653475503622	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.325231387051	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.30440714421	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.0	That is...
0.0	0.38697737813	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.378082047433	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.274482698125	I said, "I don't know."
0.0	0.413807841305	And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty.
0.0	0.439879384709	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.388294434252	And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party, but of President Obama.
0.0	0.382987100858	And I was determined to do everything that I could to make VA health care the best in the world, to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending.
0.0	0.29539061548	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.320340488233	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.39417166386	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.33744991075	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.388001501285	First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.
0.0	0.330869103426	How can you get people to vote for you?"
0.0	0.512117575192	You have all of these disastrous airports.
0.0	0.267810749424	So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.
0.0	0.409840046635	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.388109149293	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.389023603053	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.341677485601	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.452908154755	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.288695731405	We can't.
0.0	0.376526338574	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.377459405831	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.389408091246	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
0.0	0.301730126259	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.356676925213	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.291989310262	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.33826806558	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.342745121372	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.369073037952	It all will be scrutinized.
0.0	0.344453292959	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.354803967849	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.274252870605	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.371387590016	Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that's not good enough.
0.0	0.403747697297	There are no simple solutions.
0.0	0.438838443822	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.305625964585	Becky --
0.0	0.300259336524	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.365120477247	Your prosecute criminals.
1.0	0.461909584774	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.376333686077	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.376010784712	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.411805441804	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.483129765057	We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally.
0.0	0.415531582783	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.311999383708	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.375785668507	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.0	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.366390764833	All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.
0.0	0.350370307068	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.471694216509	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.334614812291	We'll be filing it right on time.
0.0	0.371334918537	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.539591857608	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.369644499547	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
0.0	0.343041475584	We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear.
0.0	0.497158731003	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.361711085395	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.319280797892	We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.
0.0	0.25960120166	He can't have it both ways.
0.0	0.402464788703	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.
0.0	0.344839231395	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.351860747769	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.209110042792	they expect to get something.
0.0	0.343381058368	But this is what we also have to say.
0.0	0.21255037891	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.372759654941	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.418983683772	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.611966052845	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.56687652667	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.404844372707	And he asked me to support that.
0.0	0.397198676562	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.240639377262	You're right.
0.0	0.343454191472	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.365136445842	Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.304051521891	... Well, no, no.
0.0	0.396978887911	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.431377343626	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.178851258805	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.247961959353	Now I want to go back something.
0.0	0.504039061463	There's no nation on earth that comes close to that number.
0.0	0.364265300973	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.345300902038	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.355408269322	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.270108838076	David...
0.0	0.468434692533	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
0.0	0.349971017132	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.478392255862	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.291695671782	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.28553662509	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.351367495579	Number one, we're going to keep ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.403042770569	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.387883037695	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
1.0	0.478958254662	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.36141660139	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.295075408919	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.354990349913	Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.
0.0	0.356925220725	So, yes, this has developed.
0.0	0.430382532468	We haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.
0.0	0.445050569637	According to the economists -- who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying -- that $24 trillion -- we're very close -- that's the point of no return.
0.0	0.391805050675	So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.
0.0	0.251687231683	We don't need that.
0.0	0.285446962355	But you don't hear that from anybody else.
0.0	0.454113561124	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.439678743844	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.512824074238	I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.314559548922	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.347445781943	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.278143241255	We must anticipate these threats before they happen.
0.0	0.326149820924	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.256223211864	Reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.368050761438	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.430231254707	My plan is there.
0.0	0.403797111686	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.316597496506	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.368820434922	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
1.0	0.639266949049	That's wrong.
0.0	0.289714085064	Let me just...
0.0	0.330611111671	... against Islam -- radical Islam -- if you're not for border security.
0.0	0.301543399579	We don't win.
0.0	0.351979474503	Listen, we can solve immigration.
0.0	0.528764988939	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.448383167544	Illegal.
0.0	0.312417155509	So did you, Marco.
0.0	0.38482358666	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.483854753632	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.458716090268	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.476928674402	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.38926157904	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.360178544569	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.370901929764	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.303514407807	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.419119023527	We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president.
0.0	0.369203525784	Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.
0.0	0.445573068392	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.412628576363	You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?
0.0	0.36190328164	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.420809964344	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.354227780764	We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.
0.0	0.538781793314	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
1.0	0.551366996689	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.298786851674	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.328526653905	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.345035576657	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.422315874556	I am proud that I was the first member of Congress to take Americans over the Canadian border to buy breast cancer drugs for one-tenth the price they were paying in the United States.
0.0	0.369372254879	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
0.0	0.385533047342	We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations.
0.0	0.362217320282	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.420915639129	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.347412888197	We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.
0.0	0.46391123162	Growth is the answer.
0.0	1.0	I never said that.
0.0	0.383372551616	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.328273508544	And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.
0.0	0.294071788893	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.35208546515	And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in.
0.0	0.485487132818	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.320554501999	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.386504190524	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.353884555385	We actually took action to do these things and as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families.
0.0	0.464919573818	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.37094315278	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
0.0	0.436348767283	That is our government today.
0.0	0.380805436912	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.289678005711	We don't need more of the same solutions.
0.0	0.418720303464	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.320824908239	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.0	OK.
0.0	0.367432330498	You know why three?
0.0	0.31196793848	Let's do more -- let's do more than reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.453120480458	I met recently with some members of the Chaldean Christian communities and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months.
0.0	0.476746472389	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.431647636273	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.439479543501	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.337859917968	I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.287125388201	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.298145843149	No, Martha, I would not.
0.0	0.305155314665	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.390910970745	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.382404285026	Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.
0.0	0.390767333593	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.260767157424	...before I go.
0.0	0.361901665123	Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.279224843979	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.0	Not at all.
0.0	0.389243532542	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.213768442883	Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid.
0.0	0.351324987893	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.0	I have...
0.0	0.315817638693	We need to move aggressively now.
0.0	0.213841853643	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.415013625015	But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone.
0.0	0.458837272159	And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.
0.0	0.327065278243	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.302551209341	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.442991371291	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?
0.0	0.352593314633	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.610744641943	$5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.445675509415	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.412041349405	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.222220642357	And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.
0.0	0.386543063012	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.547472171939	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.465101516937	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.462039049579	This ties into campaign finance reform.
0.0	0.380516705744	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.35098094524	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.353046534422	You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.
0.0	0.365223225948	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.277084380661	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.456078560696	We actually passed a living wage.
0.0	0.428520884431	And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.
0.0	0.397015291535	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.289834874455	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.333120953447	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.495204448732	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.375188156106	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.409877146843	It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.352911771838	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.
0.0	0.381377253306	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.320542747922	I win.
0.0	0.401524846623	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.341339561501	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.36019115063	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.397061081388	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.337630047164	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.463767708036	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.204937371029	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.370901929764	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.294040541743	We were wrong.
0.0	0.336388596094	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.446895167769	I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.
0.0	0.379514985605	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.389466483311	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.262227676522	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
1.0	0.437103077811	But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works.
1.0	0.711707578697	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.44921102368	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.261627387192	Can we stop?
0.0	0.389899151496	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.30335471556	We were attacked from Afghanistan.
0.0	0.419425388066	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.388580764398	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.379182672973	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.23228387923	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.411292141633	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.394164876708	Rebuild the country's infrastructure.
0.0	0.247693297461	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.0	Say again?
0.0	0.378173475713	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.198000894724	And he'll say, "Please, please, please."
0.0	0.362052802792	Then, in 2008, you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying that we don't need those regulations on the federal level and now you're coming back around here.
0.0	0.387325744741	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.34677763057	That's not fair.
1.0	0.339240622632	Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.
0.0	0.325162835228	I've laid out...
0.0	0.368582416077	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.
0.0	0.409542789445	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.316919629201	If you want to make it into the middle class -- I'm not saying in all cases -- we need plumbers, and we need carpenters, and electricians, that's for sure, and they should get help as well.
0.0	0.300556417367	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.
0.0	0.404471386653	Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.
0.0	0.387477649618	We saw a dictator overthrown.
0.0	0.500124241434	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.454448995379	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.234371192928	We never dreamt we'd ever see it."
0.0	0.322429147885	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.354364277978	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.177977292773	I'll do it.
0.0	0.390467652027	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.213890606183	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.345287861416	Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name.
0.0	0.428742347369	And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring.
0.0	0.360978148945	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.390654835424	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.302956832826	And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?
0.0	0.367525145194	But I'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya, you would be looking at Syria.
0.0	0.386746205929	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.276631655554	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.50533249489	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.38518308202	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.516822173979	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.354320064154	Many businessmen want to endorse me.

0.0	0.472119972183	And, I would not that there's a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that's the EPA's blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline.
0.0	0.27469568956	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.

0.0	0.367243437547	I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena.
0.0	0.317030209262	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.479742767797	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.329070690499	We offered a lot more.
0.0	0.386158092456	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.261283900672	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.394432470393	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.308892847116	I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary...
0.0	0.455289863232	We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York.
0.0	0.413984224668	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.289913364626	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.471698937027	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.280472369776	They've got nothing but money.
0.0	0.366674259719	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.25715655855	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.546399591981	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.479792592038	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.35230030773	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.360993023488	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.40362823926	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.271695400966	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.280205742879	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.31585038435	I don't care.
0.0	0.371399595761	That's what I understand is the request from the international...
0.0	0.3413313998	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
1.0	0.496161763292	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
1.0	0.754917149377	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.298890265739	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.401809904284	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.375546636815	I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support.
0.0	0.261941712427	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.427108517122	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.340564435777	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.0	That's right.
0.0	0.363941176733	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.194952977954	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.372485916614	So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe.
0.0	0.244170407863	I believe we've got to go further.
1.0	0.735101957612	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.351325783706	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
0.0	0.372226626912	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.464815082989	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.305912648889	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
0.0	0.438490671886	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.254762359982	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.237674826029	There are thing that can be done.
0.0	0.48852584662	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.406872137927	So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.
0.0	0.270731004698	...Chris...
0.0	0.334294380446	I'm not using donors.
0.0	0.343526928381	That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.

0.0	0.365534719121	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
1.0	0.699550667871	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.419996418643	They come up to my office.
0.0	0.309760546399	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.443872810815	In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men.
0.0	0.361828032798	And your point is absolutely well taken.
0.0	0.420810004998	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.342394669101	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.420916859027	We are doing both at the same time.
0.0	0.401070077471	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.416721111568	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.392071720643	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.465437595112	Last point.
0.0	0.383684361931	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.299770127603	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.339801262048	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.218472626714	I'm proud of my family.
0.0	0.341990304496	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.300272456052	So nice, thank you very much.
0.0	0.400771929302	And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...
0.0	0.379566212328	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.267069454119	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.429595390665	They are our first line of defense.
0.0	0.405375029857	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.293969172606	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.404639295903	You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization.
0.0	0.426499997104	It's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement.
0.0	0.419649484651	Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees.
0.0	0.0	We haven't.
0.0	0.289206105013	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.393724310204	I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground.
0.0	0.454366661748	It's a disaster.
0.0	0.335355989405	Find out what I said to Greenspan.
0.0	0.305588808697	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.412562913752	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.410612981055	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.451673249719	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.396216906929	And it's impossible for our people here to compete.
0.0	0.403451253369	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.
0.0	0.329778226211	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.37202000478	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.28214156302	They have no choice.
0.0	0.51452453086	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.279950307834	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.498679736354	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.42013451397	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.26909831991	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.348324021746	But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.
0.0	0.409914324153	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.294479897626	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.363975339114	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.333814005554	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
1.0	0.466157392906	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.280089044729	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.464264334524	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
0.0	0.411780058447	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.260584785822	I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work.
0.0	0.350937256129	You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.
0.0	0.327946392794	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.533728201549	Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system.
0.0	0.279749089991	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.371173682523	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.426537920416	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.325568737433	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.471998036078	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.369597138515	The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.
0.0	0.369158714383	And I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern.
0.0	0.405907403587	Our country has tremendous potential.
0.0	0.37029660757	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.295406181098	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.378126217541	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.356028416614	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.352199958794	We have people that aren't working.
0.0	0.472771125205	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.335386125127	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.385729562377	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.431759733089	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.355490126145	I want immigration reform to pass.
0.0	0.346294624692	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.341177015026	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.354186437101	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.
0.0	0.438603989084	That's fine.
0.0	0.460684919252	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.499644073695	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.378454085206	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.313099061622	... and say there is something more important than money.
1.0	0.669164639474	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
0.0	0.364794178333	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.415650597213	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.247693297461	But we don't know.
0.0	0.378603827293	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.336344777477	And Teddy Roosevelt is right.
0.0	0.445171666632	This is not a conflict where we send in the third divisions of Marines.
0.0	0.323618076167	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.392916932845	And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.
0.0	0.362490610434	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.336908537131	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.486439246821	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.281612196291	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.268404432601	We know about the Brits.
1.0	0.5799662114	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.401067069611	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.419814897278	In fact, American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the National Institute of Health and that we then tested through the FDA.
0.0	0.385303884447	The Iranians getting more of a presence in Syria, linking with Hezbollah, their proxy in Lebanon, would threaten Israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with Assad's future.
0.0	0.48589285482	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.311547560443	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.285250772321	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.421523292004	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.394117293975	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.34017730394	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.27590491593	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.321298901971	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.353773303852	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.369080153179	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.301460115911	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.427947627036	And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.
0.0	0.346442930529	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.51425914525	to save a company.
0.0	0.300499903046	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.362903468346	Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.
0.0	0.307317868432	Ted can change his mind.
0.0	0.336577606406	I've been to Ferguson, I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.32013555178	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.429825444036	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
0.0	0.311385277445	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.319787280401	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.435241445679	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.350492234164	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.536005763835	I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.
0.0	0.385792917786	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.445566602963	I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment.
0.0	0.375567314405	Medicare for all, single-payer system is the way we should go.
0.0	0.296406291596	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.415479025452	And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
0.0	0.224203251929	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.444566699956	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.310588326908	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.363109806786	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.397681970614	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
0.0	0.450972696797	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.285402740677	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.377751648239	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.
0.0	0.480659440442	They all have jobs.
0.0	0.345862608495	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.
0.0	0.443282241749	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.357129168397	Donald Trump, for example -- I'm glad -- I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him...
0.0	0.435360797699	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.411216716143	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.376700061993	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.388722891947	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.355839680458	We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt.
0.0	0.328369679377	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.291554256859	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.379372578533	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.303410727041	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
1.0	0.685825950425	In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.
0.0	0.303263615012	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.489356833381	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.458206471037	Their business model is greed and fraud.
0.0	0.540613977802	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.35449482605	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.470012193296	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.280786858558	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.417325359939	People came back from Iraq and Afghanistan without legs, without arms.
0.0	0.337746675607	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
0.0	0.368871064148	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.422035042261	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.45352675342	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.303690713525	Now, it's very interesting.
0.0	0.437839292093	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.372754817188	Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.
0.0	0.483944715046	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.277592138649	So should the UK, so should France.
0.0	0.379673215219	Well, I got it for two reasons.
0.0	0.412055355705	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.367045465882	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.426824128753	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.300243771521	Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.
0.0	0.28402524007	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.
0.0	0.317851649499	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.263063289981	Barack Obama wants to change America.
0.0	0.393021225431	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.450379387543	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.378287940906	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.47048390324	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.42495537291	The big banks--
0.0	0.584470055882	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.345177777363	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.239913994613	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.413253630107	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.299987016291	Bret, we're just starting.
1.0	0.742063342093	Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.
0.0	0.294186105827	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.0	They know.
1.0	0.713325300046	And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.
0.0	0.0	You know why?
0.0	0.330410303097	Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle."
0.0	0.478578442561	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.303816799379	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.0	That's what he is.
0.0	0.309158957836	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.430142791034	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.36989669132	When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.455631321294	It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.
0.0	0.269047112862	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.46062822433	And if they have to be in the Middle East for 20 or 30 years no problem.
0.0	0.0	This is 2016.
0.0	0.412777167001	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.412485152857	And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.
0.0	0.358264305105	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.275051166515	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.318352873592	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.393352777493	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.373793936602	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.261663210715	I know, Bret.
0.0	0.407132454818	Parents, and sons, and daughters and family members, and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them, we must remember this, that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century.
0.0	0.331046902488	They won't accept it.
0.0	0.338914935168	And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition.
0.0	0.478725070888	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.410334991076	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.348288692143	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.153462303092	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.504416632165	I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone.
0.0	0.355231718786	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.378454085206	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.312090667189	And, look, there are profound differences...
0.0	0.306239050799	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.308775968019	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.
0.0	0.434364095211	I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
0.0	0.37481976109	You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?
0.0	0.379034711971	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.421945772311	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.466591798285	To tell Qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep.
0.0	0.343154197592	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.412017982492	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.299805818512	Marco can change his mind.
0.0	0.432591346479	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
0.0	0.387117281116	I do agree that in particular, Turkey and the Gulf nations have got to make up their minds.
0.0	0.422380888109	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.402519716764	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	1.0	I never said that.
0.0	0.392214858798	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.447436101363	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.380946299351	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.345608541537	We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States.
0.0	0.41856103179	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.330510606365	If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
0.0	0.377862174112	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.317989450042	We've got the consensus, what we're lacking is political leadership...
0.0	0.419214120236	And we have people that are controlled by special interests.
0.0	0.41039386429	Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
0.0	0.352720176319	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.372572740127	The NSA is another big issue.
0.0	0.350915505416	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.229757093443	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.420916859027	All the time.
0.0	0.371481679446	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.395428248282	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.54707787362	Not assets."
1.0	0.673039641495	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.438002106383	They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.44812795862	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.421674479719	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.370255146824	But those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort.
0.0	0.460108503661	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.46086199017	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.379339541438	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
0.0	0.366942938387	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.479486438034	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.329079146865	Divide that out.
0.0	0.23651421558	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.386255546206	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.319191905694	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.367918793712	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.
1.0	0.612576400118	Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.336155935347	And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.
0.0	0.397924273522	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.393660481091	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.221858907007	That's not the America that I think we should be.
0.0	0.422513919817	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.261948737767	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.314355772894	He believes everything he stands for.
1.0	0.429541541689	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.291055029153	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.36020779605	... we will secure the border...
0.0	0.379191960726	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.334696168009	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.415591737316	People have invested a lot of energy into that.
0.0	0.27499317897	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.295880872862	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.30563880362	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.445740496506	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.380218513438	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.36505112033	The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering, these are not the perpetrators.
0.0	0.429354184351	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.388764739076	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.451789397191	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.397059020192	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.312393564593	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
1.0	0.459723087501	But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.
0.0	0.324900457536	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.461354313521	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.385425487234	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.361894765763	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.421155603914	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.495268657717	He was on the board.
0.0	0.421510142902	These are often very long- term kinds of investments that have to be made.
0.0	0.237935445507	If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.
0.0	0.434020989042	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.338343281188	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.387578427279	So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has.
0.0	0.485717590935	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.372536693245	If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune.
0.0	0.26217552537	That's kind of a no-brainer.
0.0	0.319988860057	We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America.
0.0	0.530837173894	People have been paying it for years.
0.0	0.345802827129	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.405468737406	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.226353348126	I do not think it would come to that.
0.0	0.567518835967	And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion."
0.0	0.308672129933	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.385777694822	And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.
0.0	0.417623410516	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.396977279384	I was recruited to H.P.
1.0	0.428607632145	However, what Alan Krueger said in the piece you're referring to is that if we went to $15, there are no international comparisons.
0.0	0.313144147883	I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it.
0.0	0.37013578667	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.422284691134	I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.
1.0	0.591671841602	7 percent and 8 percent to go to college?
0.0	0.523594092473	... saying, no middle class tax raises.
0.0	0.412131889299	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.367432330498	You know why three?
0.0	0.327531582409	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.310299183005	And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.
0.0	0.330777208811	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.329556443263	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.355674817448	The no-fly zone, I would hope, would be also shared by Russia.
0.0	0.470841926427	Many are in this building.
0.0	0.260474877095	I understand.
0.0	0.326349497702	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.323873836965	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.412548098625	We have the U.N. Security Council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path.
0.0	0.280445183402	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.453572007922	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.351770581516	That can be done without profiling people.
0.0	0.0	These...
0.0	0.389630473738	These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy, and our economic power in alignment with our principles.
1.0	0.465928250964	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.304168240304	They will not bring us -- believe me -- to the promised land.
0.0	0.388543294345	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.366706165102	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.335451546408	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.37661508768	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.360057306532	It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino.
0.0	0.305751842922	We know about the French.
0.0	0.448723311777	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.246187119633	I love China.
0.0	0.445717257603	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.171227855861	Who are we kidding?
0.0	0.567269384435	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.38683058898	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.
0.0	0.241026919178	I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.
0.0	0.477405381968	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.393656651046	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.354436494957	I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security.
0.0	0.363454946887	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.376673927504	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.353968975837	Ford.
0.0	0.246135239839	I can do that.
0.0	0.349754565155	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.370085533072	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.437951694844	He's been a negative force.
0.0	0.428698959664	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.446902844542	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
1.0	0.409412086738	Well, we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists.
0.0	0.388056640195	Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.
0.0	0.362077894756	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.375357190392	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.422526719675	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.298145843149	And Martha...
0.0	0.371918923829	It's great to be at Trump Tower.
0.0	0.516448728842	I sell apartments for -- I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.
0.0	0.344089850196	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.262414674446	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.318992318978	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.346490492397	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.344138054099	We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.
0.0	0.370027837615	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.378304912112	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.
0.0	0.369835211298	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.312237855702	Now the Libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge ISIS from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.
0.0	0.387726238648	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.
0.0	0.0	I think what is...
0.0	0.414032288205	In all due respect...
0.0	0.275309133634	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
0.0	0.490172755256	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...
0.0	0.42967063354	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
0.0	0.375863345021	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.387545758452	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.614227091296	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.31793132802	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.387549462708	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.351568212011	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.379516298071	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
1.0	0.296874343951	A lot of people up there can't get jobs.
0.0	0.269461222397	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.485899504626	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.418771870321	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.376010677961	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
0.0	0.362225982773	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.371758145944	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.354295772725	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.0	Yeah.
0.0	0.437177690587	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.428371236277	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.374778162935	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.360040490077	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.447148599121	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
0.0	0.378794491969	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
1.0	0.638680687614	Very few children.
0.0	0.289505264127	And I hear their speeches.
0.0	0.417899404459	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.0	Right?
0.0	0.419564909286	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
1.0	0.542514716931	He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.
0.0	0.332113662245	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.289624701873	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.418461955986	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
0.0	0.396205953228	But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.
0.0	0.437588238676	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.269255608164	Oh, great.
0.0	0.471074375601	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.336105411698	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.256071115589	Let me say on that...
1.0	0.623515249951	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.34293512542	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.438124853344	For example, it is outrageous that we don't have an opportunity for Medicare to negotiate for lower prices.
0.0	0.480922024592	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.510494236887	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.301834257025	No, I've never made a promise like that.
0.0	0.387182138262	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.378350480027	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.443350282967	I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
0.0	0.504095947846	End -- end Common Core.
0.0	0.360033998484	I say, "That's a terrible story.
0.0	0.363177828778	So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.
1.0	0.447718970792	He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage, and what its effects are.
0.0	0.430017442719	That's off the table...
0.0	0.328181226627	Now, what does that mean?
0.0	0.471415243024	There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.
0.0	0.339128052234	I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.385377595148	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.292105775145	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.362316478806	But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything.
0.0	0.376107611712	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.2678223291	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.530431927218	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.410778567468	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.439308769678	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.430068403475	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.331927425565	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.36901625207	I beat China all the time.
0.0	0.443665816788	It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.
0.0	0.355721548459	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.412712189089	But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.359809598549	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.42786472488	First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, "they cannot have it all."
0.0	0.394493666423	Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.
0.0	0.335188616612	And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen.
0.0	0.312821627531	... and I encourage everybody watching this tonight to please, acknowledge that by going online at martinomalley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism.
0.0	0.428813544823	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.368539604823	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.39687013841	And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina, and many other Republican states, that because of their right wing political ideology, are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.503563376023	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.323262415851	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.308406651248	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.293531778375	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.520664941743	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.254823881183	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.377485281629	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.367745234992	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.
0.0	0.407351028762	And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.
0.0	0.280713059438	So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.
0.0	0.253223488348	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.277804327227	But look, we didn't know what was happening next.
0.0	0.452547558078	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.37156582354	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.37277521344	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.25547294101	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.362090735349	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.303786851168	That means everything.
0.0	0.324991382426	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.280643608794	And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth.
0.0	0.301193281489	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.337007968753	The people don't work for us.
0.0	0.437764190251	But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance.
0.0	0.361814279366	And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before.
0.0	0.362598293035	This is revolutionary for education in America.
1.0	0.451634561745	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
1.0	0.461861197864	Today, we have 272.
0.0	0.436991348686	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.301080879856	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.35923400059	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.318800818363	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.310339124233	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.431241199842	We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.461931079618	I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department.
0.0	0.370889612402	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
0.0	0.444654682986	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.253166393894	And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a -- that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.
0.0	0.238562297337	Look what they did in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.367663516345	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.435389295844	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.
0.0	0.436104406812	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.404279217697	I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor, I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very, very powerful and most important of all jobs in the United States, the president, whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country.
0.0	0.36968548338	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.313645699706	How the hell can you vote for this guy?
0.0	0.51115084785	Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts.
0.0	0.0	Let me just say this...
0.0	0.377525366149	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.431218285317	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.430126001514	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.444629330351	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.260711038374	I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...
0.0	0.429436314757	The world has changed.
0.0	0.282530044515	But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate.
0.0	0.0	They think they are.
0.0	0.338505051724	And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives.
1.0	0.463469405267	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
1.0	0.396350796242	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.443579354252	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.386286345793	We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.
0.0	0.324506357352	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.301048804907	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.178108418136	You're welcome.
1.0	0.783128707476	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.266843577452	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.301319555156	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.369989012042	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.499201709063	Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.
0.0	0.294040541743	He's wrong.
0.0	0.430559350299	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.406773893041	No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.
0.0	0.391539050866	And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.
0.0	0.308020269145	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.367144472465	I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out.
0.0	0.342146275247	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.344689076224	And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.
0.0	0.407305052165	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.488486641283	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.277590026611	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
0.0	0.470378673539	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.354656333586	All of us want equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.404829604473	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.348499363593	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
0.0	0.372018436705	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.274608508689	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.439776062241	I have a comprehensive, tough plan.
0.0	0.437963812729	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.480807340038	Number one...
0.0	0.388179369016	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.433724427011	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.351474707741	Like, I'm standing here, I -- I watched the video of Senator Cruz.
0.0	0.397827470649	Chris I was mentioned in that question.
0.0	0.0	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.421206524075	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.363832637268	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.361376468572	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.42976237259	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.226888487072	He sure did.
0.0	0.295977813686	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.363767912556	My background is different.
0.0	0.480500547722	We've enacted it in our state.
0.0	0.401861689786	We can triple the border patrol.
0.0	0.296103081489	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
0.0	0.426427756539	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.311713494046	That's what our parents and grandparents always did.
1.0	0.697472407713	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.
0.0	0.328661678721	We are rebuilding China.
0.0	0.376725781341	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.372104369516	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.410371201599	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.460794445354	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.347014891302	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.338287293797	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.379388250497	I am against the raids.
1.0	0.255710722233	We owe Japan more than that.
0.0	0.301665612739	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.428333601402	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.334847959792	And I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate.
0.0	0.295328661509	But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything -- everything, they got away with it again.
0.0	0.479160546604	It's their money.
0.0	0.411117680068	Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region.
0.0	0.219144612202	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.371529887365	And I think that's the false choice...
0.0	0.413667971397	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.394890550539	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.317187947571	And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.
0.0	0.262603795271	She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.
0.0	0.299050799659	I said no.
0.0	0.304707558247	We need money.
0.0	0.2434313256	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.473509621701	That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.
0.0	0.435043028443	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.493867874315	Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.
0.0	0.285411739149	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.445171791966	This nation is the most powerful military in the world.
0.0	0.470122866618	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.213785467859	Great.
0.0	0.394949675678	Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons.
0.0	0.331289155913	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
1.0	0.55997145492	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.494004543384	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.247064838412	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.446598604085	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.360648965348	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.437198741179	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
1.0	0.643459543085	They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
0.0	0.275107135295	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.286072142818	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.412907610885	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.428186850667	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
1.0	0.698138681854	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.30136450003	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.329029829971	He's an entertaining guy.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.317725747457	They will not.
0.0	0.474079812946	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.456034919624	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.315032816818	I need your help.
0.0	0.3937557522	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.476554756059	Clearly the best piece of veterans' legislation brought forth in decades.
0.0	0.444785634072	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.354646003669	It was terrible.
1.0	0.701017399193	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.428807527023	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.387380410721	Both served.
0.0	0.49271229745	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.331701655356	If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're (inaudible).
0.0	0.353522744808	He was a little teddy bear to me.
0.0	0.345000089555	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.383924459409	I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not.
0.0	0.369802583063	I said, "What's your problem?"
0.0	0.38921632818	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.317034640342	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.254015241166	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.392371600736	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.292217732425	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.286275645362	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.327950509825	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.
0.0	0.285476501098	Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth.
0.0	0.371598474791	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.430231254707	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.411212594222	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.483515129748	... and 85 percent of gun owners agree.
0.0	0.395529149999	That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities.
0.0	0.346105592605	That's my view.
0.0	0.303598834105	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.337559675109	There are hundreds of things like that.
0.0	0.466446780614	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.334884524419	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.366834160349	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
1.0	0.27259501848	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.312967008539	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.358882568304	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.261283900672	But let's be clear.
0.0	0.378968351382	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.386788322409	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.418469774686	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.437061308553	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.32938842714	I heard what they said.
0.0	0.288337725087	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.386855230389	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.396638664194	Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.330008127872	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.330099239929	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
0.0	0.35325705212	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.260053446144	And I believe he is absolutely right.
0.0	0.312498952203	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.402582294498	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.359418627542	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.220278714465	I love the Saudis.
0.0	0.367506765267	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
1.0	0.607988869584	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.290801001384	I think we're missing the point here.
0.0	0.396333322785	You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
0.0	0.329973841043	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.428404977428	I do respect Rand.
0.0	0.37711376131	There will be a process.
0.0	0.410069786265	Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.
0.0	0.427726075866	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
0.0	0.313881611282	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.464166085109	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.258409975613	We've got to hate the Muslims."
0.0	0.362479864026	They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
0.0	0.354752077321	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.474969335299	This is the election...
0.0	0.470391223441	You have to lead.
0.0	0.375785668507	So, I thank you very much for that.
0.0	0.230635341496	It never happens.
0.0	0.418438397807	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.262715156703	You looking at me?
0.0	0.460806933481	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
0.0	0.324312928668	I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.
0.0	0.436293283046	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.361339144357	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.411990013404	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.337031453317	We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
0.0	0.247764396255	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.370042996775	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.30658681055	How would we act?
0.0	0.479638804885	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.468198249333	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.54800765356	There was a minimum wage at the state level, and some places went higher.
0.0	0.37279060025	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.419347177169	And, yes, we are at war with those people.
1.0	0.524500252735	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.309477773311	You've got to go the extra mile.
0.0	0.339330382921	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
0.0	0.329020203889	The Obama administration.
0.0	0.391559145013	And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.
0.0	0.470293208303	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.254636605923	Let's be frank here.
0.0	0.363755528271	The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.
0.0	0.279501915989	So they put together this.
0.0	0.436838833549	We have people that are morally corrupt.
0.0	0.393799453489	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.308544038266	They've advertised that.
0.0	0.44161963147	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.328767815811	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.44384234191	That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.
0.0	0.463268278157	But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks.
0.0	0.385949026214	They can provide resources.
0.0	0.399872352447	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.405855401013	So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
0.0	0.379513952162	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.372631378262	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.428686794979	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.349255454597	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.320421914355	Megyn, that's the problem.
0.0	0.361232981551	But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you.
0.0	0.220278714465	No, I love them.
0.0	0.453084898555	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.385759650236	You're seeing cities like San Francisco, cities like Los Angeles doing it, and they are doing it well and workers are able to have more disposable income.
0.0	0.311185490949	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.330314146785	I love this country.
0.0	0.330379618878	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.471578762274	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.345182831624	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.210186488805	I don't want it.
0.0	0.331887769099	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.321601038275	Let's have a Democratic Syria.
0.0	0.318690509558	I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen.
0.0	0.421879355497	Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.
0.0	0.498595732955	And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.
0.0	0.260275147081	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.296910589143	I think there is a consensus.
0.0	0.355739211434	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.410525437967	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.334981140344	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.267691709531	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.343932367967	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
0.0	0.34208399064	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.
0.0	0.0	But what...
0.0	0.32592779949	I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis.
0.0	0.410801525915	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.373461569717	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
1.0	0.715485416192	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
1.0	0.67289567444	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.271399076177	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.391572277	The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.
0.0	0.353605455904	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.36907294194	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.
0.0	0.350078954884	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.363005160159	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.385509652918	We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground."
0.0	0.429472336368	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.496668167739	We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels.
0.0	0.299089863368	It's affordable for everybody.
0.0	0.421456266009	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.456285773415	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.2546291828	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.320337404183	And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.
0.0	0.476528517693	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.370459672969	So the fact is that we work for the people.
0.0	0.437332084809	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.38376305724	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.288400248938	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.308085813958	I know the bad ones.
0.0	0.421417388703	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.349885331515	It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York.
0.0	0.279511899398	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.361602152715	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.334869719303	You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying.
0.0	0.367370641711	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.546681009423	We ended up with 56 votes.
0.0	0.414264820298	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.469591321935	Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.
0.0	0.0	That is not right.
0.0	0.388715301175	Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top.
0.0	0.395682747896	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.38001179244	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
0.0	0.385571547657	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.278287609971	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.403667464424	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.0	Think about that.
0.0	0.274511490535	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.
0.0	0.41240765395	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.472037937687	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.347786629466	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.395971578188	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.45869151743	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.544648680598	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.281869702672	And I watch the speeches.
0.0	0.346518410187	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.
0.0	0.38471595906	I'll advertise my Web site as well.
0.0	0.41527931347	Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people.
0.0	0.294895670578	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.438224618756	You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?
0.0	0.319401366658	But actually I am.
0.0	0.317596453365	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.297418203781	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.463273575023	I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of State, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now.
0.0	0.376575853	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.400021871057	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
0.0	0.461090895003	You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks.
0.0	0.373869574893	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.264178446632	They'll all come back.
0.0	0.435991101805	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.316359797208	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
0.0	0.353745878983	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.507007908358	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.372781575395	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.435373666488	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.446258065264	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.393027633209	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.277954338733	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.361774492159	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.
0.0	0.380438019288	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.466214728901	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
1.0	0.467552008628	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.463179713796	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.352207384	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
0.0	0.387648038642	This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.
0.0	0.491828645027	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.4383350851	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.254535114972	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.312451940223	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.337089167841	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.294165580918	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.460412981133	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.448228611698	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.362374022073	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.339704682283	It's called the politics.
1.0	0.711537503803	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.348654021279	I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries.
0.0	0.504185636513	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.362153829746	Man (ph), their mother's here as well.
0.0	0.438201338685	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.277492991187	Does anyone know this?"
0.0	0.361372421265	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
0.0	0.288346747093	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.432905486351	And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.
0.0	0.577822644148	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.396412223033	It's become more complicated.
0.0	0.514742894515	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.270098694266	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.360097364564	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.353680305589	We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.
0.0	0.386287361158	And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process.
0.0	0.389110882671	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.337307262408	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.304477741078	Those are all really positive developments.
0.0	0.396806790889	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.454104523753	It is a tragedy all over this country.
0.0	0.634144932037	Do the $12 and you would index it.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.262079261905	So I would say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.374515654572	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.
0.0	0.272671623197	We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets.
0.0	0.420091930779	It was the most highly sought after -- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
0.0	0.311687527758	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.269670548054	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.404382030878	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.379324577324	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.408832450108	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
0.0	0.295156841011	It's coming from more than Mexico.
0.0	0.351068474614	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.369424452803	If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country.
0.0	0.421246082607	We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
0.0	0.504167391355	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.366121220541	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.454725928077	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.431586073477	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.354301462132	Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values.
0.0	0.421732761133	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
0.0	0.405112353541	And it's-- it's a worthy debate.
0.0	0.41282583308	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.313821294496	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.373154828378	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.461451549078	If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship.
0.0	0.562692989081	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.451842278338	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.387993523617	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.405651025701	Check it out.
0.0	0.303818680024	We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game.
0.0	0.0	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.410225918285	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.381560785463	And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.
0.0	0.397821837612	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.361343026958	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.394618935146	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.277208178306	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.420557916435	But, I would also add this.
1.0	0.551713793339	That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.
0.0	0.328652460223	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.252664712605	I think any parent would be so proud of them.
0.0	0.425827442756	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.511674034063	And universities.
0.0	0.428579476565	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.481264220866	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.401409296231	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.3546211485	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.3248570643	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.358699483669	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.4289139432	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.250789692263	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
1.0	0.693203498738	Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education.
0.0	0.349436309179	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.431451262137	We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.
0.0	0.284411003309	I like them.
0.0	0.268076631771	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.262433287517	We need -- we need somebody -- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.

0.0	0.473020160327	I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.
0.0	0.294581351382	I have a wonderful family.

0.0	0.477534987548	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.

0.0	0.411802719612	What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years.
0.0	0.409771628765	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.440506594084	I led the effort, unfortunately unsuccessfully, against deregulation because I knew when you merge large insurance companies and investment banks and commercial banks it was not going to be good.

0.0	0.404369585	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.
0.0	0.484958448092	Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions?
0.0	0.396459861313	It's making...

0.0	0.413629908269	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.363652928214	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.376008074146	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.413703752173	I think the issue here is -- and I applaud Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.333569609979	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.443958160952	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.459840927635	In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...
0.0	0.351042125382	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.330272297753	Let's reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.321647221244	Revolution never came.
0.0	0.301996436935	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.

0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.293478422543	I waited and I got the scars to show for it.
0.0	0.275359619587	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.400195166526	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.

1.0	0.637178660575	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.360195322516	Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...
0.0	0.444996710656	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
1.0	0.612617273211	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.410472941103	None of that information was looked at.
0.0	0.274983894029	I know the good ones.
0.0	0.371491571735	But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.
0.0	0.444432613966	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.305973571268	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.381324509508	Marco voted on the other side.

0.0	0.381019429962	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.345789530864	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
1.0	0.732085160862	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.
0.0	0.320663984931	The answer is no.
0.0	0.407065994953	ISIS, now, is the major priority.
0.0	0.348285632177	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.438878295474	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.37796367176	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.41012216929	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.370737728474	If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences.
0.0	0.353777454479	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.346446379795	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.
0.0	0.447615641025	We only have one or two.
0.0	0.303604180378	Look, here is the reality, folks.

0.0	0.507880407168	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.193625735774	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.348774431777	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.437187768653	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.348206507867	I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.
0.0	0.377358512668	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.354264795796	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.339039592352	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.287732813508	But we came together.
0.0	0.371184189417	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.449942737414	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.324404591769	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.254615322895	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.301389624446	Because I've seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime.
0.0	0.326099647122	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.211657242185	Okay, thank you.
0.0	0.193523665964	I really am.
0.0	0.342035504925	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.
0.0	0.368822068129	Well, we're going to have to redo the way the prescription drug industry does business.
0.0	0.240160181151	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.319494935688	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.378170889698	And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
0.0	0.226312933891	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.333581209996	But I said, "Don't hit Iraq," because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East.
0.0	0.427650153117	Wall Street today has too much political power.
0.0	0.461488235578	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.321921393915	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.367064523325	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.
0.0	0.44484530369	I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here.
0.0	0.436304542991	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.6015683104	So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion.
0.0	0.497065907995	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.355251010847	Never support.
0.0	0.381394039246	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.353767436225	It sounds crass.
0.0	0.434661106344	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.322603666816	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.364786868239	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.37403190886	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.328783790113	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.379385019745	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.242627436218	He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, "No interest."
0.0	0.329879782649	I would just say that...
0.0	0.319830875041	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.363102226139	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.372502558117	He is a good man.
0.0	0.318694270386	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.287264168204	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.386923581747	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.538521080741	You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56 percent, equivalent to 56 percent of the GDP In America.
1.0	0.569117857	Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.
0.0	0.253630140398	You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.
0.0	0.232058759383	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.259176093441	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.346415668058	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.397237062532	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.269053784922	Let's...
0.0	0.311067574333	He said, "You know, I make great product."
0.0	0.425134541013	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
1.0	0.51091680175	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.537205135959	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.430150358397	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.464696338724	So it's unfair to say in total...
0.0	0.353326562093	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.299775576082	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.387335134762	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.367482545183	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.43111789228	I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
0.0	0.351851247233	I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.
0.0	0.287525314005	But we stuck to our message.
1.0	0.443030129646	And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
0.0	0.366898481601	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.426151373991	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.419557138024	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.537503393465	Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.
0.0	0.3118870121	I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.413185786022	It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.
0.0	0.329417291618	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.614316106445	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.279747104862	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.408461492938	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.452594414746	Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force.
0.0	0.349743552736	They have children who are doing so well, I've met and worked with dreamers.
0.0	0.30413560619	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
1.0	0.594912764619	And I have assets -- big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected -- 9 billion 240 million dollars.
0.0	0.259515564089	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.305670890231	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.371066364464	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.487533815077	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.269513265036	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.344657949221	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.
0.0	0.333186405663	People aren't dumb.
1.0	0.388992997074	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.395664475376	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.410323180514	Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability.
0.0	0.0	So you know what?
0.0	0.379101543624	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.432941510363	She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.380334597731	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	1.0	That's true.
0.0	0.497245154082	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.486368510144	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.446902635674	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.348035169169	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.231403272061	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.407348651571	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.421171040074	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.361269930235	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.427843177927	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.403961681159	They sweated like dogs.
0.0	0.337269277599	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.417633582631	We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be -- we ought to send our surplus.
0.0	0.352137528643	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.364052038177	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.336930066206	As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe.
0.0	0.469617029751	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.284411003309	I like them.
0.0	0.348929278953	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
0.0	0.353148785483	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.335413468233	We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
0.0	0.343243619971	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.336713899924	But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."
0.0	0.256324621747	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.394798225678	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.425467634159	And I opposed it.
0.0	0.392901232433	We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy.
0.0	0.360663407285	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.283280622963	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.286499804783	John, I think somewhere between...
0.0	0.332190042688	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.445306058328	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.370080024439	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.4353008316	It is ISIS.
0.0	0.308838871502	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.376636475124	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
1.0	0.532642064819	And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent.
0.0	0.285460187451	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.336961876326	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.256623194048	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.251331353726	We're running.
0.0	0.341856479416	Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
0.0	0.433481285855	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.373529285325	But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country.
1.0	0.75448559431	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.309376372412	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.361765737404	Folks, it's not too late.
0.0	0.454249969195	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.289714085064	Let me just...
1.0	0.49868280923	We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.406471984552	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.494898811621	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.0	That has not been...
0.0	0.403294314002	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.384962069022	And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details.
0.0	0.502276401827	We were the first in the family.
0.0	0.427628880957	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.
0.0	0.370415934592	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.405620365795	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.398060877884	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.441554252878	In the last 30 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth.
0.0	0.411799449457	My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, which sparked my interest in the need for immigration reform because I know what it's like to be the son of an immigrant.
0.0	0.479098047267	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.361366337728	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.337345168426	And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.
0.0	0.344931648761	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.3173643021	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.428166085715	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.414164913545	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.379909367937	I made it the old-fashioned way.
0.0	0.363555384334	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.506892464683	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.42032649676	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.370446202484	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.403420067494	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.413121179207	Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago.
0.0	0.401879349462	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.246135239839	We can do that.
0.0	0.357254687909	All of you in Iowa, I need you to caucus for me.
0.0	0.450650183318	Paul Volcker, one of the leading lights of trying to reign in the excesses, has also said he does not support reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.457748363055	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.388044228855	That's a wonderful business model.
0.0	0.361413133669	We're rebuilding many countries.
0.0	0.436357426066	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.30381054315	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.329228636149	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.419851684765	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.284411003309	I like that.
0.0	0.403708427346	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.587666337606	It costs me $3.
0.0	0.363720243532	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
1.0	0.42369642946	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.41214813683	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.339034703616	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.330353517414	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.375711011754	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.0	That's what we believe in.
0.0	0.420961763861	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.232182436993	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.260654388054	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.362593984592	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.287008602631	Looking forward to it.
0.0	0.472175686825	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.27066755281	And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.
0.0	0.356178955687	Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone.
0.0	0.322472966004	You've got to be on top of it.
0.0	0.0	But Megyn...

0.0	0.213889771755	We have to do something.
0.0	0.402478479371	I was there in '89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.
1.0	0.478971721203	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty, and we're the only country in the world -- virtually the only country that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.434870948789	I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart.
0.0	0.372702430509	We did our own rallies.
0.0	0.39417166386	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.264549178257	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.462336474241	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.428919698902	The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court?

0.0	0.293021049783	Didn't just happen.
0.0	0.467092032631	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.322259437492	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
1.0	0.617308274874	It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate.
0.0	0.276336137426	I kind of miss him.
0.0	0.25679227278	And that is what we have done in Ohio.
0.0	0.455526829711	That means medical.
0.0	0.27249128769	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.295132429282	You learn to create feedback mechanisms.
0.0	0.311698980356	We will see what the American people are willing to support.
0.0	0.497201081039	And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.380280874718	I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House.
0.0	0.403626584978	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.344438956123	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.336817090998	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.48109619395	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.403613927151	We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it.
0.0	0.222425249316	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.

1.0	0.625281773961	What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons.
0.0	0.363324956778	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.443100206982	We have people that have no incentive to work.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.376554631	Let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.278528474956	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.467104037121	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.344689469111	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.321880135768	But I was born here.
0.0	0.409491008955	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.37045497293	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.211468348285	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.339001233031	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.3768428371	The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
0.0	0.309761379484	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.25571752228	I know how hard it is to build coalitions.
0.0	0.455030376781	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.437535951153	A military island.
0.0	0.34538251503	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.387778047457	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.363095978517	But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand.
0.0	0.36474075004	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.38168460975	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
0.0	0.339524802784	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.341682175384	They wouldn't be there except for us.
0.0	0.397031286898	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.48099036854	But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
0.0	0.386016662586	They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.
0.0	0.359869311714	But he used to say, "Donald, don't go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.380251612015	But the facts are simple.
0.0	0.383993515689	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.403851894646	A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.
0.0	0.320169941863	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.345235744681	That is the issue.
0.0	0.499803720882	Why is it that we are spending per capita far, far more than Canada, which is 100 miles away from my door, that guarantees health care to all people?
0.0	0.454281460168	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.463787856615	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.313270440842	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.403906834305	It is enormously complicated.
0.0	0.34599111274	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.274261862162	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.405037596072	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.0	No, you did.
0.0	0.319948689033	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.354860090211	That is an egregious act.
0.0	0.343543500054	He said, "Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."
0.0	0.299840060039	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.478420884639	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.403811337739	And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians, who are also flying in that space.
0.0	0.29500066619	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.27574239399	It really is important that we go forward on this.
0.0	0.318020296832	They can't lead us.
0.0	0.563908529186	No criminal records for them.

0.0	0.250675909688	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.389978071832	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.454674805403	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.415799235538	And now many of these candidates want to cut it.
0.0	0.344280443701	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.480960933309	When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
0.0	0.389039512807	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.397055661313	It is not a barbed wire fence.

0.0	0.159040270091	I think you're --
0.0	0.425559136654	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.387075421071	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.453677230007	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
1.0	0.584754603507	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
0.0	0.404779831263	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.421286262009	And we have to stop all the divisions.
0.0	0.340014936167	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.288971794639	... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.
1.0	0.453434844825	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.35429588762	I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.
0.0	0.350899895531	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.246135239839	You can do both.
0.0	0.401526489891	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.292295509398	They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there.
0.0	0.438602491834	On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center.
0.0	0.423560230513	It means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana.
0.0	0.422101185054	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.39166020135	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.329117164163	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.42083972193	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.487596547563	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.355247774186	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.548334559382	... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record.
1.0	0.449195387748	John -- John, this country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.412238372429	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.566894168069	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
1.0	0.663573045558	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	1.0	It's true.
0.0	0.299928943444	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.495253864711	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.369857654936	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.543090231853	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.410521700053	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.404945951092	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.364425976354	We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.
0.0	0.387476049386	That's the difference, and that's the kind of leader we need in the White House.
0.0	0.356810723275	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.338020221146	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.329759769653	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.380889625662	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.29149801869	He said, "I can't get it into China.
0.0	0.37782768232	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.362225982773	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.0	What do we do?
0.0	0.329613407599	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.
0.0	0.413904929166	Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.322535512609	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.415752577245	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.252032283754	Oh, yes there is.
0.0	0.353703928173	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.441395497814	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
1.0	0.666887855536	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.41852917742	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.276462380139	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.445555488682	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.287521489957	We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.
0.0	0.460361216071	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.37677271479	And I will go back and say again, AIG was not a big bank.
0.0	0.220631673344	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.261881756684	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.541987472806	We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.
0.0	0.426114449031	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.233965130296	I'm going to support you, and I think that is absolutely appropriate.
0.0	0.389904547292	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.
0.0	0.442120658678	I'm one of the 77 percent.
0.0	0.370986096805	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.353983449933	I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran.
0.0	0.261284086547	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.409610270939	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.337744612414	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
0.0	0.344183926991	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.346076368781	I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.
0.0	0.388779895145	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.428357148616	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.319776078131	We need sound money.
0.0	0.406701572577	But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.
0.0	0.375921088332	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.307622696698	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.36450308597	All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.
1.0	0.639266949049	They were wrong.
0.0	0.419356658871	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.293552571134	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.347165135022	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.452147114882	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.287855249979	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.288192055666	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.358788449647	And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.
0.0	0.294027923944	She never lived to see that.
0.0	0.363169768733	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.40549084621	If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W. Bush made after 9/11 when he basically said after going to a Mosque in Washington, we are not at war with Islam or Muslims.
1.0	0.603115158884	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.350733891905	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.353859366919	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.399898432394	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.267486683494	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.432721690275	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.349826129027	I think that what we're facing with ISIS is especially complicated.
0.0	0.406624544551	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.394489145126	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."

0.0	0.217986415187	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.496748024859	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.0	Think about it.
0.0	0.475193003595	And in that capacity, I met with just an extraordinary group of people from World War II, from korea, vietnam, all of the wars.
0.0	0.455915570611	People died, and only three people have been fired.
0.0	0.385635992131	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.428351905477	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.380614766325	Here's my promise-- Wall Street representatives will not be in my cabinet.
0.0	0.465147092914	The business model of Wall Street is fraud.
0.0	0.367450984626	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.412102416531	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.277620427308	Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.
0.0	0.421113658614	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.327263234136	Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title.
0.0	0.341600483215	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.
0.0	0.344710725046	How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
0.0	0.37738563734	They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.226802889946	We say "we're gonna protect."
0.0	0.371054694314	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.378422573229	And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.
0.0	0.384907946459	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.448553447978	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.453368686643	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.221130003307	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.24472277339	I gotta do it, Dad.
0.0	0.327947158408	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
0.0	0.557180901894	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.487598017677	You do the arithmetic.

0.0	0.504550075747	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.494695651349	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.403147122283	He said, "Yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam.

0.0	0.439369811969	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.206815161388	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.384193461384	We shouldn't have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time.
0.0	0.346410611599	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.393946481875	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.
0.0	0.491360319516	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.

0.0	0.377994104487	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?

0.0	0.35243760005	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.377219353158	What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria, when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family you'd better get out now.
0.0	0.417973528995	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.

0.0	0.38610656473	They beat us all the time.

0.0	0.439599523852	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.371334897655	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.312294417564	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.354798769685	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.431132630763	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.369901848891	Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.

0.0	0.288346747093	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.409804670175	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.39101038364	My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.

0.0	0.471397750031	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.394275911484	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.

0.0	0.378408415637	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.392379966584	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.284908626321	You know, this is not easy work.
0.0	0.35407902802	I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.
0.0	0.414353110878	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.

0.0	0.322903436484	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
0.0	0.425647286316	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.460180332352	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.316052847626	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.339201846522	He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
0.0	0.41368632195	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.
0.0	0.323363759484	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.315885948466	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.36334118465	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.487805131354	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
0.0	0.249908971024	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.403767639041	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.369168977881	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.314078848905	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.373825264356	We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.
0.0	0.402861700821	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.397417883256	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.273675284984	So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.
0.0	0.295145231193	So, so important.
0.0	0.323386413775	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.364099921648	Great state, great people.
0.0	0.326992906472	If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say?
0.0	0.486258614057	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.34047077033	I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
0.0	0.392859006226	It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.
0.0	0.401296236394	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.328608531057	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.
0.0	0.388945416819	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.243736952617	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.453163952136	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.363414956849	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.415679835642	I am on the committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.394417322391	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.406074319966	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.329981265936	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.347434477673	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.321822924908	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.0	Think about it.
0.0	0.420774436609	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.377738121125	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.417569484655	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.412522203123	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.0	You did.
0.0	0.267706709458	Well, sure.
0.0	0.319454851955	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.37514804185	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.327005770764	But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
0.0	0.400849066677	They should be Muslim troops.
0.0	0.290838014881	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.369002408683	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.329405488359	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
0.0	0.399524210986	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.345305388509	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.414477266582	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.362886927655	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.457726616491	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.387935635048	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
0.0	0.423460470105	Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country.
0.0	0.444061804807	So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.
0.0	0.316390875275	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.315670263925	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.327680380067	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.346545614428	I would prioritize them.
0.0	0.402672377623	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.331680017294	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.294563038616	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
1.0	0.523501997166	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.386293639049	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
1.0	0.592213443526	In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.
0.0	0.395717472021	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.420915639129	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.428738590012	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.355367656532	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.167542266243	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.310851238971	No, John.
0.0	0.41358559983	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.278209986764	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.375426800623	And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.
0.0	0.277107982577	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.328963361542	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.385958847928	And we have to do more to prevent the flood of foreign fighters that have gone to Syria, especially the ones with western passports, that come back.
0.0	0.518208232611	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.316383260125	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.387325744741	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.379321449496	But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks."
0.0	0.483785382988	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.
0.0	0.375106579287	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.396617945536	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.436650008632	Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?
0.0	0.361834636392	Well, I would just repeat that.
0.0	0.291629967815	It won't happen.
0.0	0.330119800743	Martha, if I may...
0.0	0.318203697085	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.409414736263	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.
0.0	0.418913907811	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.329956570193	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.412441484105	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.497411249269	... people all over this country -- not you, Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other.
0.0	0.276437421216	Now, this is getting to be fun.
0.0	0.469958991308	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.470087735363	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
0.0	0.455529337864	Lehman Brothers was not a big bank.
0.0	0.429731975834	So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating, but the highest median income in America.
1.0	0.545953427828	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.361406707906	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.294608123626	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
1.0	0.40473748326	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.340236825273	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.304827477811	You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America.
0.0	0.331787344763	They wanted Boeing's secrets.
0.0	0.371643306432	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.262654851632	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.
0.0	0.376257861625	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
0.0	0.486929914382	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.372648300221	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.363016466901	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.23452491375	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.317030209262	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.361436997477	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.44647764373	Tear down the EPA's blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates.
0.0	0.429703728297	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.419054384736	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.274293175196	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.368676542494	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.427667056316	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.371632429343	Carly Fiorina.
1.0	0.558411248565	And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions.
0.0	0.381238704695	in particular.
0.0	0.428592059902	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.501387135756	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.343530312686	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.484846364322	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.478836497224	In addition to that...
0.0	0.299050799659	And, we said no.
0.0	0.246135239839	I can.
0.0	0.408548229381	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.4295013855	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.0	Why is it...
0.0	0.422345490074	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.351604163772	And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
0.0	0.317093644888	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.252238157099	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.432122359872	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.428822043001	The nature of warfare has changed.
0.0	0.259647638264	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.377865287641	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.363552081855	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.376817215626	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.33729610168	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.252947252474	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.429614871164	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.370135295818	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.521630849054	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.390927980219	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.246135239839	And we can do it.
0.0	0.374276425052	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.362955295977	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.406717863893	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
1.0	0.839314963667	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.368465401125	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.275734854215	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.303707638338	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.352795108115	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.286954282218	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.306061226711	Good at email.
0.0	0.404994324388	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
0.0	0.317010485959	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.380230526993	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.330069954249	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.487093776122	That's not the role of the government.
1.0	0.651293400744	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.360636809007	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.236753496411	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.393961001156	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.406149762579	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.412717556977	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.294040541743	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.426047603769	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.322816842472	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.402532465445	... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.431026169767	There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America.
0.0	0.348669338774	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
0.0	0.31585038435	I don't care.
0.0	0.402502085651	These are very, very real issues.
0.0	0.313105304061	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.251590282334	Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.
0.0	0.446176546997	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.355801953801	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.274072717299	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.370879344813	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.400435317972	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.386612561814	Martha, may I -- Martha, may I...
0.0	0.396159684713	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.439172565382	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.265924044625	Well, I've got news for you, we can.
0.0	0.313406101661	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.478951911767	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.382761926865	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.351494721717	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.353430776334	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.395915908896	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.298152504862	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.462927418224	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.370635546329	But it's a lot safer.
0.0	0.375669097829	... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do.
1.0	0.524635729231	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.38653700254	Well, David, I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country.
0.0	0.419108821924	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.31786058361	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.454601486017	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.
0.0	0.347712337427	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
0.0	0.338747177938	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.43571363703	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.370085287475	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.415605347815	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.354692858	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.343017303922	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.462475328604	hospital that needs to be improved and made better for them turned over to privatization.
0.0	0.332077487326	Maybe now we can get it moving again so that we can upgrade it so that it does include all the tools and everything in our arsenal that we can use to try to work with our allies and our friends, come up with better intelligence.
0.0	0.337452076798	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.260034872041	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.431335517164	I think that is the number one requirement.
1.0	0.404792742067	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.31346905739	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.244966183878	And you have to really work hard at it.
0.0	0.302519263936	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.311159040231	I like China.
0.0	0.455973799282	It has too much economic power.
0.0	0.393813652448	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.35692248207	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.549295286174	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.397523634528	For her convenience.
0.0	0.462816121626	We have a corrupt campaign finance system dominated by Super PACs.
0.0	0.313171067313	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.458733607587	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.370151838624	And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.
0.0	0.372476464263	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.402960248855	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.430866792999	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.
0.0	0.350585096589	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.
0.0	0.394878485067	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.466184325849	In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.
0.0	0.257250419676	We get Bergdahl.
0.0	0.55010688573	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.335982493595	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.335821797616	It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably -- probably -- from the Middle East.
0.0	0.375785668507	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.375127164989	Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."
0.0	0.358965959365	There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
0.0	0.0	What are we doing?
0.0	0.213838852173	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.312508289969	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.333686821572	People say, "Oh, you don't like China?"
0.0	0.41734818568	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
1.0	0.430733387133	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.237557018587	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.416241517754	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.412966199048	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.407011316121	He thinks low wages are a good idea.
0.0	0.340239061697	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.294479897626	Let me respond...
0.0	0.369433110422	But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.
0.0	0.354934587398	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.462024461142	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.513459037555	And second of all...
0.0	0.351496599499	I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country.
0.0	0.385232163646	Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
0.0	0.309105620214	I do and this is an important issue and I know we'll get to a lot of other critical ones as well.
0.0	0.347704549637	I made it when I ran in 2008.
0.0	0.439976778408	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.360559737396	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.418120780245	In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill, "Well I assume Hillary has told you about this."
0.0	0.368158950825	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.45420011726	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.242170139246	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
0.0	0.288695731405	They can't.
0.0	0.387827094552	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.429049364208	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...
0.0	0.269871405042	Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.
0.0	0.411954941715	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.
0.0	0.308396482838	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.250587405744	And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?
0.0	0.504405789403	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.394635149474	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.229825705597	That can be done.
0.0	0.0	It's not.
0.0	0.35033703141	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.466975853439	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.359374492246	When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.
0.0	0.271837550395	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.242717658368	I have to tell you.
0.0	0.507240417474	Seventeen more million more people have health care.
0.0	0.662264175968	$1 billion a day.
0.0	0.422905912723	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.221605860402	I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
0.0	0.46892132192	I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place.
0.0	0.247373749962	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.296943955793	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.412961262578	The central question in this race is trust.
0.0	0.364819587058	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.462314018185	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.270105215028	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.222251671743	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.384179649993	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.346090321547	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.389918055371	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.292406255804	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.504206233638	We have artificially low interest rates.
0.0	0.370224972741	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.299723981635	If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen.
0.0	0.433467305209	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.383414082371	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
0.0	0.274722115224	All right, Nancy, I really wish you'd come back to me on this on this one, John...
0.0	0.435135055746	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.363812528991	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.282366003871	Now, here's what is going to happen.
0.0	0.329078632978	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.462862686951	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.442008605582	And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.359411835905	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.40529363791	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.303073399478	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.420540851876	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.429400759308	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.0	All right.
0.0	0.420442588897	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.327687570107	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.391330545721	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.333214069138	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.427932215258	We have to stop the money flow.
1.0	0.709945001983	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
0.0	0.285572390993	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.401610220286	You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.
0.0	0.405582003731	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.4542764577	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.31293810274	Our president doesn't have a clue.
0.0	0.368455601672	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.447777007095	We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.
0.0	0.39458026725	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.386177358682	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.285401107761	We got nothing but problems.
0.0	0.498833140034	Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally.
0.0	0.344961384762	Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
0.0	0.153394866733	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.389389812878	You learn to create a security cabinet.
0.0	0.27784076737	You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.
0.0	0.371864975295	It's time for real substance and real experience.
1.0	0.463846549317	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.17994709768	They knew that.
0.0	0.425090915343	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.390157086292	The United States has, unfortunately, been victimized by terrorism going back decades.
0.0	0.304707558247	Because we need money.
0.0	0.288537449679	Neil?
1.0	0.657835042761	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.505334174657	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.287833904067	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.460254717496	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.30313429177	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.368628501457	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.422002569051	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.37170255414	And here's the problem in this country right now.
1.0	0.420143771555	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.347608774439	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.
0.0	0.367203429372	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.395192982274	Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come...
0.0	0.462363309187	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.444538150242	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.345813661809	I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail.
0.0	0.253516103478	Those are your enemies.
0.0	0.362958749353	We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force.
0.0	0.250248017515	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.463122424381	Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.
0.0	0.500774391592	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
1.0	0.627501026395	And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph).
0.0	0.309827481826	Our vets may see the V.A.
0.0	0.469644155145	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.411593569221	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.454319271331	He's the one that did Bergdahl.
0.0	0.393956235469	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.420744458809	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.417156532524	The United States must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.397288529551	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.377702496325	The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.
0.0	0.213890606183	Wow.
0.0	0.346739165166	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.302662111194	So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly.
0.0	0.518323983045	The number of women --
0.0	0.309506505176	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.327448699024	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.319394208334	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.339184333965	It's very important we operate on both at the same time.
0.0	0.328712100907	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.325686732426	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.426209622593	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.379612483127	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.398012260728	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.
0.0	0.398511438241	I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.
0.0	0.312645462955	I can promise you.
0.0	0.422103658643	No one here is under FBI investigation.

0.0	0.37677743029	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.345904729704	Washington is broken.
0.0	0.311104249581	But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting.
0.0	0.206815161388	Look--
0.0	0.316669778289	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.437818245635	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.32875808996	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.344276670635	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.443869916387	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.400988224878	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
1.0	0.632198775528	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.238211636746	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.
0.0	0.359279999036	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.352819505879	They're going to take away thousands of jobs.
0.0	0.372454591598	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.267254472177	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.455091797697	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.343399824565	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.429765115165	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.385042567561	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.283349953799	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.522784416651	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.259307862429	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.362877986252	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.299270812238	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.373277320602	We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.
0.0	0.399557201389	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.361082424861	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.
0.0	0.453998693018	You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super PAC and they're advertising against me in Iowa as we speak.
0.0	0.373500885757	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.420308567361	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
0.0	0.409918241563	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.418580341267	I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.
0.0	0.357903716581	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.36815119252	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.0	And why?
0.0	0.305114507675	Now, I understand that this is very difficult.
0.0	0.219241235671	They're off to China.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.230635341496	It never happens.
0.0	0.369512643841	This is absolutely absurd.
0.0	0.471977833827	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.447014566292	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.378601212527	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.403015537827	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.388061062383	Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.

0.0	0.325915148316	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
0.0	0.439173044349	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.321889980654	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...
0.0	0.328583936495	And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.
0.0	0.421493251214	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.416805034652	This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.
0.0	0.364689434124	As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that.
0.0	0.266780937469	And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
0.0	0.286785393493	That is exactly...
0.0	0.322173470315	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.36436035115	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.0	Right.
0.0	0.399256296076	So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.
0.0	0.373616317564	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.320207895221	They're terrified by the saber rattling.
0.0	0.278088031985	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.379090597256	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.391960151196	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.355006179616	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.436236984296	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.298040896422	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.369618687844	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.275087461182	So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
0.0	0.440628420526	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.306553437937	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.266033279424	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.431636016773	John, I would disagree with Secretary Clinton respectfully on this score.
0.0	0.378692468444	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.300696523434	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.420621104716	This is a complicated issue.
0.0	0.420482011907	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.379747830101	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.30845198343	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.312086252503	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.24432165998	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.362336809177	I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.
0.0	0.396548744842	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
0.0	0.275359619587	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.446714846991	We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq.
0.0	0.33705981001	We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.
0.0	0.36889098444	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.391143127678	But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.
0.0	0.318706439255	We need a collaborative approach.
0.0	0.380899225705	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.421104452922	Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor.
0.0	0.455524064994	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.307847994227	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.359384608301	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.420822204524	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.274559495693	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.342193551559	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.
0.0	0.479226787224	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.401414639654	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.49317018644	Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.
0.0	0.380891616321	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.383846088901	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
1.0	0.626123266037	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
0.0	0.397388941645	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.265393868156	I've done it.
0.0	0.273434779703	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.210886356053	Here's what I'd do.
0.0	0.341330625052	Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country.
0.0	0.477341756367	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.361730721464	But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue -- requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.310914497915	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
0.0	0.43940493306	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.503547059007	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
1.0	0.422290973505	It's never below zero.
0.0	0.379728263637	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.361801549709	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
0.0	0.357845675206	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...
0.0	0.288632740843	No vision at all.
0.0	0.393267171085	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.

0.0	0.29505375872	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.404599216018	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).

0.0	0.428239862943	Doctors are quitting.
0.0	0.303707302498	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.357119054773	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.394019424444	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.570095268545	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.371189226945	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.385009360383	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.260364771053	I just want a job.

0.0	0.393961599384	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.383998150971	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.213785467859	He does great.
0.0	0.286764830266	Because a lot of people said, "He'll never run.
0.0	0.27982680174	It is not tough talk.

0.0	0.309492448737	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.278030256315	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.365993259392	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.35568644332	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.420012321838	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.465631206414	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.33225640044	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.349455718128	Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
0.0	0.324686719862	But wait, I just want to say this Senator.
0.0	0.0	She was right.
0.0	0.555682177231	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.256071115589	Let me say this.
0.0	0.356256723865	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.417408473788	I want this bill to be voted down.
0.0	0.385985501631	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.378761447426	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.

0.0	0.330943326021	They are not doing it now.
0.0	0.299050799659	That's what I said.
0.0	0.196169816201	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.377958577491	The endorsements that I'm proud of are conservative leaders like Dr. James Dobson, and over 700,000 contributions nationwide, people going to our Web site, tedcruz.org.

0.0	0.252091044508	They don't know how to bring it about.
0.0	0.452162965805	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.273194105896	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.

0.0	0.374606522925	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.335916619418	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.410764575437	As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election.
0.0	0.293573958196	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.38913754557	Well, this whole issue concerns me.
0.0	0.479522448863	Secretary Clinton also said we -- it was not just the invasion of Iraq which Secretary Clinton voted for and has since said was a big mistake -- and, indeed, it was.
0.0	0.193215995578	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	1.0	That's not true.
0.0	0.333476359487	But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college.
0.0	0.313894449585	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.280163569847	And I do not believe it's a good idea now.

0.0	0.526782360717	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.304079050641	I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here...
0.0	0.338836515855	What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy, and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need.
0.0	0.286742614917	I am glad Donald is running.
0.0	0.363417162175	I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.
0.0	0.184830827275	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.338294407445	And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016.
0.0	0.289725184974	I don't think a halt is necessary.
0.0	0.488405029705	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.

0.0	0.289632951488	We've gotten off the Hillary's e-mails, good.
0.0	0.323535791374	I am advocating...
0.0	0.377755261531	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.314217808239	And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?
0.0	0.458287846163	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.354888653233	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.
0.0	0.280948782786	I would not want to go to that point.
0.0	0.428105779564	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.262216436632	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.402170180113	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.

0.0	0.2416113072	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.383207488781	If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.
0.0	0.46593269279	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.413269011268	When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it.
0.0	0.336849184919	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.379371673148	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.31317526022	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.369898078614	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.

0.0	0.307298150687	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.335447589487	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.331195398994	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.0	That's it.
0.0	0.414510132603	First priority, destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.27887149991	They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists.
0.0	0.396311706819	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
1.0	0.34196097066	I didn't have an involvement with them.

0.0	0.321909006364	Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.
0.0	0.240639377262	You're right.
0.0	0.375654444465	Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy.
0.0	0.386681197887	I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.
0.0	0.465436207826	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.376804907648	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
0.0	0.495968645553	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.247962348386	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.368115086537	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.463873966434	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.409980374565	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.380208249863	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.41925228744	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.373729333463	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.314968113948	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.362878598523	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.200773859156	I'm running.
0.0	0.278327004518	We have nothing.
0.0	0.244835878041	I don't think we're at war with all Muslims.
0.0	0.546888359807	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
0.0	0.293748767942	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.381064695163	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.286799204906	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.412574951455	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.396477513648	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.46370840805	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.319131301308	I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.
0.0	0.0	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.472063222712	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.357019489201	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.393952894831	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.307657377778	Just get me a job.
0.0	0.398666293129	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
1.0	0.715214915978	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.381961537373	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.411753261007	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.378090430393	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.427305984608	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
1.0	0.431576220591	We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks a piece.
0.0	0.358364395906	And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.
0.0	0.360934961454	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.162299685277	Whoa.
0.0	0.383359518888	And I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well.
0.0	0.342002931436	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.315885948466	We're up 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.369128901305	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.395859966851	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.454366661748	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.39465751084	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.241777031093	We got it.
0.0	0.298853851497	And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe.
0.0	0.244310893882	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.377307713174	And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't."
0.0	0.503264165613	I introduced...
0.0	0.0	OK...
0.0	0.529880267758	Close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole and...
0.0	0.44374669178	I spent a lot of time in the situation room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us.
0.0	0.381202484376	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.392390728648	We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.
0.0	0.315016676898	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.0	It is.
0.0	0.395028528574	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.472434029975	Support community banks and credit unions.
0.0	0.220830163955	And there's a lot.
0.0	0.299641540172	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.0	That's right.
0.0	0.39135107515	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.33796713137	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.288348413553	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.429336530456	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.408979942639	And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.
0.0	0.401039979634	I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.
0.0	0.188765916286	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.0	We know about the Belgians.
0.0	0.428914769463	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.409204129328	It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.
0.0	0.340628078818	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.375343332884	So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
0.0	0.518955688459	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.0	Right.
1.0	0.412239212386	I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded.
0.0	0.320962140345	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.2833686615	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.393988587336	First of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy, as you've indicated.
0.0	0.34514151902	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.235793537525	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.397071945756	That's the wrong number.
0.0	0.338443277124	Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire.
0.0	0.389415064769	And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country.
0.0	0.357359341103	We must able to work collaboratively with others.
0.0	0.328074910412	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.392848004729	You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future.
0.0	0.471429198241	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.337849804447	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.292450774962	I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.
0.0	0.409830235295	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.338951155523	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.385794002122	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.363069705464	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.240639377262	You're right.
0.0	0.408182500553	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
0.0	0.371505574626	It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.
0.0	0.270539912455	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.417673712492	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.271705209705	Whoever heard of this?
0.0	0.268395081982	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
1.0	0.566075315482	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
0.0	0.356925355112	That's calling it what it is.
0.0	0.493564787293	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.295281132778	Yes, I apologize.
0.0	0.28851219606	Go to YouTube.
0.0	0.306225996502	That's when we become Greece.
0.0	0.380077702441	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.354781746173	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.46893369116	Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.
0.0	0.330342201184	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.469649741838	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.161077876093	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.343612621865	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.328463848601	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.459086957237	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.305026332881	He's very charming.
0.0	0.256546154189	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.402017888446	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.409754992336	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.295029701187	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.0	That's not right.
0.0	0.411164149776	And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent.
0.0	0.233781424167	You're certainly not very good.
0.0	0.0	Here's what I believe.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.328261030697	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.41427586969	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.552543152908	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.361277086048	They kill us.
0.0	0.442725677797	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.453575844518	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.540443724068	You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.21568396328	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.315808259797	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.474146558326	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.226888487072	Sure did.
0.0	0.0	What do we do?
0.0	0.488531902972	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.353326562093	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.387640148807	Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly.
0.0	0.313922356723	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.305654766123	And I think has had a big impact.
0.0	0.429231207741	I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.
0.0	0.270584641464	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.426236363349	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.352264768964	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.430403462573	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
0.0	0.478248667282	We need to end minimal sentencing.
0.0	0.243990333939	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.356088728332	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.288537449679	Neil...
0.0	0.463858780594	That would be a disaster for this country.
0.0	0.369182231582	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.294072547903	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.260347635882	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.380564810932	We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.
0.0	0.546861374246	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.405854364633	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.421165183746	But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said.
0.0	0.355148508959	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.339845059978	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.328669448498	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.260713504474	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.395657014927	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.366003401974	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.0	And...
0.0	0.268562756115	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.287464189044	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.409501114397	And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
0.0	0.260396234246	You know, the situation is this.
0.0	0.394560796031	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.410160521939	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.325922459786	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.331444584739	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.354418482415	How has it worked?
0.0	0.257250752134	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.201019725537	But they're not good.
0.0	0.329635911597	And that this world, with American leadership, can and must come together to destroy them.
0.0	0.367930383033	People who we should be welcoming and working with.
0.0	0.367511878856	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.479873509772	They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.
0.0	0.317865901097	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.356397126155	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.395947591988	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.431567091781	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.372020313303	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.333186405663	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.285107983569	You want one?
0.0	0.3272637189	May I respond to the critique on the ...
0.0	0.346912498293	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.328763692319	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.318426498424	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.397933017801	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.339921356851	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.419947993702	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.269158966497	That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.
0.0	0.394607013165	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.371219347154	That's the big leagues.
0.0	0.36902192432	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.385395381296	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.363050347626	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	1.0	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.317254120156	And we need the right people.
0.0	0.380798286543	I am the son and grandson of immigrants.
0.0	0.364528267777	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.257647254506	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.38220598514	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.419822819169	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.369708825494	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.326251139657	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.
0.0	0.282883322667	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.515559886374	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.338381045327	What would we do if this were ebola?
0.0	0.31341499306	Look, the secretary is right.
0.0	0.347973728772	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.451551971303	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.0	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.340317150436	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...
1.0	0.593626558197	We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.
0.0	0.352443630708	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
0.0	0.295108377487	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.419566530522	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.355388281178	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.316809188074	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.382484995588	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.393175996324	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.279073047962	I agree completely.
0.0	0.316809806501	We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
0.0	0.430505659015	Meanwhile, the rich get richer.
0.0	0.365865741358	Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity.
0.0	0.281011960895	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.486375546242	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.265393868156	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.419197050729	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.428288396045	The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.
0.0	0.410877780287	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.388248201613	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.362998571325	We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it.
0.0	0.202048124842	I happen to think...
0.0	0.311024607836	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.410534637201	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.419307783229	But I agree, as I mentioned a moment ago, with King Abdullah.
0.0	0.391947585185	And we also need a cheerleader.
0.0	0.427405060665	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.484420076041	She voted for it.
0.0	0.193279082745	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.439316806437	The simple fact is, we all have a record.
0.0	0.502743937684	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.162309244846	Alright.
0.0	0.473003808431	She led that effort.
0.0	0.437350572733	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.410612990997	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.344595712826	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.329355343491	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
1.0	0.381089599304	He's not wall street.
0.0	0.0	Have to do it.
0.0	0.378932049624	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.434209612506	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.284355279395	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.460538285926	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.384504265844	Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face.
1.0	0.535596086477	$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work.
0.0	0.387929794347	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.420079396758	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.327208915881	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.362842329379	To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.
1.0	0.618506003694	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
0.0	0.373069279468	But at the end of the day, no doubt, the Affordable Care Act is a step forward.
0.0	0.478972306495	There's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.
0.0	0.217424731643	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.342663304242	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.428835454991	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.302925077536	Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.
0.0	0.362255663804	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.404533739419	There are a lot of factors involved in that.
0.0	0.393265428917	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.411864917347	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.454319271331	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.176717909649	Yes, I'm getting...
1.0	0.279511899398	Don't believe the 5.6.
0.0	0.265504983633	You really can't.
0.0	0.346912498293	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.0	It was against Assad.
0.0	0.38058614368	We need, basically, to pledge that we're going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.
0.0	0.345545507549	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.38276524527	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.328722180797	You can't do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they're as threatened as we are.
0.0	0.38080831403	So, in terms of refugees, I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe, with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that, of course, we reach out.
0.0	0.439943607345	Why do -- why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major -- the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?
0.0	0.407612351644	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.444026882275	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.555586449148	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.354430903567	Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.
0.0	0.349917317871	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.
0.0	0.375705870446	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.396633631553	We will -- when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice.
1.0	0.420722365931	2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.
0.0	0.550310714671	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.412345238859	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.435174703211	ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.
0.0	0.369936534591	That's the right of people.
0.0	0.476120391764	I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war.
0.0	0.379186984965	What is the best way to do it?
0.0	0.360722144607	I gotta build those big buildings.
0.0	0.288941658189	Again, Americans murdered.
0.0	0.429967224994	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.345338305411	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
0.0	0.302661550213	Good evening.
0.0	0.405233980632	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.446442570272	When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.
0.0	0.422884055286	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.361871328232	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.419968342792	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.319568068487	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.355156152102	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.228662078937	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.358351443101	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.303384826066	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.321246556908	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.404444855832	They get them on the black market.
1.0	0.724870167171	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.45619365735	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.
0.0	0.294649347535	But I think it's the right road for us to try to travel.
0.0	0.445494509329	And for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.
0.0	0.353012384243	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.0	No their not.
0.0	0.306503092631	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.377067475684	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.308071474342	In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
0.0	0.30305008244	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.388020691808	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.419386586995	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.508198509133	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.426666741134	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.248795734222	So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do.
0.0	0.317725747457	I will...
0.0	0.528973648357	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.353651400092	It's not about Donald Trump.
0.0	0.461151370126	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.329247323522	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.0	But you know what?
0.0	0.401398468524	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.353682679557	We used to have victories, but we don't have them.
0.0	0.462613194884	They should have made it more open ended for the next president.

0.0	1.0	That's true.
0.0	0.376836552519	When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up.
0.0	0.0	I do.
0.0	0.353997567613	Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.448088908712	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy.
0.0	0.311290995673	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.40946501633	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.364113645717	I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.
0.0	0.330712887596	That was a terrible mistake.
0.0	0.464325799256	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.313613122371	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.578847255496	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.412012094411	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.361062203237	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.504028247974	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.0	All right.
0.0	0.513608044615	Ninety-three hours.
0.0	0.460046268055	You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
1.0	0.538793789585	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.359466244302	I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.
0.0	0.453401952932	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.395097966025	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.361863932076	They are ripping us.
0.0	0.367070233277	We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America.
0.0	0.42731500509	When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it.
0.0	0.301586862754	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.0	No, no.
1.0	0.537043210286	And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
0.0	0.333273263342	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.407849575087	This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.
0.0	0.44419766084	He's not a leader.
0.0	0.41043709879	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.336828260192	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.236189681977	That I can tell you.
0.0	0.478803185437	So there's more to my plan than just the cap.
0.0	0.245996089536	Not good.
0.0	0.437387634724	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.345221066151	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.446056980388	Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.
0.0	0.365294108294	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.665384515205	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.308571931178	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.30118076324	There must be some way.
0.0	0.397523634528	She did it for convenience.
0.0	0.404937409044	We brought together legislation supported by the American Legion, the VFW, the DOD, Vietnam Vets, all of the veterans organizations, which was comprehensive.
0.0	0.296492331121	Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months.
0.0	0.433397929422	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.336490877216	Good company.... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in -- and I wouldn't even use -- you know, I have -- I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
0.0	0.527677131824	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.36787662751	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.412601008693	Our vets have been abandoned.
0.0	0.354255677138	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.444530407103	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
0.0	0.442339400515	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.397744676625	I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.
1.0	0.621734205147	When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.
0.0	0.478670215131	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.437590425	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.385825103824	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.33118529631	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.408215265332	What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger.
0.0	0.261622582819	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.386737785054	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.303833096119	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.417738695427	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.379708182884	And we do have to form a coalition.
0.0	0.355766010224	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.445192524577	And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.35569746607	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.392043832701	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.42826850456	This entire question was an attack, but that's (inaudible)
0.0	0.431139239617	And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.
0.0	0.227738500337	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.355008346683	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.401415083324	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.341483972748	If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration.
0.0	0.388643446319	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.190809535119	I think they'd want to hear it.
0.0	0.319768796043	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.339037891733	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.36732572456	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.462207580777	You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.
0.0	0.384475998812	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.411439087616	Kathie, this was not merely theory in Maryland.
0.0	0.3173127527	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.360363176673	The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.395429515713	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.402914798938	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.362843056461	That's a hard road to walk.
0.0	0.310290681897	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
1.0	0.617674229348	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.455365043272	The biggest bank in the world is from China.
0.0	0.288820894386	She wants to pursue the American dream.
0.0	0.371891120714	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.281088748769	He wants to change America.
1.0	0.552739008846	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.43699860301	And the U.S. chamber of commerce, which hardly ever says nice things about Democratic governors anywhere, named our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship.
0.0	0.445576492427	The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.
0.0	0.393107474343	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.394814985351	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.387277015014	It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
0.0	0.32037080247	We saw what happened in Egypt.
0.0	0.368642862796	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.319335524304	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.344931648761	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.392854992511	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.360392715927	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.3059382466	That makes no sense at all.

0.0	0.369318990027	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.21568396328	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.267834534361	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.276569212183	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.358931910891	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.435825932861	They elected moderate leaders.
0.0	0.471170931406	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.338549839126	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.33791392021	He's not arming the Kurds.
0.0	0.253576291827	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.303487908134	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.320159324994	But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
0.0	0.224106505588	But you know what else they're anxious about?
1.0	0.413898903112	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.378645358473	I have a problem with that, Martha.
0.0	0.385739410301	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.345474002707	He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims -- all Shia Muslims on the planet.
0.0	0.355745183095	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.362111527753	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.45276465963	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
0.0	0.380435357627	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.26617568579	That's who I'm indebted to.
0.0	0.472112212152	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.313705632202	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.448551844861	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.399231475256	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.41063366642	They're not supporting our law enforcement officers, it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.33665934038	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.427088349592	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
1.0	0.522337800933	It was below zero.
0.0	0.328962437295	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.468384303774	ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries.
0.0	0.329634213922	Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer.
0.0	0.377662097508	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.455918232104	This country is changing.
0.0	0.503618102624	I was not the secretary of state...
0.0	0.36825121571	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.180888598947	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.343125015212	Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process.
0.0	0.33108858062	We have tremendous people.
0.0	0.525487238407	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.377119915838	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.175363983794	They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
0.0	0.395025307544	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.496644616189	Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
0.0	0.438256929637	And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues.
0.0	0.402122016368	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.488874389044	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.43696597548	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.540613977802	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.203102055679	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.319792138056	But not for us.
0.0	0.400717413546	I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.
0.0	0.333416722434	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.279340935752	I think it's a two-pronged issue.
0.0	0.369221725873	In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston.
0.0	0.367279004959	Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
0.0	0.352903952751	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.401505721898	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.307325598465	I think I am a nice person.
0.0	0.325966771974	Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform.
0.0	0.329531439941	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.371335027572	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.391885443067	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.
0.0	0.292641542091	And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.
0.0	0.462878577821	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.324980648922	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.34208507316	When you come back to me, I'll share that story.
0.0	0.412666359231	We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.
0.0	0.562783077019	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.255511664231	We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.
0.0	0.320139978442	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.346475959285	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.275074978731	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.338290018692	I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization.
0.0	0.0	All right.
0.0	0.404877945875	He's the greatest show on earth.
0.0	0.389521865624	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.335366690486	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
1.0	0.520102659795	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.321455788863	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.319198352778	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.459570391358	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.443093258591	But Secretary Clinton is wrong.
0.0	0.478030672249	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.195776016008	But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up.

0.0	0.36869160422	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.496000405779	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.

0.0	0.327439556925	I don't think anyone has a magical solution.
1.0	0.517484579836	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.

0.0	0.399022382871	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.362476005527	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.521794130518	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.

0.0	0.273444475151	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
1.0	0.356046613964	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.302888987532	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.463212547943	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.410571478021	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.44112379082	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.571887393719	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.362085945716	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.386234101285	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.345158858269	They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.
0.0	0.439243331918	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.374455956172	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.380407396412	I (inaudible).
0.0	0.409190479564	They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.
0.0	0.363514809512	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.316864992993	I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.
0.0	0.290654963227	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.353986434154	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
1.0	0.432632724455	You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small.
1.0	0.405335474418	Well, John, look, I think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis to leave by 2011, is that an Iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend Iraq.
0.0	0.363443145516	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.40633071031	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
0.0	0.368656217966	And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that.
0.0	0.397076474283	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.338156587155	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.463048904754	I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.
0.0	0.468881394753	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.334498177418	And I have to tell you, I would not want -- if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my health care.
0.0	0.302767687264	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.479274010135	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.59838179563	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.393421816424	I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.
0.0	0.499692742633	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.448397335374	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.364238670175	But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.
0.0	0.546192069583	Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage.
0.0	0.446292586328	And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.
0.0	0.342144366581	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.361766154625	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.338058083895	Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough.
0.0	0.412010333788	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.438603989084	That's fine.
0.0	0.337180673801	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.354684858693	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.382996410178	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.303796978253	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
0.0	0.393690691956	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.0	All right.
0.0	0.412402004394	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.436538745039	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.326451278262	They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).
0.0	0.32981718354	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.387188272675	But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that.
0.0	0.428534123625	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
0.0	0.437775287553	Well, I'm kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time.
0.0	0.410734284984	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.384168821685	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.395174217582	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.348115396882	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.417078784474	They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea.
0.0	0.282645824971	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.555193423958	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.462475821829	... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.
0.0	0.360404121497	And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears.
0.0	0.374486073278	They can provide forces.
0.0	0.438296976012	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.352534923205	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.299541682754	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.425691141198	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.2970726441	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.371117951154	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
1.0	0.500006939803	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
0.0	0.386786196573	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.25623181613	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.403017637955	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.373864037621	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.
0.0	0.203161737339	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.405699654471	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.372056923499	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.454366661748	It is a disaster.
0.0	0.191703129671	I'm getting to that.
0.0	0.369337947254	And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.447044831858	We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital.
0.0	0.317511169413	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.458647219152	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.369836487338	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.499640000323	But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.
0.0	0.465277402052	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.405175556704	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	1.0	That's not true.
0.0	0.466650249765	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.308175500312	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.403396335541	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.28980048587	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.465452817449	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.506099038703	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.379268208872	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.305383148868	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.36349479023	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.346383888279	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.419067357479	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.373777310812	And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.
0.0	0.353043129973	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.354418482415	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.435935354059	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.356779649013	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.316427367285	Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, "Sorry, fellas.
0.0	0.330431777561	I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
0.0	0.428967571338	It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.
0.0	0.495568825149	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.321305540355	Enough said.
0.0	0.42163971983	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
0.0	0.0	It was.
0.0	0.488284950736	First of all...
0.0	0.0	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.345531211206	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.381102595725	As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.
0.0	0.375106579287	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.531391454853	They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.
0.0	0.335351668639	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.295822506058	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.219845878223	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.278723285982	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.396185857652	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.389596663384	And, of course, I met the mothers of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, and Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and so many of them who have lost their children.
0.0	0.245255501611	It can happen.
0.0	0.47938649327	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.383723017437	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.39974354299	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
0.0	0.400447132318	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
0.0	0.413476324025	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.39681989491	We have losers.
0.0	0.371599974171	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.280041827913	That will change everything.
0.0	0.328809089373	He couldn't answer the question.
0.0	0.363693068418	David, I am the very first...
0.0	0.359768107212	One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together.
0.0	0.426125241245	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.495947578399	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.337457679338	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.318576735606	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.280391961888	Maria...
0.0	0.339383779626	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.4434168999	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.505546140842	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
1.0	0.441693748119	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.387941012558	And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.268546519766	How are we gonna -- how are we gonna go back and make it great again?
0.0	0.397578704615	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
0.0	0.406964933459	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.438521903308	And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending.
0.0	0.180888598947	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.346286209332	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.215390131723	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.288695731405	I can't do it.
0.0	0.283587148988	I would invite him, I actually would say.
0.0	0.374500439915	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.348020751046	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.288117679982	She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship.
0.0	0.412712029329	Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.
0.0	0.395894929519	You know where their United States headquarters is located?
0.0	0.270731004698	...Chris...
0.0	0.534153145057	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.394182752501	Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.
0.0	0.478725070888	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.35470435356	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.504570674137	By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started.
1.0	0.411409290395	Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion.
0.0	0.362474353757	They're a scam.
0.0	0.365524579441	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.
0.0	0.387750510473	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.368407486506	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.478975144803	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
0.0	0.420642238794	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.429273864819	Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
0.0	0.387101713698	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.454284777793	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.388343648618	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.379892427015	I will put a price tag.
1.0	0.536812046284	In fact, wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century, after my husband's administration.
0.0	0.32722225015	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.281263759277	You want to know why things don't get done in Washington?
0.0	0.469951182057	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.337026296644	I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.388723920202	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.358153384022	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.417569484655	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.280102818449	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.346886373468	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.345485412682	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.321261847126	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.472716525889	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.378381865875	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.377371651342	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.

0.0	0.317790914457	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.33722906476	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.312048369393	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.

0.0	0.420155291232	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.399432723174	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.36236495053	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.

0.0	0.43374273524	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.361093854152	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.379513384048	He was young.
0.0	0.275332601939	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.304110390725	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.389665085835	Like we have a -- we have a lot of work to do and we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do.
0.0	0.23523277523	Yeah, but let me respond...
0.0	0.36837884111	More importantly, I want kids in Burlington, Vermont, or Baltimore, Maryland, who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade, who don't have a lot of money, whose parents -- like my parents -- may never have gone to college.

0.0	0.450890690426	But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.
0.0	0.40105283205	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.439224990658	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?

0.0	0.0	We know...
0.0	0.555129465101	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.344101811474	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.360449193182	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.412048790901	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.

0.0	1.0	It's not true.
0.0	0.225898836765	And I've been there.
0.0	0.420818627433	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.629637971998	Could we loan you $4 billion"?
0.0	0.402082034858	I think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12 it would be the highest historical average we've ever had.
0.0	0.403891312574	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.362721070527	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.455159352063	When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish Glass-Stegall.
0.0	0.311042851601	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.315294731398	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.343674142396	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.441177684867	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.369272626654	Now, our country needs -- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
0.0	0.288523680383	The mentally ill?

0.0	0.387780167312	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.488558838373	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
1.0	0.2870080681	They're rapists.
0.0	0.393289864021	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.371258555129	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.29688371669	You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now -- it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run.
0.0	0.326100404748	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.436140487425	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.368092205279	Reinstating Glass- Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough.
0.0	0.270660151	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.275332601939	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.438258519486	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.45529052932	Media notwithstanding.
0.0	0.396210413031	Is creating much deeper, closer relations and, yes, coalitions within our own country.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
1.0	0.469791249682	Unfortunately, Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, set about decimating it.
0.0	0.396193178962	And who's compromised and who is principled.
0.0	0.350237723701	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.422147133062	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.413480756074	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.502140861006	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.364697708407	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.37873052577	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.390251477276	... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience.
0.0	0.409707336205	And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.
0.0	0.404415999792	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.0	How?
0.0	0.386676582425	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.380180797757	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.481946074829	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.390214991625	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.403984301912	This is a terribly complicated issue.
0.0	0.220345325384	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.319409572825	I'll give you another example.
0.0	0.39922238291	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.294877825828	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.345628582875	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.370943424961	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.403185401969	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.329541085938	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.446593607977	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.251519322105	But what -- I will tell you this.
0.0	0.373416770536	So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.
0.0	0.213512364472	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.353756041251	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.451668859911	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.356689324277	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.344934801687	You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that.
1.0	0.606480530117	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.474633793311	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.441903281726	I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal.
0.0	0.353453734281	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.363743106728	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.43917655489	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.367382377205	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.527464859841	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	1.0	Of course.
0.0	0.217704295094	We're friends.
0.0	0.405700364828	But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.
0.0	0.370437146809	Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple.
0.0	0.351335608349	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
0.0	0.389041712999	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.445751601031	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.255930669168	What sense is that?
0.0	0.278984198181	We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists.
0.0	0.337704361546	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.337320844701	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	1.0	I never said that.
0.0	0.448154759773	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.310807112755	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.216343159594	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.416526920396	But there is a broad consensus on sensible gun safety regulations that I, coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, will do my best to bring together.
0.0	0.452936838386	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.344073191781	How stupid are our leaders?
0.0	0.453648564729	Our country is in serious trouble.
0.0	0.362594417109	Sadly, the American dream is dead.
0.0	0.42618695521	So I said (ph), "No, that's the wrong number.
0.0	0.38553029171	That is the clear and present danger.
0.0	0.349625907671	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.426865438698	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.271085230145	Somebody said -- thank you, darlin'.
0.0	0.384915205096	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.420758421697	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.293252850962	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.304314955949	You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.
0.0	0.532381731026	We reduced violent crime to 30-year lows.
0.0	0.588192506567	They make a billion dollars a day.
0.0	0.282453897728	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.503061392999	I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader.
0.0	0.405099923193	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.338154170619	And it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer.
0.0	0.406628313371	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.319191421583	And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.354398878118	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.476332911133	They are anxious on a number of levels.
0.0	0.311373090539	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.425625531459	And together we make it possible for a new generation of young people to refinance their debt and not come out with debt in the future.
0.0	0.355732116821	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.469966171704	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.475082477712	So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.

0.0	0.435180107963	We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
0.0	0.323057630096	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.465755254752	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.405743419827	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.292674049568	I didn't say permanently.
1.0	0.395537536188	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.40282507525	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.354173535165	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.433912029824	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.403277902943	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.312336864981	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.551539256283	And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.464047632441	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.504058956513	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
0.0	0.49943158474	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.493792720442	And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.403720122163	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.246135239839	We can do that.
0.0	0.468645714635	And it will have effects in the private market.

0.0	0.396313305078	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.389293409494	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.0	Bigger than that?
0.0	0.403327950514	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.3104805264	I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.344708256885	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.378235245725	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.376566016706	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.295065813158	You can go to my website...
0.0	0.523707347626	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
1.0	0.595757910763	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.346092601459	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.543572042117	Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978.
0.0	0.408482796267	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.420376378556	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.37669473954	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.322816842472	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.346056317003	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
0.0	0.412588818668	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.

0.0	0.38500411607	I hope Congress says no to this deal.

0.0	0.287048008142	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.338588449255	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.303864036528	The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans.

0.0	0.452145073977	They have no plan now."
0.0	0.35987905531	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.337233373633	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
0.0	0.469685212741	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.277106604736	And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.
0.0	0.350310170056	I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.
0.0	0.388248201613	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.404218054406	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.390092659045	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.342463127663	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.281848929766	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.370130387033	Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country -- we would never build in an ocean.
0.0	0.479812025253	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.385745208554	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.372906313191	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.42911438685	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.403018179616	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.
0.0	0.369762554702	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.365307495309	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
0.0	0.400306375028	Now we're having smaller families.
1.0	0.728872428664	And again, paid for.

0.0	0.446162051815	He cut and run.
0.0	0.404619825234	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.437945594912	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
0.0	0.36686471602	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.370932390713	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.335773549765	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
1.0	0.490976786929	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.293477571261	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
1.0	0.517256102993	It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.
0.0	0.38725454435	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.430229167615	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.370862070136	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.725516108937	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.384087260731	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.226888487072	That's for sure.
0.0	0.39110297143	And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go.
0.0	0.446826432728	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.344754931906	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.326479175349	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.
0.0	0.308149985982	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.411428320249	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.386480399647	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.37721753366	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.352315721517	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.
0.0	0.380084057571	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.369550802055	Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.321241532956	I don't think the term is what's important.
0.0	0.293297688318	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.490711997478	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.380520864528	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.392010254024	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --

0.0	0.456985274847	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.379320700185	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.330758641406	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.272337872255	Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.
0.0	0.32033968382	So, yes, I did know people.
0.0	0.255893513478	We need more principle.
0.0	0.39813892827	But if you place good ones, you pocket it.
0.0	0.369890493848	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.288695731405	We can't do it.
0.0	0.317451746699	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.361588247781	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.309201843563	I'm using my own money.
0.0	0.396533811301	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.391804166983	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.243774854461	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.320871234855	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.409112243394	This will end.
0.0	0.392848479463	First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.379258636811	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.
0.0	0.0	No -- no...
0.0	0.526861925364	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.57590570856	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.350933020665	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.307221034148	I will be ready.
0.0	0.463400386221	The first vote hasn't been counted.
0.0	0.410539517318	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.260715774281	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
0.0	0.311985551187	That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them.
0.0	0.377466295137	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.
0.0	0.38784711127	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.396105250482	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.383199290256	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.380663612151	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.0	I didn't.
0.0	0.436957502353	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.232225395045	I think so, right.
0.0	0.421479902237	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.486150382222	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.331326231574	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.450660765644	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.335883883529	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.43254360945	Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military.
0.0	0.358957881518	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.292635534597	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.327886156119	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.35716743708	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.247446954207	Creativity.
0.0	0.301294766526	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.405651025701	Check it out.
0.0	0.355045790645	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.38018261288	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.345919826486	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.301830805737	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.406217425001	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.40496429687	Wall Street is a threat to the economy.
0.0	0.386610374554	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.402026390322	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.434661733693	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.393048216988	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.41887376941	I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out.
0.0	0.221874172221	It feels different.
0.0	0.469737649653	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.360001774498	I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
0.0	0.400675658002	You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down.
0.0	0.351196051804	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.413396854288	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	1.0	Of course not.
0.0	0.454156485158	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.237110718956	Excuse me.
0.0	0.362969947495	A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this.
0.0	0.485221608171	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.329723951929	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.317009782134	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.362509043941	I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college.
0.0	0.375785668507	Thank you very, very much.
0.0	0.429242550246	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.575083592974	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.336173246096	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.316742749722	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.434920861278	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.393593981082	If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.

0.0	0.387385508461	He was vibrant.
0.0	0.451804316875	ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.
0.0	0.329956125198	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.402999864147	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.5378967647	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.

0.0	0.239321079541	You just want to...
0.0	0.273236171336	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.406742496056	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.355589304439	And a lot of people are doing that.

0.0	0.327715418393	And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage.
0.0	0.394217561068	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.364232807355	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.326716109565	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.447080806546	Common Core should -- it is a disaster.

0.0	0.259322049483	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.378867887649	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.317725747457	I will do that.
0.0	0.337539097706	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.45395789552	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
0.0	0.381391733384	We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.
0.0	0.3413634056	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.

0.0	0.445036962105	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.531415957281	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.363869575054	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
1.0	0.790565004893	Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.
0.0	0.393018952654	Everybody thought the deal was dead.
0.0	0.317856642628	There's give and take.
0.0	0.370036685304	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.474719093971	I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...
0.0	0.21568396328	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.350447192415	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.

0.0	0.45596182352	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.514350902206	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
1.0	0.56322280674	The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.
0.0	0.0	Yeah.
0.0	0.34627226031	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.520061630417	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.416378969557	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.52861206272	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.334415695059	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.320368815423	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.313253728516	That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.
0.0	0.488284950736	... first of all...
0.0	0.628048201534	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.337227762473	Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging.
0.0	0.409607128115	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.334594983923	We will do very, very well, very, very well.
0.0	0.358587075059	It's a country in which people choose to buy guns.
0.0	0.327096447485	But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.
0.0	0.333005586011	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.0	No, you weren't.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
0.0	0.310769855982	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.327726375494	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.289162323158	No, I think they won't.
0.0	0.38022607876	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.343177269498	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.320445004761	John, may I -- may I interject here?
0.0	0.403601652997	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...
0.0	0.237110718956	Excuse me, no.
0.0	0.0	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.437518678481	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.348826311562	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.413611745908	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.400395455712	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.0	So what do we do?
0.0	0.388597352236	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
0.0	0.421999418616	Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.249063889271	I'm really rich.
0.0	0.339092618484	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.393699547596	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.365605654907	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.375486016646	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
0.0	0.39681989491	We have losers.
0.0	0.279886488321	I think we all support it.
0.0	0.481358834571	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.355145793659	Get rid of the fraud.
0.0	0.554433950886	It is not because of the tax writeoff.
0.0	0.282555536859	I don't have to brag.
0.0	0.3595057728	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.430220515308	and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States.
0.0	0.267765667441	You get a lot of them that are overrated.
0.0	0.335382559259	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.
0.0	0.471473523293	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.43897169383	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.413252806612	You cannot grant amnesty.
0.0	0.359279999036	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.286482244659	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.310851238971	So was I, John.
0.0	0.309941068727	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
1.0	0.715045346454	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
0.0	0.331424937661	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.336407247141	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.41817409282	As governor, we continued to work together.
0.0	0.435409392787	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.38752582476	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.304051521891	Well, I did.
0.0	0.30326708691	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.520069245225	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.270476107823	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.453692589635	We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.
0.0	0.269592268944	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.488639790128	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.267871565751	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.438193371591	But I...
0.0	0.443813817016	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.297133524513	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.310687942433	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.358918760797	We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground.
0.0	0.38023076964	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.372663614662	So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income.
0.0	0.375958641012	You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.
0.0	0.53595793091	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.284143544621	Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves.
0.0	0.377514916508	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.45311641391	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.346681457503	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.3354396498	And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it.
0.0	0.443461530857	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.362911099729	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.255311400714	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.355080942043	And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump," and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns.
0.0	0.449443969541	If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.
0.0	0.30625920431	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.42194354022	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.426112496768	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.

0.0	0.393957849953	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.315045668835	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.

0.0	0.377019160109	The troops on the ground should not be American troops.
0.0	0.365135069633	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.339262756806	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.226450022022	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.362492596839	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.357645900494	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.463775366365	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.

0.0	0.42590989347	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.0	But...
0.0	0.437597108739	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.324271119871	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.385147117298	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.320760583136	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.
0.0	0.295733956885	I said, "Very interesting."
0.0	0.302044895973	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.39047317199	We both made the identical promises.
0.0	0.296400722425	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
0.0	0.32062681011	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.249363549173	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.405111760049	We have fought, as Democrats, for decades to get a health care plan.
0.0	0.394761311214	We now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act, and I don't think we should have to be defending it among Democrats.
0.0	0.361411176438	We also have to build a coalition at home.
0.0	0.479810887003	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.295256779203	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.

0.0	0.413202650308	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.343493317994	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
0.0	0.39864154783	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.

0.0	0.470974819881	That's the secondary issue.
0.0	0.461437927336	I hire people, they do a Web site.
0.0	0.309174134352	We now finally are where we need to be.
0.0	0.434285613473	Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it.
0.0	0.27504796706	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.498741386855	All through the recession, we defended the highest median income in America and the second highest median income for African American families.
0.0	0.342241456178	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.444666941356	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.318061876023	You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well.
0.0	0.359563058105	I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.
0.0	0.403854199759	Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.
0.0	0.319812771021	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.222677330903	... not everybody else.
0.0	0.320372693861	We have people that aren't smart.

0.0	0.370941798432	I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.
0.0	0.385011524675	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.320984345908	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.
0.0	0.40607948719	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.466471010405	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.486152234114	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.296590086929	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.
0.0	0.259357489857	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.361285661198	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.341804231323	They don't even have a chance.
0.0	0.468811232077	As president, I would make the administrator of USAID an actual cabinet member.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.447139307165	We didn't win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America.
0.0	0.310507825533	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.401208617017	You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.
0.0	0.282696659921	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.288043786845	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
0.0	0.41057721743	Bill after coming home from Japan, flying 33 missions.
0.0	0.486858344445	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.383046794405	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.336951807855	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.36950490914	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.375785668507	Thank you very much.
1.0	0.619988473077	And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.40360663347	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.416524663666	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.440698597883	Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care.
0.0	0.395779599585	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
0.0	0.0	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.370603612445	And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
0.0	0.312693822519	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.404237964635	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.311793874417	And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.
0.0	0.394192780301	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.4677417016	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.462375435664	Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.
0.0	0.322687363951	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
0.0	0.387165951898	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.439957691745	What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.451396548025	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.372205385652	They went to the DNC quietly.
0.0	0.350097020791	That's just media stuff.
1.0	0.472757238	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.496594629929	We're spending over $600 billion a year on the military and yet, significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism.
0.0	0.211468348285	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.409065050481	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.575023141672	We defended the highest median income in the country.
0.0	0.337722605876	But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here.
0.0	0.371131102773	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.396994302367	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.429309008827	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.489885446966	Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.
0.0	0.373580943999	Ask Boeing.
0.0	0.337457339308	And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country.
0.0	0.344756299823	... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
0.0	0.417190197126	It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
0.0	0.39237107178	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.420530337985	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.382231554442	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.355251706261	And there is a lot we can do in college affordability.
0.0	0.402798008704	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.514012921303	It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested.
0.0	0.162299685277	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
0.0	0.433928503313	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.451755101807	What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people.
0.0	0.371229867421	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.351673374369	And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.
0.0	0.510687240981	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.43663825322	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.319171673677	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.269923568479	And we are not England.
0.0	0.362520801771	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
0.0	0.247693297461	He didn't know.
0.0	0.336808210949	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
0.0	0.200630345504	They're not so stupid.
0.0	0.327883374142	Now, you'd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me?
0.0	0.38463109	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.497191317821	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.320663984931	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.327742142114	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
1.0	0.463099786313	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.305046401306	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.447768490543	And also -- also, what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health care outcomes are not necessarily that good.
0.0	0.337011538028	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.313407735423	What a brilliant idea that would be.
0.0	0.417538650978	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.409322987218	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.421511587668	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.379796852039	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.44798876607	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.0	That's right.
0.0	0.342784353867	Well, thank you.
0.0	0.0	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.337335399308	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.374690545798	You count on it.
0.0	0.479398107825	Bill.
0.0	0.311972411731	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.341412604198	We're ready to start shooting."

0.0	0.357506022605	She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.318356411236	So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
1.0	0.499651056316	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.0	How do I know this?
0.0	0.578709870806	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.478009009022	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.26909831991	They don't know if it worked.
1.0	0.461861197864	Today, we have about 4,000.
0.0	0.404246044003	But bottom line now, is in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or her family.
0.0	0.319580210763	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.386791801112	It didn't have the votes to pass.
0.0	0.321292685884	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.372077439876	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.462567753238	If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out.
0.0	0.35645548927	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
1.0	0.401842862892	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.405542504763	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.260800341189	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.460978168976	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.
0.0	0.348249707433	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.311099684793	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.46127536614	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.
0.0	0.33730109655	From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made.
0.0	0.399181892342	So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years -- you know, we're at $8 trillion now.
0.0	0.269550968617	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.427756586894	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.

0.0	0.362154792079	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.45299494831	My patients are beside themselves.
0.0	0.394258217984	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.427619538357	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.401008194256	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.

0.0	0.346101747557	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.256071115589	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.372355902599	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.46888596495	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.310996961465	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.421601609554	So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.
1.0	0.632769587863	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.403514397598	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.246187119633	I love China.
0.0	0.50364816224	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.0	It is.
0.0	0.304804466129	Chris, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.38785571198	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.332367030861	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.494692450394	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.354567713407	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.428217776564	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.327219849001	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.262617862898	It's hate action.
0.0	0.378198123487	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.324507075434	But I guess the final thing that -- that I would say is this is the kind of debate we need to take to the Republicans in the fall.
0.0	0.310009575031	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.

0.0	0.45146487288	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.356122984768	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.405321523979	Sit down with people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the house, and work on a bill.
0.0	0.430288870685	... we have the tools in federal law to do this now.
0.0	0.227823310439	And we're gonna be there very soon.

0.0	0.241777031093	We got it.
0.0	0.274922825399	When I'm president, that will change.
0.0	0.0	No, I have not.
0.0	0.304275322882	And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.489146669098	They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care.
0.0	0.401646892629	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.437195484385	I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that's what Iowans like to do.
0.0	0.292576054201	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.299618274664	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.321621979958	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.427839708756	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.346032804464	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.354899742813	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.380005717509	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
0.0	0.375864758514	As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
0.0	0.345178471206	Who denies that it is crazy...
0.0	0.380238280171	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.265476043162	So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
0.0	0.432490701065	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.395765438969	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.0	That's what it is.
0.0	0.360195716303	It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.
0.0	0.437915028182	He has never defended...
0.0	0.343301008171	Kevin, if I could just jump in.
0.0	0.332595911573	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.326850333623	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.487551575029	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.362370849634	If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
0.0	0.305378286717	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.
0.0	0.344984018928	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.442719046264	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.335103768526	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.
0.0	0.26217234374	That's what really matters.
0.0	0.0	Why?
0.0	0.362474353757	They're a scam.
0.0	0.327435033556	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
1.0	0.404070915323	And the overall message is that it doesn't result in job loss.
0.0	0.295763847981	A step forward.
0.0	0.244809710195	And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.
0.0	0.363292441926	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
1.0	0.77572023927	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.317444199591	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.45422347676	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.246187119633	I love China.
0.0	0.384712074202	I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.390799703455	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.316950616385	Well, you've got to be on top of it right away.
0.0	0.412361447192	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.329808178083	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
1.0	0.348850909417	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.239247579928	Came out great.
0.0	0.454117184814	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.356642547308	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.
0.0	0.418274085956	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.308664556744	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.
0.0	0.352801829721	We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression.
0.0	0.360582625391	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.632359022961	So the total is $8,737,540,00.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.361630002683	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.
0.0	0.293930600216	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.190579234089	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.455177881917	They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
0.0	0.344673032012	And those countries who are opposed to Islam, they are going to have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today.
0.0	0.238750713509	But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.
0.0	0.479031517397	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.255412182184	Jared (ph), Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family.
0.0	0.292983387826	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.33738773519	Planned Parenthood will be defunded.
0.0	0.402829648539	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.39640469285	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.0	It was...
0.0	0.381503913021	And most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that.
0.0	0.350274444824	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.464394799286	The bill would involve legalization.
0.0	0.364462841193	Fact check me.
0.0	0.547406998557	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.269053784922	Let me...
0.0	0.429080322401	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.358220341304	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.
1.0	0.554094705455	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.320600730192	I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video.
0.0	0.404324909825	And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.
0.0	0.430372545992	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.279036539377	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.396724293184	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.
0.0	0.389002189505	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
1.0	0.588843605052	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.512294828161	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.259322049483	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.324439970529	David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave.
0.0	0.37936438187	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.527273217688	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.270465817434	We need to define the enemy.
0.0	0.364635994492	By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa.
0.0	0.378756970483	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.393843701421	Make ourselves stronger at home, but also our role in the world, yes, is also to confront evil when it rises.
0.0	0.319530571808	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.446045995288	What about hydroelectric power?
0.0	0.352838343257	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.347261927614	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.422436816134	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.336851998473	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.2618292098	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.385541024359	We ought to send used equipment, right?
0.0	0.402519518931	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.378817622617	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.378462650515	Hey, I have lobbyists.
0.0	0.415917000726	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.356406948916	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.322925944964	Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody.
0.0	0.42264069961	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.299021182944	Might I respond?
0.0	0.277094581287	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.376569460103	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.
0.0	0.387176846988	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.434386891938	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.466852701008	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.288495273528	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.264144542457	But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
0.0	0.35030260009	And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.
0.0	0.420058859249	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.244097087341	I've always listened to you, Megyn.
0.0	0.318092071296	Somebody said, "Oh, that's crass."
0.0	0.380035356426	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.449306386935	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.335829218029	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.446330886038	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.346029900628	We're going to cut costs.
1.0	0.464916169308	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.360282988116	I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism --
0.0	0.310766774759	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.32743442755	I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.
0.0	0.354374268197	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.352881014834	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.
0.0	0.378601212527	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.427572663794	We are at war with violent extremism.
1.0	0.187893615793	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.312129280037	We don't have victories anymore.
0.0	0.410757371435	Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS.
0.0	0.435523809847	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.566896930665	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
0.0	0.386435719657	I believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation.
0.0	0.419351847579	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.352511206745	Big difference.
