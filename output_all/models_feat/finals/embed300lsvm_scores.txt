0.0	0.492305553096	It's campaign -- a corrupt campaign finance system.
0.0	0.38622972442	Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...
0.0	0.29786954048	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
0.0	0.371193021357	And Martha...
0.0	0.387098507832	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.
0.0	0.405467479861	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.321412278211	Neil...
0.0	0.652695042725	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
1.0	0.610543267163	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.440935058143	But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.
0.0	0.32184436261	You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America.
0.0	0.408179636762	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.309876189138	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.503782819271	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.466447220715	When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.
1.0	0.516252256974	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty, and we're the only country in the world -- virtually the only country that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.460835550127	I am not the candidate of Wall Street...
0.0	0.45327166687	It didn't have the votes to pass.
0.0	0.341085206147	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.387628994662	Our country has tremendous potential.
0.0	0.407283514486	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.37210067888	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.413451099924	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.567778545469	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.425777451152	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.416715941166	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.418551355843	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.404245370491	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.437459847321	So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.
0.0	0.382291663337	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.0	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.0	These...
0.0	0.518617221472	I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.
1.0	0.559389994062	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.549324087918	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
1.0	0.319732983948	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.381245744649	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.36090540256	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.43177572423	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.354152828933	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.428069496424	It's become more complicated.
0.0	0.422118545455	Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.490800110703	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.556245166117	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.339546535806	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.394026170266	But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."
0.0	0.526027595746	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.297772970384	Now, what does that mean?
0.0	0.438309905172	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.272339851386	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.429725263895	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.237930044408	I agree with them.
0.0	0.409176015498	We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended.
0.0	0.291585791783	Let me say this.
0.0	0.294843848321	We needed 60.
0.0	0.498773963922	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.0	Megyn?
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.45031464692	And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.
0.0	0.389368578866	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.404718013335	It was a different situation in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.386251464162	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.352001083706	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.269735880034	It's great to be back.
0.0	0.415033343847	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.0	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.370694719309	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.406518870771	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.414790793245	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.388321294118	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.405738446915	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.300479684373	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.472852685258	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.370632512049	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.478665933451	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.377108363849	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.420084558959	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.372375404346	And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.
0.0	0.328200746639	But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.468396646926	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.343717460158	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.542379556074	So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.
0.0	0.361266234072	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
1.0	0.584857973871	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
0.0	0.0	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.18674984395	How great is that?
0.0	0.332292819779	Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.
0.0	0.324900853082	There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better.
1.0	0.77522290772	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.462112975832	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.400182024856	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.511020941142	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.525358979959	I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan.
0.0	0.454180956002	My oldest daughter's a teacher.
0.0	0.274187092249	So I don't think...
0.0	0.372701139018	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.61846571113	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.285902298203	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.391996806611	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.452655590817	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.283174260174	And it's just not going to work.
0.0	0.413588254343	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.363816009402	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.0	I will do that.
0.0	0.480792385329	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.399180722259	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.
0.0	0.522336418526	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.462777058554	(inaudible).
0.0	0.388206960738	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.395456454128	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.542719051164	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.344078162215	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.5016924301	And then on top of that, we've got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are pouring huge sums of money into super PACS heavily influencing the political process.
0.0	0.173225807967	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.462777058554	(inaudible).
0.0	0.260125867789	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.505441351375	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.293692394298	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.471097307339	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.41895071165	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.378789354204	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.372443509111	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.405955064639	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.516769943323	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.261944604312	A step forward.
0.0	0.429496806882	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.373278725292	And here's the problem in this country right now.
0.0	0.385780401644	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.280460888453	It's a joke.
0.0	0.412042650312	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.403492064086	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.281947959032	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.439498938182	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.397572723848	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.343631492152	In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance.
0.0	0.217433144949	And guess what?
0.0	0.385535557492	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.405490996053	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.445521108356	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.
0.0	0.470289250121	Common Core should -- it is a disaster.
0.0	0.459130086862	Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago.
0.0	0.472597295892	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
1.0	0.561564392774	$10.10 was all I could get the state to do by the time I left in my last year.
0.0	0.402021638102	It's not just Wall Street.
0.0	0.439758479448	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.283892153216	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.415086221384	So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income.
0.0	0.537470600276	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.361927010153	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.387463281052	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.54540374342	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.283546313037	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.286468483952	Right.
0.0	0.296772236884	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.
0.0	0.51825462648	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.551720966308	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.286468483952	That's right.
0.0	0.396191602471	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.350242430737	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.379149886742	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.448100321432	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.30712515795	And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe.
0.0	0.377921963639	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.335254585152	You know, Ted didn't show up.
0.0	0.472137660654	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.263170215794	And that's not what's happening now.
0.0	0.362696499536	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.490121395669	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.505168476234	But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.423725425	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.300050323926	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.419916816702	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.466470459616	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.385449821283	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.371193021357	No, Martha, I would not.
0.0	0.40819930704	I said, "They send it back?"
0.0	0.320756229648	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.456502991801	They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.380594205931	He's in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.3068806112	And they wanted to make sure it got built.
0.0	0.36303728207	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.439149548484	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.378212881279	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.290696919389	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.420904054582	We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.497839161497	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.338880181743	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.409809922485	The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.287120056671	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.446020489952	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.367366522912	Again, Americans murdered.
0.0	0.400600458922	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.380317364919	And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.
0.0	0.394814701482	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.45584272976	We actually passed a living wage.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.345992764214	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
0.0	0.422889075147	And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
0.0	0.176585342004	I really am.
0.0	0.290289730624	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.230279440217	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.354442724605	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.0	They will not.
0.0	0.243988495812	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.
0.0	0.417730036702	And now many of these candidates want to cut it.
0.0	0.479092121257	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.
0.0	0.279616905924	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.490010623889	I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment.
0.0	0.462888327784	And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.
0.0	0.414301483594	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.433038915541	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.387517887601	I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible.
0.0	0.43595839665	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.42085875173	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.472370262922	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.429435985273	That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive.
0.0	0.330210827354	It's not crass.
0.0	0.207889200784	But here's what's going to happen:
0.0	0.33749933743	I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?
0.0	0.38560082297	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.436787588055	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.402306741906	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.396221427944	But also, I can't fake anger.
1.0	0.707773165185	In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.
0.0	0.425791031254	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.403744018268	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.315943995982	Hey look, he never had a chance.
1.0	0.498384817122	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.531521196446	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.437603365651	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.378590945451	I'll advertise my Web site as well.
0.0	0.259355132054	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
0.0	0.37341830191	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.338207821474	They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do.
0.0	0.479293179497	That's off the table...
0.0	0.346061950298	We're rebuilding many countries.
0.0	0.344151062731	If they want to accept our values and our laws.
0.0	0.464683164741	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.276666834641	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.341905574938	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.404866861576	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.422371190399	When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.
0.0	0.396477052581	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
1.0	0.637773978039	And I have assets -- big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected -- 9 billion 240 million dollars.
0.0	0.35433111791	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.35959732826	How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
0.0	0.437574848208	Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.362039813836	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.238932291115	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.404841714017	She did it for convenience.
0.0	0.221637444724	I hate to hear it."
0.0	0.402868709584	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.169935175059	You're welcome.
0.0	0.208178699968	And you know what?
0.0	0.345016238963	I've been to Ferguson, I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.
0.0	0.424417131272	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.587745196628	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
1.0	0.679007301957	They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.
0.0	0.30218692372	If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.
0.0	0.314454494362	You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well.
0.0	0.420868036326	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.353174137728	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.405674940139	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.579320019717	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.253966584964	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.382048779831	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.396282880881	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.147037860128	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.379148520521	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.303518242102	You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.
0.0	0.490049727756	As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country.
0.0	0.464093786316	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.386228332052	So, in terms of refugees, I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe, with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that, of course, we reach out.
0.0	0.317073085038	I would invite him, I actually would say.
0.0	0.43403885746	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.429355147017	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.329634059765	I would change them.
0.0	0.475925345348	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.445647367558	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.31372788042	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.52201428775	You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.
0.0	0.488074947031	But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.291653277092	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.717948423273	Could we loan you $4 billion"?
0.0	0.307547786831	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.444397962306	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.396380482805	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
0.0	0.421095927199	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.374918049525	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.273313793491	So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
0.0	0.417066646842	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.420139750052	First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.589660856324	Seventy percent of our population lives bi-coastally).
0.0	0.381390829001	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.472463501123	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.
0.0	0.463976304642	Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.
0.0	0.296008178907	No problem.
0.0	0.34281245252	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.455146345366	Our country is in serious trouble.
0.0	0.328298963615	They were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.403068629022	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.
0.0	0.452541258946	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.376540437404	But I would say this to you, Bret.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.520958210297	And in that capacity, I met with just an extraordinary group of people from World War II, from korea, vietnam, all of the wars.
0.0	0.444726561145	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.388425666854	Well, this whole issue concerns me.
0.0	0.445946558984	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.394427687986	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.474881648963	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.517666261816	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.432770130706	It was the most highly sought after -- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
0.0	0.390242513082	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.39631746188	So ladies and gentlemen...I am officially running...... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.
0.0	0.528980033952	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.462433767763	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.51684927745	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.395980065782	And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.
0.0	0.315693816298	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.421640176908	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.364141136133	And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that.
0.0	0.414813608863	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.353659139209	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.260974934111	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.427520014829	Our next president...
0.0	0.407016137838	Not only -- not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton -- and I hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- I want to apologize to my supporters.
0.0	0.430533586039	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.405664800116	They elected moderate leaders.
0.0	0.144484467892	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.644932216624	$2.5 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world.
0.0	0.454546713417	Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.45668288128	Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, "Rand, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.440222083829	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.442446630939	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.453317654967	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.361764822459	Ford.
0.0	0.462130449604	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.324422030414	I can't do it.
0.0	0.306459844101	): Secretary...
0.0	0.29542392996	That is exactly...
0.0	0.402828750871	Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.
0.0	0.31342673088	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
0.0	0.312366278327	It is going to be amazingly destructive.
0.0	0.352927723437	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.350815571485	But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
0.0	0.304706384111	And that is what we have done in Ohio.
0.0	0.411549335545	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.336998234165	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.32739374514	You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches.
0.0	0.392737031712	I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.
0.0	0.249116012245	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.357040024149	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.348307123414	But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that.
1.0	0.430975174776	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.340889436531	In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
0.0	0.365445275182	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.37940840251	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.187045965385	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.515051165928	... we have the tools in federal law to do this now.
0.0	0.505217568427	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.256087931195	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.492771871111	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.430081920104	And we have people that are controlled by special interests.
0.0	0.317260564638	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.
0.0	0.395663063031	But I'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya, you would be looking at Syria.
0.0	0.385621105525	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.457680297226	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.152570870981	They're not good.
0.0	0.346180872243	We must keep America safe from this threat.
0.0	0.329068670547	Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.
0.0	0.415911056968	Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity.
0.0	0.417446427146	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.34346583354	We have tremendous people.
0.0	0.526247667798	So under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system.
0.0	0.195350504691	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.347223572362	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.355220495418	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.376840533792	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.321730881149	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.538620675929	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.370352798337	We don't eliminate Medicare.
0.0	0.27585468021	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.21831593171	But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up.
0.0	0.322810925318	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.450001191683	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.411573526491	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.
0.0	0.279715129424	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.421495940015	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.357271046201	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.5118872511	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.248347888498	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.211781121215	That's for sure.
0.0	0.360737998832	They're going to take away thousands of jobs.
0.0	0.405335953735	This is an emergency.
0.0	0.292931336687	We're dying.
0.0	0.388427312612	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.41201382828	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.323255707957	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.

0.0	0.434542473959	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.464863905374	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.

0.0	0.45560631735	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.312003845628	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.539182397071	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.490425117654	For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check.
0.0	0.367962609406	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.437459711721	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.422501088304	Like we have a -- we have a lot of work to do and we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do.
0.0	0.359797291736	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
0.0	0.354643196595	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.437016600529	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.41976444868	Reinstating Glass- Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough.
0.0	0.238932291115	Wow.
0.0	0.475233586323	If we are not successful, if we continue the same old, same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big-money interests, nothing changes.
1.0	0.661419501867	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.

0.0	0.375848612598	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.477460570416	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.428932026965	Martha -- I would just repeat that --
0.0	0.389198001854	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.280915688009	It's hate action.
0.0	0.273829662704	I'll keep -- I'll keep heading in that direction, believe me.
0.0	0.415143855695	And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that.
0.0	0.434752489218	What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger.

0.0	0.379552278409	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.444891586417	If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W.

0.0	0.418163000696	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.

0.0	0.293955638525	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.508395036291	We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.
0.0	0.3702509229	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.394256302768	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.341019429607	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.411357600199	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.243600850523	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.289829528107	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.447474598526	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.398268684151	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.293379498127	Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.
0.0	0.312223836715	I win.
0.0	0.326704122471	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.470411390987	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.

0.0	0.421500045086	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.472781230895	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.286468483952	All right.
0.0	0.456145401788	And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't.
0.0	0.251227259464	What are you going to do for my kids?
0.0	0.410287557767	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.394668503913	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.456780101985	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.192821783553	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?

0.0	0.168648285041	They think they are.
0.0	0.504355459376	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.268172432699	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.506032296074	Now, this takes, David, 18 months to 24 months, two years.
0.0	0.51515187389	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
0.0	0.173225807967	Look--
0.0	0.236641134013	Let it be for everybody.

0.0	0.347480131926	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.

0.0	0.405584617591	You can go to opensecrets.org and check that.
1.0	0.631947362057	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.481520442876	Just for the record.
0.0	0.500867748221	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.462194724435	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.385900151653	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.414520615708	So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out.
0.0	0.380901001254	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.405170600292	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.
0.0	0.546332373096	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.363751459284	That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
0.0	0.343164555949	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.41420340326	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.405769064726	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.431041170779	I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.
0.0	0.349306061873	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.
0.0	0.360980119864	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.433608367033	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.530383788394	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.445725741849	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.267118484398	And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college.
0.0	0.306374130136	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
0.0	0.325286552564	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.386464652851	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.403804449023	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.383136254417	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.43343123474	They beat us all the time.
0.0	0.346011295176	And it's impossible for our people here to compete.
0.0	0.0	But it will be...
0.0	0.486753898873	Bill.
0.0	0.265732350842	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.328162912427	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.341612934298	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.355915334042	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.46188128071	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.463812710314	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.353091719624	Yeah (ph), no, I think that's a -- that's a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques.
0.0	0.369732239228	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.437634392984	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.474105499748	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.362322063511	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.308845902089	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
1.0	0.415890300127	I didn't have an involvement with them.
1.0	0.567924492914	And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent.
0.0	0.323925742366	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.355356434432	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.432659271571	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.53918876274	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.454053113332	We can triple the border patrol.
0.0	0.371384006165	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.462992084108	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.329418030766	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.541024593478	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.348949877084	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.346426461145	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.34745254059	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
0.0	0.38151928866	So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.
0.0	0.455213895008	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.
0.0	0.389718274734	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.388065669675	Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody.
0.0	0.332688423874	I don't care.
0.0	0.478499376145	They are anxious on a number of levels.
0.0	0.40560974398	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
0.0	0.419531224117	As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.
0.0	0.462642000096	There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.
0.0	0.363189264308	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.488154016512	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.301595894659	And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
0.0	0.49725038907	I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money.
0.0	0.311976969888	Somebody said, "Oh, that's crass."
0.0	0.432475115557	When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it.
0.0	0.430197805931	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.495078777157	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.346872598691	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.405049749005	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
0.0	0.387402428331	I've prosecuted terrorists.
0.0	0.381308276833	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.354636935107	He's a bad negotiator.
0.0	0.435034226808	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.446331407107	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.
0.0	0.378788760028	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.354760753363	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.455324905992	The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.
0.0	0.478973732999	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.281239394925	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.16893410851	That's really nice.
0.0	0.379743799397	Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging.
0.0	0.496542836444	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...
0.0	0.404603993658	Well, thanks for having me.
1.0	0.556440594025	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.329936281512	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.413611838759	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.328976083673	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.460602927535	I'm meeting with three of them in the next week.
0.0	0.414823158325	People have invested a lot of energy into that.
0.0	0.328210076577	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.409154752136	I guess the one I -- I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after Bin Laden.
0.0	0.19118131777	They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
0.0	0.355679531811	Martha, if I may...
0.0	0.396509832016	Our vets have been abandoned.
0.0	0.506524253698	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.32254059045	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.361051099475	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.296385517988	Jared (ph), Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family.
1.0	0.552364200223	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.402237021019	I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie.
0.0	0.431169406029	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
0.0	0.282518593644	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
0.0	0.463222067937	What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people.
0.0	0.394414099245	Your question was you have disagreed...
0.0	0.410975657735	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.355922194075	Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer.
0.0	0.286468483952	Right.
0.0	0.360951332905	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
0.0	0.537729356604	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.299057637726	I'd suggest people take a look at it.
0.0	0.422903926794	And the world, no doubt is a better place without him.
0.0	0.298739068074	And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.
0.0	0.363496685717	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.355507843005	... Chris, your questions that you...
0.0	0.413219545286	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.46866532827	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.311308684781	She never lived to see that.
0.0	0.391441601514	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.331486125417	And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.
0.0	0.447597121948	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.205804661458	I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
0.0	0.365714164057	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.378255350862	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.517658651169	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.321872626149	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.334874213722	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.379718441135	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.4462125807	After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the -- the donors and by the lobbyists -- and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero -- I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford.
0.0	0.429446241912	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.370834682341	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.439482577417	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.399843333295	So Ford will come back.
0.0	0.256246954848	So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do.
0.0	0.301034920644	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.333895298922	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.390157234571	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.472692479531	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.395144803974	So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
0.0	0.418804065828	John, the world is a very dangerous place, but the world is not too dangerous of a place for the United States of America, provided we act according to our principles, provided we act intelligently.
0.0	0.376420968483	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
0.0	0.420694532361	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.330365640864	David, let me give you a little bit of background here.
0.0	0.221496480003	Oh, great.
0.0	0.464770057043	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.270809946347	He's wrong.
0.0	0.287016621424	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.
0.0	0.404650725506	And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...
0.0	0.296229756392	Go ahead.
0.0	0.478253083226	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.307790012744	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.313710264021	So Hillary and I have a difference.
0.0	0.591414559375	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
0.0	0.559404687004	You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.43601008323	In terms of Wall Street, I respectfully disagree with you, madam secretary, in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth.
0.0	0.434400191501	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.380062686458	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.440624166558	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.287714493688	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.404689452015	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.270389298347	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.374150262531	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
0.0	0.505051967926	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.338686550198	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.50180188741	In fact, American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the National Institute of Health and that we then tested through the FDA.
0.0	0.330246608647	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.406064337199	I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.
0.0	0.504880482471	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.375519665661	And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.
0.0	0.168648285041	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.353313880389	You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that.
0.0	0.32630411959	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.360226264197	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.35347899867	And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.
0.0	0.212297631697	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.312758150824	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.389446679004	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.31976935879	... do I go -- let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.41558718558	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.322085253456	And I think that's the false choice...
0.0	0.440966931137	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.307413335944	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.367258248362	The people don't work for us.
0.0	0.25651069629	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.322352079508	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.419718920796	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.336271006127	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.422327903261	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.539145008432	And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.351612314761	And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives.
1.0	0.620543456729	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.415345790084	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.449659481459	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.396510938728	But the facts are simple.
0.0	0.353966374328	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.380916785774	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.268645592316	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.354021045502	Whoever heard of this?
0.0	0.419845999415	Let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.481921899469	We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York.
0.0	0.462662171334	... family leave for a very long time...
0.0	0.292561770529	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.352433328176	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.323511263308	They are going to have to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.0	It is.
0.0	0.353348549298	It's coming from more than Mexico.
0.0	0.465038772787	And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.372611940135	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.367787464059	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.419661997624	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.410892430922	I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.
0.0	0.261274044423	That is why we need to make...
0.0	0.307940410116	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.387231320751	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.384227097168	We don't have victories anymore.
0.0	0.455600281474	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.395510622983	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.342564954251	I like how you stand up.
0.0	0.422889721678	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.470318428134	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.45427947483	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
1.0	0.660524735175	And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph).
1.0	0.655008500114	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.359863661981	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
0.0	0.430332455071	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.443894083215	John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL, and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening.
0.0	0.346385836758	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.34633477027	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.407875380994	How does that help us?  TRUMP R 15 94 1 N Where is that good?
0.0	0.351290101007	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.431270563322	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.490707247533	On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center.
0.0	0.288045406063	Barack Obama wants to change America.
0.0	0.361207913009	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.588300577143	We're spending over $600 billion a year on the military and yet, significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism.
0.0	0.446170360652	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.385145633813	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.457752605243	But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything.
0.0	0.391932620956	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
0.0	0.420817938205	We need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table.
0.0	0.484635554508	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.354809676021	They like to ask direct questions.
0.0	0.432341689545	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.360231340717	That can be done without profiling people.
0.0	0.614185975478	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.479949088017	My patients are beside themselves.
0.0	0.490613344247	It's a divided country on guns.
0.0	0.430247462732	We overcame the NRA's objections.
0.0	0.291612293809	They've got nothing but money.
0.0	0.4125487473	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.287427641586	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.438584315283	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.368192005402	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
0.0	0.268819620612	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.355901327019	And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.
0.0	0.314571707169	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.375368123288	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.431033626967	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.319309986213	Might I respond?
0.0	0.387921238687	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.

0.0	0.34364045991	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.
0.0	0.47229892579	I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
0.0	0.363077827335	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.457340156632	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.432318025951	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.67449022392	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.454812355741	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.481148681823	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.287516515223	We need more principle.
0.0	0.471907844341	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.471179074817	So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
0.0	0.360717854677	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.35287385816	Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
0.0	0.532931583476	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.3718701253	And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in.
1.0	0.506889639048	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.386539886896	We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be -- and -- and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody.
1.0	0.715787511547	The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation.
0.0	0.346864806273	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.447780116613	First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, "they cannot have it all."
0.0	0.405234496524	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.39848510063	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.367835341717	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.497738429174	At the end of the day, if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities.
0.0	0.377933288347	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.434893951216	And I was determined to do everything that I could to make VA health care the best in the world, to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending.
0.0	0.472594467259	A brief response.
0.0	0.363788278699	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.431557809302	Germany, many other countries do it already.
0.0	0.471697901721	We both made the identical promises.
0.0	0.369540136319	Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
0.0	0.371753510586	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.413485515716	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.437878675149	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.420537364283	Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks -- between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance.
0.0	0.422973364495	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.352870888509	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.503946117017	Number one...
0.0	0.422751841138	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.438654507708	When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal?
0.0	0.503542721025	We've enacted it in our state.
0.0	0.217322548333	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.37735632017	You know why three?
0.0	0.393021597425	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.422767908248	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.294196656483	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.423647295171	And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young, old, everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard.
0.0	0.456081195411	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.560923671025	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.358207962128	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.318314061475	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.3717446132	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.
0.0	0.346702990909	... and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.342194700536	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.478695632053	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.416124519122	As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that.
0.0	0.402689483446	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
0.0	0.509585680058	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
1.0	0.72162591017	The average middle-class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.493057915619	They all have jobs.
0.0	0.352384275893	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.514439552134	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.307236998133	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.293679702083	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.454472238552	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.256745409167	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.347769889627	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.404656008938	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.412899937223	And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.
0.0	0.457473954758	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.414195035012	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.536426684432	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.404999599378	My background is different.
0.0	0.249044651876	You're right.
0.0	0.494417517288	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.4255028378	I want this bill to be voted down.
0.0	0.435236667081	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.429952868697	That is some group of people.
0.0	0.352844594606	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.498774910041	So as a nation we need to increase what we invest in Pell grants.
0.0	0.35410507858	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.430617412918	And I wrote a book about this called Immigration Wars.
0.0	0.435373590967	We have people that have no incentive to work.
0.0	0.292688265677	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.53227545757	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.479496784123	I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...
0.0	0.274031062546	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
0.0	0.411858792768	They come up to my office.
0.0	0.339579871947	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
1.0	0.592661619655	What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons.
0.0	0.398580489654	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.286468483952	All right.
0.0	0.47835605994	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.336462162993	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.491449512286	States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government.
0.0	0.524072633475	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.372078574505	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.522476388736	People have been paying it for years.
0.0	0.168648285041	I think what is...
0.0	0.369238760993	I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.
0.0	0.488646020068	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.235089913374	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.398295058867	So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has.
0.0	0.490622078592	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
0.0	0.438965363164	And that's what we have= representing us.
0.0	0.49548408002	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.379609251697	We have the U.N. Security Council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path.
0.0	0.0	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.378350514714	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.433695986014	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.522208517729	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.270860497223	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.353140022274	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.258006569184	I've gotten to do some incredible things.
0.0	0.544464530226	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
0.0	0.367765547592	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.341467793682	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.455698478467	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.377378314919	We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt.
0.0	0.397635808719	We should make women third-class citizens, that we should allow children to be sexually assaulted, that they are a danger to modern society.
0.0	0.335999196923	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.394596217629	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.274873053885	Please reconsider, I'll say no.
0.0	0.546969110953	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.447841942083	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.462571290498	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
1.0	0.637862618617	But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.
0.0	0.359784042387	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.36135644904	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.443746020615	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.380619263683	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.479194356617	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.377100757787	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.461970596904	In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, "Donald, you don't have enough borrowings.
0.0	0.386476110532	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.312726332659	But you don't hear that from anybody else.
0.0	0.307414922609	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.211368238301	You get a lot of them that are overrated.
0.0	0.425439297772	We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party.
0.0	0.34439749138	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.337555959145	So I said, "That's OK." I'm proud of my net worth.
0.0	0.370150428767	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.491835695417	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.497995376849	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.405733298571	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.506710129207	We haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.
0.0	0.337989414846	Let me just...
0.0	0.487174359527	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.463041859726	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...
0.0	0.463821047449	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.414352180634	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.307390728981	And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.
0.0	0.269658609619	We want to build on it and fix it.
0.0	0.187629452627	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.247886117213	I think I'm actually a very nice person."
0.0	0.439515848354	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.335629865979	May I respond?
0.0	0.399226757134	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.43031099986	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.44602726943	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.401514960355	Secretary Clinton is right.
0.0	0.463371353541	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.42256475412	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.464731185983	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.584696987542	I want the Buffett Rule to be in effect, where millionaires have to pay 30 percent tax rates instead of 10 percent to nothing in some cases.
0.0	0.249337530195	I will be ready.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.437951741987	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.370308407717	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.399169443937	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
0.0	0.389913835139	So, yes, this has developed.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	1.0	I never said that.
1.0	0.667021031059	And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.298330964134	That's the difference.
0.0	0.493916011232	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.354975998966	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.490312861308	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.430867531538	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.363527956329	What a brilliant idea that would be.
0.0	0.318213645569	What have you got now?
0.0	0.370681936418	He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots.
0.0	0.348286989459	I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries.
0.0	0.45879529205	I've spent my entire life, since I started as a young lawyer for the Children's Defense Fund, trying to figure out how we can even the odds for so many people in America, this great country of ours, who are behind, who don't have a chance.
0.0	0.333961036272	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
0.0	0.494023986421	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.318509615818	I have a wonderful family.
0.0	0.434113529406	And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.
0.0	0.372566357021	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.446891007698	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.354286461024	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.439790556734	He's actually a negative force.
0.0	0.376075099461	They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists.
0.0	0.346021261936	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
0.0	0.304686347093	Now, I understand that this is very difficult.
0.0	0.393371342942	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.412124584024	And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.
0.0	0.462876724404	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.323628966216	He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing?
0.0	0.168648285041	Think about that.
0.0	0.285639965391	I think we all support that.
0.0	0.443687401705	And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
0.0	0.38552531978	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.351932452215	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.476144598086	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.315272654785	There's give and take.
0.0	0.471594185287	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.529973778314	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
0.0	0.383872563217	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.404270110994	The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.
1.0	0.546512071156	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.489502468485	And also -- also, what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health care outcomes are not necessarily that good.
0.0	0.391077493735	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.446186282347	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.345369462575	No, John.
0.0	0.185083630655	Yeah.
0.0	0.429619795773	... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.380026778942	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.392862480012	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.457791824613	So I believe that over the next few years, not tomorrow, but over the next few years, we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.310406367272	They're killing us.
0.0	0.410840838838	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.321332712833	David, thank you.
0.0	0.290323652147	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.361913127511	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.465621342024	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.252028049802	You know, the situation is this.
1.0	0.616878425156	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.404178518928	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.38657600957	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.305651272312	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.346030756408	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.506285850074	There is no money in the Social Security account.
1.0	0.805414870693	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.437992848588	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.
0.0	0.341295087045	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.338454240117	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.355574871326	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.39168874032	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.396710001322	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
1.0	0.492936299736	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.392003890845	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.403287726391	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.48060760705	When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it.
0.0	0.268591318353	Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.
0.0	0.36234023792	Then I looked at Rubio.
0.0	0.295081120982	I said, "I don't know."
0.0	0.281995493407	Well, I think it's pretty clear that they know that I will.
0.0	0.4569047775	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.432606945715	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.308216161816	And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.
0.0	0.345114052245	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.230635838893	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.403196334739	You can't hide behind parliamentary tricks.
1.0	0.628096925281	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.452893664601	And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details.
0.0	0.463375837328	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.337989414846	Let me just...
0.0	0.37837902835	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.439465720293	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.462493257804	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.277533821971	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.39232899771	... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience.
0.0	0.401447228638	And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.
1.0	0.639469147435	In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship.
0.0	0.47215982658	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.309343974616	They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it.
0.0	0.502279223557	We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally.
0.0	0.363353001064	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.444944744099	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.480164949624	And so do I.
0.0	0.381168851402	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.229992657281	Talk about what?
0.0	0.391295688669	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.462785295875	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.485829047928	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
1.0	0.499935852487	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.374376419321	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.410106984488	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.327420555547	Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem.
0.0	0.371138162489	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.384932201793	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.460929318279	Drugs have taken far too many of our citizens.
0.0	0.406000715571	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.37705845406	And we also need a cheerleader.
0.0	0.495630582347	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.310639166985	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.29598013477	We have nothing.
0.0	0.408073480963	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.311833609455	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.37871653025	The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
0.0	0.42263605862	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.4131003504	this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.
0.0	0.414113754463	First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.309241144899	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.407651228226	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.391213144824	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.0	And why?
0.0	0.296008178907	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.295255540064	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.460289451972	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.208178699968	So you know what?
0.0	0.412826451209	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.367989983014	But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go.
0.0	0.326965659451	Enough said.
0.0	0.302816442288	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.508837655224	Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS.
0.0	0.340413555738	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.422104106652	So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years -- you know, we're at $8 trillion now.
0.0	0.337640003458	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.369743201943	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.421860193753	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.537110128147	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.365638172232	I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination.
1.0	0.677871877228	We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.
0.0	0.442362113914	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.352401688491	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.
0.0	0.407080478565	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.419411454124	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.
0.0	0.286918786747	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.445121428224	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.227418222088	I'll say this.
0.0	0.377369007472	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.292386444778	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.362524640655	He's a progressive economist.
1.0	0.581333413081	In fact, wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century, after my husband's administration.
0.0	0.45482729415	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.480547575088	You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet...
0.0	0.440389020561	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.248246582432	I tell you that.
0.0	0.331265377366	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.456380262444	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.305955490855	All of that together, we're going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.
0.0	0.319693700897	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.225407298301	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.184780324866	I happen to think...
0.0	0.422375668997	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.35631889786	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
1.0	0.560575098673	I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.
0.0	0.364763577264	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.237483131869	Okay, thank you.
0.0	0.362517248092	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.517916193222	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...
0.0	0.335534690972	And we are not England.
0.0	0.229049916365	And that's what's happening.
0.0	0.278996661183	We get a traitor.
0.0	0.489868582854	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.429560069995	And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, "if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed.
0.0	0.456742451677	In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...
0.0	0.307401169275	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.286885581026	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.294647231054	I do and this is an important issue and I know we'll get to a lot of other critical ones as well.
0.0	0.272877440552	I would not want to go to that point.
0.0	0.620102719366	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.259155705945	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.706727071876	$24 trillion.
0.0	0.422408974339	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.374033052983	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.228835496768	Sorry.
0.0	0.374343510124	That's the future of banking in America.
0.0	0.237930044408	I agree with that.
0.0	0.589505594192	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.433509465653	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.477047765478	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.425976045735	But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
0.0	0.370675810956	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.353901322216	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.314211573177	We know about the French.
0.0	0.302383821006	They don't know how to bring it about.
0.0	0.329380859969	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.404655918652	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.429402470378	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.374937373468	I'll give you another example.
0.0	0.482324123553	And second of all...
0.0	0.478837691538	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.307422208095	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.287448075984	That's not fair.
0.0	0.322910860568	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.286876077773	Let's be frank here.
0.0	0.304516250812	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.311687741049	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.284266772476	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.431599416843	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.413285532502	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.460914788651	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.45372121832	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.217433144949	And guess what?
0.0	0.491817388873	They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?
0.0	0.497111983997	Against the Republican leadership, who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies.
0.0	0.314609907121	That's when we become Greece.
0.0	0.445432544567	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.
0.0	0.387823763768	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
0.0	0.371796136161	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.0	So...
0.0	0.251380852227	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.449828953677	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.328867002657	As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans.
0.0	0.304800553645	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.306666449291	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.361923452907	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.415901545573	And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues.
0.0	0.362640356289	I would just...
0.0	0.385705930132	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.62234402166	But you would index it -- you would index it to the median wage.
0.0	0.299091345268	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.35217807057	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.462777058554	Then (inaudible)...
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.280374200301	They're a scam.
0.0	0.259966859854	He didn't know.
0.0	0.287213615034	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.477693830442	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
0.0	0.52193649359	I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war.
0.0	0.37012076538	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.385934215698	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.278823494983	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.4058014166	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.358545946814	So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.
0.0	0.631084424696	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.393467530306	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.388999513852	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.308743096359	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
1.0	0.492024585738	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
1.0	0.498725367963	Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees -- these are big vehicles -- were left behind for the enemy.
0.0	0.472227908893	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
0.0	0.496033158207	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.349503462063	What our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as Americans.
1.0	0.682086064405	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.
0.0	0.305185295713	So it is difficult.
0.0	0.359230098706	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
0.0	0.477201489757	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.41357866707	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.295542610811	I am glad Donald is running.
0.0	0.304034748477	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
1.0	0.585499324954	They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
0.0	0.312247228088	Chris?
0.0	0.46386228823	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.44744090749	I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.488799447966	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
0.0	0.342750194154	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.430060486469	We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it.
0.0	0.301401606519	Oh, yes there is.
0.0	0.331591494684	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.587595031535	And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.482449476431	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.380174608272	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
0.0	0.480373940651	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.493317580149	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	1.0	It's not true.
1.0	0.595898239524	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.420895086853	My point is this.
0.0	0.329908656551	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.189763881386	We have to do something.
0.0	0.325575719377	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.
0.0	0.5121494503	But at the end of the day, what you have right now are millions of Americans working two or three jobs because their wages that they are earning are just too low.
0.0	0.435728020604	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.437262643556	That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.
0.0	0.369820050654	If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say?
0.0	0.446463658626	All the time.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.462648611464	Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people.
0.0	0.352654863878	It's not working.
0.0	0.582663579952	I sell apartments for -- I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.
0.0	0.372223371434	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.428988818164	I do agree that in particular, Turkey and the Gulf nations have got to make up their minds.
0.0	0.386406735232	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.271013234726	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.41045591998	So the reporter said to me the other day, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person.
0.0	0.272059832984	Somebody said -- thank you, darlin'.
0.0	0.270809946347	He's wrong.
0.0	0.371246364794	Where were we attacked?
0.0	1.0	Of course.
0.0	0.39961927815	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.403230142885	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.428896358583	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.530269095206	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.274926923106	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	1.0	I never said that.
0.0	0.357173584706	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.385954632395	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.250833465123	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.254106949608	I don't think it's gonna happen.
0.0	0.413745252327	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.365264260128	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.50733372325	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.413213395575	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.393151378435	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.350498747528	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.429126601926	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.316247342797	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.228315228567	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.370108649553	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.35282223178	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.3644793608	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.39956099988	You're seeing cities like San Francisco, cities like Los Angeles doing it, and they are doing it well and workers are able to have more disposable income.
0.0	0.423000094773	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.36357704687	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.519017715387	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.208178699968	I know.
0.0	0.537244542726	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.504229619705	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.387612045569	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.457809553698	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.382556579101	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.496405335508	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.396865779095	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.422151939473	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.344605489293	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.342814011195	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
0.0	0.50742251535	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.428931820005	I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done.
0.0	0.463305638629	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.462202293638	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.322766213592	And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous.
0.0	0.418687837286	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.351118836555	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.310776018681	You can go to my website...
0.0	0.442741027216	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.363013548861	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.393946686223	But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone.
0.0	0.301311278498	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.336977533687	If I was president, I'd say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.288024298847	Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.
0.0	0.287837773955	I love China.
0.0	0.283673042169	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.344090175773	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.410120965655	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.430611288036	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.474131758356	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.432533885815	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.351572076064	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.
0.0	0.378200768361	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.376171772384	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.437806880512	My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.
0.0	0.220125186327	They knew that.
0.0	0.436017256293	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
1.0	0.513451438693	I did introduce legislation to reign in compensation.
0.0	0.412281778925	In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston.
0.0	0.289533723794	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.396522974534	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.350757811762	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.548291490118	Close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole and...
0.0	0.365508083744	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
0.0	0.422218453848	Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength.
0.0	0.360676013486	They can't lead us.
0.0	0.437614437703	And she turned around many lives.
0.0	0.386008324336	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.286468483952	That's not right.
0.0	0.284731738423	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.446941963636	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.457787619731	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.368603458506	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.472655654932	Those hedge funds.
0.0	0.481844011079	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
1.0	0.613945639646	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.268827647768	And I believe he is absolutely right.
0.0	0.409554083357	And, also, acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration, and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners.
0.0	0.349616689989	I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.258373267584	And they're wonderful people.
0.0	0.470212563633	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
0.0	0.303570933058	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.437406028188	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.47199786536	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.389190187332	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.304270070667	I think there is a consensus.
0.0	0.286468483952	Right.
0.0	0.339071062979	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.338454240117	We actually did it.
0.0	0.477510219657	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.484230758046	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.497233235321	When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
0.0	0.20394273117	OK, good.
0.0	0.489921119285	A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.
0.0	0.667716978105	He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration.
0.0	0.395600104892	Washington is broken.
0.0	0.319511396359	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.19219225577	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.342070177599	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.486384939333	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.362227215808	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.354139884428	... but wait a minute...
0.0	0.484797405687	We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.
0.0	0.362696499536	Thank you very, very much.
0.0	0.437315971434	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.302757673194	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.208178699968	You know why?
0.0	0.45684797985	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.321058141019	Look, I served on...
0.0	0.297713573728	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.314643644853	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.472178432813	And if they have to be in the Middle East for 20 or 30 years no problem.
0.0	0.430543287207	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.324944028528	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.342731935903	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.196249237994	Whoa.
0.0	0.411785649628	They have to be alert to problems.
0.0	0.414849223039	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.409690703559	... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.456136760908	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.39180492893	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
0.0	0.0	That's what it is.
0.0	0.41162478503	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.2108001187	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.511594746842	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.499477495713	So it's unfair to say in total...
0.0	0.457725742114	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.451113307907	They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
0.0	0.499563355946	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.452309706593	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.294394928209	But not for us.
0.0	0.495828441675	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.309073655669	They're sending us not the right people.
0.0	0.4718855365	He's been a negative force.
0.0	0.493406182705	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
1.0	0.521870824747	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.365010700884	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.
0.0	0.333823317924	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
1.0	0.35363313814	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.357017437609	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.262986421886	...the only reason is -- look...
0.0	0.422471472126	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.4498869406	So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
0.0	0.335388042692	The Obama administration.
0.0	0.39983445051	So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.
0.0	0.28793631419	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.357222095529	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.393872621668	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.42657055477	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.385975322924	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.430063524684	We can have debt-free college in the United States.
0.0	0.336477007024	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.537346976328	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.332009331906	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.378904667492	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.403207207365	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
1.0	0.648389068731	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
0.0	0.404264583756	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.416265426711	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.17792479855	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.624323479703	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.44661395621	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.458762117161	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
1.0	0.607849705604	7 percent and 8 percent to go to college?
0.0	0.627022105571	Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.
0.0	0.369679740757	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.3978562606	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.221715895587	No, I love them.
0.0	0.487492854153	What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS.
0.0	0.0	It's not.
0.0	0.445941218438	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
0.0	0.564589648317	And he also had no trouble appointing an investment banker to be in charge of his consumer protection bureau when he was governor.
0.0	0.370642455762	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.327390598908	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.371210938306	Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough.
0.0	0.542165517796	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.561985222966	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.475811119161	We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.
0.0	0.324586303453	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.368342800996	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.360747758413	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.409004697901	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.447849486094	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.27266258383	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.453462433802	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.486443290869	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.414301483594	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.41320700461	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.41386264081	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.422474494492	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.463615395816	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.433019075292	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.376977433337	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.439302890226	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.389500292757	They are not doing it now.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.360967308958	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.436939911388	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.51421836819	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
1.0	0.626416361815	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
0.0	0.444502813324	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.

0.0	0.385165177178	And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
0.0	0.439024517483	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.

0.0	0.40335195286	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.403993416833	They would like to rip it up and start all over again, throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now.
0.0	0.363197033151	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.41209272204	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.

0.0	0.445253146042	I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war.
0.0	0.458947227188	You opposed him then.

1.0	0.702768238179	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.398046512034	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.
0.0	0.439238417984	This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.

0.0	0.393558733002	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.188716547961	OK?
0.0	0.343800033383	And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.
0.0	0.314373632555	It's what they call it.
0.0	0.309721370971	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.188716547961	OK?
0.0	0.470566940324	Here's my second problem.

0.0	0.469947226163	In this building, in Trump Tower.
0.0	0.421346631647	And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow.
0.0	0.345160327605	You bet they do.
0.0	0.548306432863	What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security, through the State Department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening.
0.0	0.437244303383	We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground."
0.0	0.425742195767	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.429302021182	And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.

0.0	0.322318876911	Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen?
0.0	0.370862874397	And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party, but of President Obama.
0.0	0.306755363245	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.351858143802	So we need people -- I'm a free trader.
0.0	1.0	That's true.
0.0	0.447716817417	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.300835937344	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.428472358107	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.453912358707	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.563635333509	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.45910021842	So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.
0.0	0.342629125265	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.421383340808	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.345743917039	We are rebuilding China.

0.0	0.312868712135	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.439818983484	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.407388842548	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.450648831255	Well, I'm kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time.
0.0	0.363687482617	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.429404824962	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.
0.0	0.415353515457	When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war.
0.0	0.37161160978	Let's reverse the immunity.

0.0	0.462337319546	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.365141253311	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
1.0	0.541947240375	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.469841832512	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.574894340014	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.430149165854	We ought to send used equipment, right?
0.0	0.268783353304	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.386697614701	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.290741919611	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.479490563789	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.435698047736	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.411016668979	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.343126154211	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.249764256106	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.422028154125	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.364404659771	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.421504718909	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.504019645469	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.333424796123	If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration.
0.0	0.502485714788	ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.
0.0	0.466363789526	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.343542825363	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.420942162266	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
0.0	0.444724495109	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.547689812542	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.432265181835	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.380906248352	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.185083630655	Yeah.
0.0	0.386004643802	Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.453037051689	And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.
0.0	0.386155001974	And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave.
0.0	0.382873532201	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.288923036036	Are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not?
0.0	0.328390270015	That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities.
0.0	0.497969009448	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.415905359607	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.29245472901	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.391453010742	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.211781121215	Sure did.
0.0	0.460653611511	And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said.
0.0	0.41094902578	That's what I understand is the request from the international...
0.0	0.424535091186	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.344324669196	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.303005932853	That makes no sense at all.
0.0	0.453650507973	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.445172959842	We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be -- we ought to send our surplus.
0.0	0.523114128907	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.50655791104	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.486753898873	That's my bill.
0.0	0.484757408832	I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border."
0.0	0.26859450207	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.601501204921	We end up paying the highest prices in the world.
0.0	0.354139884428	Wait a minute.
0.0	0.338454240117	We actually did it.
0.0	0.395921786432	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.421080045956	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.448150724054	Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.
0.0	0.355207323025	From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made.
0.0	0.356219928304	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.412575839225	He's not arming the Kurds.
0.0	0.250734544826	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.537838252337	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.415018741946	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.439110972822	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.332050627118	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.372407522561	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.290293738561	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.386491950477	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.467069005112	Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor.
0.0	0.284774096006	And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.
0.0	0.413939891511	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.353914997274	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.379338197212	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.335026245844	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.
0.0	0.354646446541	Does my family like me?
0.0	0.269500013851	We must anticipate these threats before they happen.
0.0	0.389499557337	And when he moved on his own people, threatening a massacre, genocide, the Europeans and the Arabs, our allies and partners, did ask for American help and we provided it.
0.0	0.15273685012	They're great.
0.0	0.430100017065	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.337740421547	Syria is a mess.
0.0	0.464852973644	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.339051520058	I heard what they said.
0.0	0.429547291349	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.462773223541	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.504680331658	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.364087759171	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.709766650497	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.562425196082	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.4620567835	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.387808059001	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.368945981475	So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.
0.0	0.416201490027	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.454973478291	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.303903107308	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.405557096005	That's what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I'm proud that they're supporting my campaign.
0.0	0.409680161416	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.355083383681	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.566075423886	And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.
0.0	0.512937245188	More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows.
0.0	0.454150836977	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.36326159029	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.
0.0	0.448135253688	I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place.
0.0	0.411983092335	You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911.
0.0	0.329314184524	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.531345086018	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.55413586645	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.329705897419	Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
0.0	0.319693700897	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.454966371798	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.
0.0	0.268973532889	We know about the Brits.
0.0	0.350653727894	I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.
0.0	0.387084306826	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.421894390788	You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes.
0.0	0.478486008749	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.431113707599	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.269991465829	It feels different.
0.0	0.403797346229	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.390611469529	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.456040788976	That is our government today.
0.0	0.247810279039	That is important.
0.0	0.314600817192	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.445623361161	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.347450580702	I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.
0.0	0.338116935223	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.527365725219	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.591103277666	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.320956354291	So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.
0.0	0.45889146322	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.330180925466	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.401335431402	And we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.
0.0	0.476373485202	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.37347305908	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.415184729242	And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence.
0.0	0.363611321882	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.312247228088	Chris...
0.0	0.237134909764	We're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.370812627875	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.440502785507	And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.344676730218	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.392667821115	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.478358158472	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.402421346695	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.0	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.370873316226	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.41309786684	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.378379467043	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.409511061321	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.359293796327	You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.
0.0	0.40481504874	But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.
0.0	0.286957188947	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.422362340515	I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country.
0.0	0.351391712662	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
1.0	0.523379518803	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.342703411621	And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it.
0.0	0.40527551321	If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.
0.0	0.412126577967	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.362775609913	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.421634189426	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.335944820195	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.328936249111	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
1.0	0.45437711514	The 500,000 who came home with PTSD, and traumatic brain injury.
0.0	0.338684211927	Divide that out.
0.0	0.441080042959	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.363083299345	We don't need more of the same solutions.
0.0	0.438428407625	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.0	Excuse me, no.
0.0	0.387610661585	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.398032954596	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.388613050023	So I believe that, in fact, this country needs to move towards a living wage.
0.0	0.462909774568	And we ought to fight them on that level.
1.0	0.468946484934	You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small.
0.0	0.479106888751	And so, look, the way that -- a stronger middle class is actually the source of economic growth.
0.0	0.346869482366	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.481550348477	I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
0.0	0.453215595878	So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating, but the highest median income in America.
1.0	0.595804173957	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.184474938427	Yes, I'm getting...
0.0	0.447621558167	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.
0.0	0.405014446755	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
1.0	0.698824214357	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.57357357296	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.320009233464	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.362739813882	You can't be in favor of defend us...
0.0	0.357968995665	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.480577640308	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.388918203103	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.34503522726	There are hundreds of things like that.
0.0	0.346459315315	Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home.
0.0	0.444128437005	Kathie, this was not merely theory in Maryland.
0.0	0.409186341291	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.455776738513	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.529745490393	ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries.
0.0	0.414181247743	I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.

0.0	0.433746577643	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.607846125238	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
1.0	0.470777460422	And the overall message is that it doesn't result in job loss.
0.0	0.360738164147	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.

0.0	0.0	Why is that?
0.0	0.483243328379	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.302433548042	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.

0.0	0.448468207504	And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.
0.0	0.459537382429	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.

0.0	0.44887165968	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.359456808744	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.418133213581	We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation.
0.0	0.289717251766	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.199696042988	I'll take that, too.
1.0	0.691808074787	Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education.

0.0	0.413324256019	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.443637931106	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.23794526954	They're saying, "Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough."
0.0	0.370717342435	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.361091327481	I'm an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I miss doing eye surgery, still get to do a little bit.

0.0	0.0	You did.
0.0	0.442546472726	And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina, and many other Republican states, that because of their right wing political ideology, are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.3948157611	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.354194169246	But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.
0.0	0.329348036299	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.

0.0	0.419415388393	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.265816574124	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.350648871227	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.300082231478	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.477413321754	And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and I would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go.
0.0	0.387263754488	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.
0.0	0.359471503398	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.533941395972	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.38707073124	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.506056297701	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.343760144603	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.40598111977	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.397676029943	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.608905671021	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.480644723299	This country is changing.

0.0	0.242715578048	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.337478330252	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.315970519165	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.4740516174	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.402258441439	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.434043767861	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
1.0	0.278117643167	They're rapists.
0.0	0.463711709697	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.414050632665	Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.
0.0	0.367067190063	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.431473879136	This ties into campaign finance reform.
0.0	0.505981496093	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.427524582651	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.316769859763	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.414094352366	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.380138426985	It's a disaster.
0.0	0.23868283781	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.457356934392	Starting with our children and moving forward.
0.0	0.208178699968	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.359330830231	We're ready to start shooting."
0.0	0.286807361674	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.593037786105	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.536800518008	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.188235474309	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.354623168544	And, you know, I don't know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done.
0.0	0.438203481422	Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street.
1.0	0.610798315167	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.336420876644	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.328217562676	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.36908051984	She's an American citizen.
0.0	0.543622582219	... saying, no middle class tax raises.
0.0	0.440382089028	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.521985799036	Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product -- a sign of strength, right?
0.0	0.456610791749	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.358000848585	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.380138426985	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.307557114442	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.564474822437	No, both the federal and a state approach.

0.0	0.0	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.311343594479	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.379450787614	He is a good man.
0.0	0.304522174462	We have problems with Russia.
0.0	0.346869482366	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.347478553589	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.28519392291	... and I'd like to respond.
0.0	0.395546530179	It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.
0.0	0.430197805931	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.211699998154	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.395383467273	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.488190496456	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.490135574173	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.287617467102	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.421825178258	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.388336683132	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.336804128803	Now, our country needs -- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
0.0	0.335868693174	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.396226449156	I beat China all the time.
1.0	0.658742432347	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.554286469361	And universities.
0.0	0.318574761606	We now finally are where we need to be.
0.0	0.432162109559	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
0.0	0.337528734175	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
0.0	0.36637040631	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.

0.0	0.392332540646	It ain't complicated.
0.0	0.253329826788	I think we're at war with jihadists who have --
0.0	0.0	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.35916224626	And they don't know -- "Are you running?
0.0	0.387561478687	That's the big leagues.

0.0	0.64006463206	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.420737338069	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.531914178076	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.286468483952	That's not right.
0.0	0.208178699968	And you know what?
0.0	0.327106196474	I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.
0.0	0.430174221695	Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe.
0.0	0.382348392213	The no-fly zone, I would hope, would be also shared by Russia.
0.0	0.361723517781	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.404413106493	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.376798349741	Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."
0.0	0.4492733766	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.424612811949	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.410951179496	If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs.
0.0	0.380666221204	I was for legalization.

0.0	0.395160854056	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.396943423424	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.322708660812	We haven't.
0.0	0.253815960417	Please think of our founding fathers as you listen.
0.0	0.441492958501	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.289892194456	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.408802420398	Now, what the magic number is, I don't know, because we don't know the extent of the problem.
0.0	0.350631732665	We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.
0.0	0.469066600965	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
0.0	0.439763442441	I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
0.0	0.328621387216	There's a lot packed into that statement.
1.0	0.672046157597	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.351301904502	But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting.
0.0	0.300564362961	Can I just say this...
0.0	0.282304040218	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.464401592286	... people all over this country -- not you, Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other.
0.0	0.566424989749	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.314911293617	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.
0.0	0.395070649477	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.398102293015	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.440146228777	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.359881870201	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.495775104019	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.354965508743	What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy, and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need.
0.0	0.359414229224	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.529446140816	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.339060932317	Marco can change his mind.
0.0	0.480007318671	Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
0.0	0.387206964813	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.399042000716	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
0.0	0.505035434187	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.
0.0	0.395306459268	We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
0.0	0.48066515514	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.360992980883	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.270210030763	I don't think we're at war with Islam.
0.0	0.279326029899	Those are your enemies.
0.0	0.440893146262	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.404262538362	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.
0.0	0.301493191288	But look, we didn't know what was happening next.
0.0	0.260099771437	I can do that.
0.0	0.473994415279	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.499079364287	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.397869835037	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.395878785717	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.287558259962	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.322781221023	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.383018097672	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.40153803379	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.258853628775	And you have to really work hard at it.
0.0	0.245000837394	I understand.
1.0	0.732461862921	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.481265376807	They should have made it more open ended for the next president.
0.0	0.416874085391	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.
0.0	0.39644164614	As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
0.0	0.38549468596	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.318113454119	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.427901994543	And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't."
0.0	0.455134866138	When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.
0.0	0.345063641413	... And start taking advice...
0.0	0.521597050784	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
0.0	0.321357569063	She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.
0.0	0.458397936036	And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting.
0.0	0.474927292056	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.614185975478	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.35427279367	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.0	Have to do it.
0.0	0.433417735094	That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.
0.0	0.412860836474	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.
0.0	0.339791099625	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.435165681011	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.403477656317	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.408913929534	Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.
0.0	0.39469601143	I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security.
0.0	0.477633067003	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.480164949624	But I...
0.0	0.268679203769	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.399672131369	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.285042696183	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
0.0	0.321062297736	How the hell can you vote for this guy?
0.0	0.216941517206	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.507722032665	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.380724982592	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.376932956658	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.470805629987	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.210739678129	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.502311082676	Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.
0.0	0.315843919444	I want to take care of women.
1.0	0.345191078053	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.436887555202	Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day.
0.0	0.448581718251	I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
0.0	0.454010391409	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.538786886092	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.489077491189	The biggest bank in the world is from China.
0.0	0.341013511112	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.380138426985	It is a disaster.
0.0	0.208178699968	They know.
0.0	0.434981734407	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.396397085694	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.468188577943	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.379554585025	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.421693108525	And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation.
0.0	0.340701514382	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.428518012532	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.293495408762	Just get me a job.
0.0	0.294742390066	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.470737386439	Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.
0.0	0.311131105786	I said, "I don't need it.
0.0	0.428320853491	The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.
0.0	0.396306584681	There is a vacuum.
0.0	0.403131517665	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.43042591572	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.3947817331	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.426815070131	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.362306874255	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.454445329344	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.0	Both.
0.0	0.306482190686	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.407283514486	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.40236199746	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
1.0	0.48361021599	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.397140112159	Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us.
0.0	0.436613135293	He was on the board.
0.0	0.507159623673	Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
1.0	0.480556542506	We passed it after 9/11.
0.0	0.428246102208	People were shocked, Trump got it.
0.0	0.422979134272	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.245693897343	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.447083098133	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.440686267305	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.275303192501	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.516360005569	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.500913184198	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.160587263857	I'm ready.
0.0	0.384119604469	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.42337824507	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.44022209016	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.351779614124	We've got the consensus, what we're lacking is political leadership...
0.0	0.426016170539	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.420285378846	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.0	We do.
0.0	0.593297032055	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.413686872389	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.378433560388	If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
0.0	0.415171064779	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.447932199721	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
0.0	0.363989471587	Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that's not good enough.
0.0	0.168648285041	I think that is...
0.0	0.52331698694	Clearly the best piece of veterans' legislation brought forth in decades.
0.0	0.430083263137	Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint.
0.0	0.479164703641	It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.
0.0	0.413741894504	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
0.0	0.395713679421	And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.449018049282	When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up.
0.0	0.458445140197	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.387349082491	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.44548574491	Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.
1.0	0.638961393249	It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate.
0.0	0.379642339872	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.311678387146	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.603315436637	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.32477428196	Let's get rid of Assad later.
0.0	0.502621699992	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
1.0	0.318696797885	They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us.
0.0	0.543134790136	We have artificially low interest rates.
0.0	0.260212662208	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.309621770663	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.446271604613	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.262723428987	How are we gonna -- how are we gonna go back and make it great again?
0.0	0.298899792381	It's affordable for everybody.
0.0	0.426898118578	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.396239869305	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.
0.0	0.393821589468	But we came together.
0.0	0.317168168283	I'm tested.
0.0	0.393248826405	I've dealt with them all my life.

1.0	0.65198150054	Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.
0.0	0.410568781545	But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.
0.0	0.440331173192	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.270809946347	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.236728883473	Yeah, but let me respond...
0.0	0.229585536986	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.233103879039	I'm going to be independent.
0.0	0.473013328627	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.396907964186	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.523601023496	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.368530352497	We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear.
0.0	0.449554281041	My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, which sparked my interest in the need for immigration reform because I know what it's like to be the son of an immigrant.
0.0	0.45302116272	I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks.
0.0	0.309808159637	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.346444558585	We have to come together as a country.
0.0	0.352432443476	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.384437777071	But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.
0.0	0.423734446345	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.402660330133	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.208178699968	And you know what?
0.0	0.421290937601	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.311445196488	... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street.
1.0	0.54231260734	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.32942794939	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.0	We have to do it.
0.0	0.265318152102	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.

0.0	0.412916785023	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.420663306917	Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.407146186243	We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.

0.0	0.407294278932	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.413065069932	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.368426352925	Kevin, if I could just jump in.
0.0	0.454862398908	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.298266759714	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.343104604668	Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth.
0.0	0.402270296787	So let's move toward what we should be doing as a nation and follow the values of our immigration history and begin to make it possible for them to come out of the shadows and to have a future that gives them a full chance of citizenship.
0.0	0.406490060685	And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.
0.0	0.338393445976	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.489788019307	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.313519594823	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.337640003458	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.467434796174	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.312929081094	Let me just say this...
0.0	0.440206555577	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.0	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.436312739593	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.332660161707	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.412987474031	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.292887263511	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
0.0	0.400445954594	Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top.
0.0	0.351279941359	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.473241414844	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.274391562003	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.496144479235	The young officer who was killed responding to the Planned Parenthood murders.
1.0	0.489629361497	Twenty-one mass shootings, including one last weekend in Des Moins where three were murdered.
0.0	0.49530139607	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.342947118472	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.422784902245	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.430184279975	And, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like Gadhafi, a despot with American blood on his hands, is overturned.
0.0	0.280818254964	Can you believe this?
0.0	0.372165279344	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.330168420163	How stupid are our leaders?
0.0	0.367551262183	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.319267412735	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.306799530455	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.237582296852	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.351368058443	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.320797811155	... issues they have to respond to.
0.0	0.420801567641	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.464846318357	We expand Medicare to all people.
0.0	0.456867661235	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
1.0	0.472787291514	In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.
0.0	0.524206813761	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.395503136396	We went after those who had attacked us.
0.0	0.460871797267	In the 1980s, it was in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Reagan's administration, and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel, and others were murdered.
0.0	0.398947101116	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.525604698598	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.347946818581	Secondly, we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.
0.0	0.360426229556	I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.
0.0	0.30631006591	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.375540250608	Well, I got it for two reasons.
0.0	0.337925676113	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.448133287212	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.343634406256	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.429648871747	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.327684261071	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.313226145906	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.369524347106	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.425702540407	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.35457070929	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.354592642791	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.403914769901	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.481368577391	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.353083896816	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.46394867767	You have all of these disastrous airports.
0.0	0.585797985114	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.386099773361	... we will secure the border...
0.0	0.435903596238	But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America.
0.0	1.0	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.463820844545	Lehman Brothers was not a big bank.
0.0	0.480287159419	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.248347888498	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.379262394992	He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long.
0.0	0.399152984054	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.326030428964	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.294493493535	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.256964165883	We've got nothing.
0.0	0.376314786189	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.
0.0	0.397665895533	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.457243287156	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.304752035443	I think after 11 hours, that's pretty clear, yes.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.506864648135	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
0.0	0.352776927098	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.
1.0	0.362041089106	I think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street...
0.0	0.429085556893	But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it.
0.0	0.504033304219	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.470776613921	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.362990150785	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.414640925791	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.671111046458	So the total is $8,737,540,00.
0.0	0.352720002976	Give people a chance.
0.0	0.332150889481	And I -- I thought, if I didn't jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this.
0.0	0.285582104382	You know, this is not easy work.
1.0	0.601353555176	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.42099382483	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.30385870972	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.531646950957	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.371115268063	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.479629385911	I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.
0.0	0.445786409774	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.249300486931	But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
0.0	0.0	It is.
0.0	0.44087970366	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.321295030721	Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope.
0.0	0.439512072021	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.218887865807	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.363488808083	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.477934755174	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.50378298286	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.376694894155	Sit down with people like John Mccain.
0.0	0.462698450449	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.236169125535	I got that.

1.0	0.487974717698	They built a hotel.
0.0	0.218458180808	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.381458838959	You can't do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they're as threatened as we are.
0.0	0.463759554531	... (inaudible) opening statement.
0.0	0.315303716282	And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016.
0.0	0.419494541511	I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.
0.0	0.363766002844	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.348228453625	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.467775188791	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.415253069668	What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria, when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family you'd better get out now.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
1.0	0.66164419656	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.421240822206	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.471103315476	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.230981793714	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.449783486493	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.428210409094	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
0.0	0.318953172957	And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.
0.0	0.335660222522	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.346610060826	We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
0.0	0.532540782916	They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.
0.0	0.329321319273	Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done.
0.0	0.494041848416	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.363083816972	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.506248672953	I also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down.
0.0	0.152518334521	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.378989747244	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.452727377658	We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...
0.0	0.456701922025	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.486323860642	He was putting his 10 and 12-year-old boys to bed the other night.
0.0	0.413751719249	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.220839225632	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.428886620046	Got to go to Haiti last year.
0.0	0.374627080583	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.286806570369	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.428602572737	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.370772422413	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.531929896646	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.343570665414	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.
1.0	0.620983474493	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.

0.0	0.446305553633	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.465830528057	Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care.

0.0	0.332730536458	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.435263172234	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.423137817185	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.348041089092	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.437598086193	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.463599819229	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
1.0	0.663852464944	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.312474020538	Obama is going to be out playing golf.
0.0	0.409702416493	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.470160754829	In addition to that...
0.0	0.498828301938	They went to the DNC quietly.
1.0	0.516681126798	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.423296723331	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.396464377627	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.557818023658	And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.
0.0	0.504605418336	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.385087761032	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.446278756727	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.428737543307	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.400269259857	There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan.
0.0	0.399728874943	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.338580680935	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.561723953518	As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.358905394845	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.
0.0	0.36283969647	But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible.
0.0	0.394562502921	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.0	This is 2016.
0.0	0.369838372164	Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire.
0.0	0.472589202548	Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.455962320402	But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.
0.0	0.44538128096	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.402493528742	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.250632428759	I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.
0.0	0.322708660812	I didn't.
0.0	0.415979582584	So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.
1.0	0.470754687349	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.330407131694	The answer is no.
0.0	0.407373260187	The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.
0.0	0.339208932123	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.446715651868	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.42005196594	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.417603858876	And I will go back and say again, AIG was not a big bank.
0.0	0.357334300583	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.386833580814	Who do you know will defend life, marriage and religious liberty?
0.0	0.37172921484	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.406640585444	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.451463908694	We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
0.0	0.454287936181	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.425030649212	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.397475317974	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.321118485767	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.543743583881	But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.
0.0	0.24767641668	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.414816501137	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
1.0	0.384335046167	He's not wall street.
0.0	0.444306431865	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.363655891774	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.345147347006	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	1.0	I never said that.
0.0	0.300611505103	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.378951973748	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.415950618609	Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.
0.0	0.397666319312	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.346364391041	That never works.
0.0	0.342155633556	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.
0.0	0.403522356292	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.358591235536	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.446223240996	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.474797242467	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.460352419998	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.356408082566	I am advocating...
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.369502455044	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.286108547351	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.456582392062	I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.
0.0	0.515501972496	Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.
0.0	0.208178699968	We know about the Belgians.
0.0	0.412404421899	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.296567290364	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.439798182064	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.
0.0	0.470741472052	But unlike either of these two fine people, I've actually balanced a budget every single year.
0.0	0.239186597095	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.354496201408	So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there.

0.0	0.404839037608	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
0.0	0.288874393225	Thank you Chris...
0.0	0.396996717062	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.
0.0	0.210030198264	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.397410803766	Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin.
0.0	0.388008274696	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.
0.0	0.330742845425	Get rid of the fraud.
0.0	0.274187092249	No, I don't think so.
0.0	0.416661945948	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
0.0	0.371185873116	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.416322066477	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.21953292672	I totally get that.
0.0	0.386441947566	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.455962577	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.392657503387	But he wasn't a cheerleader.
0.0	0.447977927327	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
0.0	0.404526761017	And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
0.0	0.475057481279	When you ran in 2000, you said that we needed federal robust regulations.
1.0	0.52958622752	But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.
0.0	0.454716706758	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.345369462575	...John...
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.366983254982	And most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that.
0.0	0.43674856703	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.
0.0	0.410080916252	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.414992167668	We can in fact create jobs and provide job security.
0.0	0.476489811018	We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.
0.0	0.395337224961	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.436095927072	China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.464435691554	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.379606137343	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
0.0	0.522076191173	He hit oil.
0.0	0.330407131694	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.41191446776	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.397237833802	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.338454240117	But actually I am.
0.0	0.455461688256	That's fine.
0.0	0.336099338523	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.440520713153	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.412963886825	They don't want to raise the minimum wage, they don't want to do anything to increase incomes.
0.0	0.455402183284	In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America.
0.0	0.370468358416	We were attacked from Afghanistan.
0.0	0.285237962522	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.
0.0	0.295232029732	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.507833002591	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.386830928096	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.361316226546	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.0	But what...
0.0	0.345395396691	... and say there is something more important than money.
0.0	0.451808377869	And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.
0.0	0.422949771578	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.358527868808	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.411350286581	And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
0.0	0.396419591083	That is the clear and present danger.
0.0	0.187527672488	Please go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.337545404522	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.363507011759	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
1.0	0.496909126093	It's never below zero.
0.0	0.345987584409	Maria...

0.0	0.481401666592	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.385013196388	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.396594623773	What is the best way to do it?
0.0	0.358495507064	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.
0.0	0.454467833049	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.457936461009	The simple fact is, we all have a record.
0.0	0.412770958219	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.447309651264	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.630366784256	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.405668364868	Martha, may I -- Martha, may I...
0.0	0.179742842754	Alright.
0.0	0.347368353438	And who's compromised and who is principled.
0.0	0.480164949624	I...
0.0	0.328496779003	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.42492373459	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.35604190865	We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.
0.0	0.550425985034	And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to.
0.0	0.498260572873	I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal.
0.0	0.397018361338	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.259966859854	He didn't know.
0.0	0.36401148309	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.440849415943	ISIS, now, is the major priority.
0.0	0.55413586645	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.269681897264	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.377251585294	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.329536745007	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.513506584203	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.573030091768	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.396004461589	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.311771473878	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.405338541488	A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this.
0.0	0.173379113835	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.325877654295	I'm using my own money.
0.0	0.458442406587	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.361927601062	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.512251827607	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.41176527977	They would never be hired again.
0.0	0.371886568368	I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history.
0.0	0.338863703656	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.336663608167	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.
0.0	0.311461830255	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.36657202583	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.429539165702	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.403858394582	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.
0.0	0.383787191839	And Abdullah said something recently, very important.
0.0	0.471658801776	The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.
0.0	0.344622326781	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.250929619732	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.438464720506	None of that information was looked at.
1.0	0.699674098885	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.467528346332	I believe that our Federal Government needs to do more on pell grants.
0.0	0.474424483509	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.200209177069	They're not so stupid.
0.0	0.335696877586	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.448220641563	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.338886869608	CRUZL But I will say --

0.0	0.381332342651	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.433196466965	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.
0.0	0.481631388072	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.279636805218	You know, I like Marco.
0.0	0.284203696082	Can I -- can I -- I just...
0.0	0.541403757262	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.39168874032	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.569027367535	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.313039923193	She wants to pursue the American dream.
0.0	0.326127740834	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.292545597761	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.463205507625	Major crisis and primary health care.
0.0	0.495758577247	So protect the Second Amendment.
1.0	0.683291230015	I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians.
0.0	0.481735894423	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.278302264099	Well, sure.
0.0	0.436606119782	A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.
0.0	0.2257185217	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.320838476874	You can change your mind.
0.0	0.419238680924	So what I had to do then is go back and start working on a bill that wasn't the bill that I wanted.
0.0	0.361540575965	We've got to build a coalition abroad.
0.0	0.227237189697	We need that thinking.
0.0	0.499109699403	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.404005260721	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.412747406357	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.374947059556	But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble.
0.0	0.360683698064	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.369085436531	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.285230508108	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.40496863079	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
1.0	0.516324608526	But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works.
0.0	0.39386678175	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.378399193881	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
0.0	0.396088382834	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
1.0	0.515915692374	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.461481972463	It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.
0.0	0.480671998258	I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.
0.0	0.329096218288	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.25641302584	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.200067792785	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.428878858578	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.378639875002	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.233969653251	We're running.
0.0	0.512831090063	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.354334220625	And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.321412278211	Neil?
0.0	0.393608270618	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.471819834516	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.
0.0	0.446463658626	We are doing both at the same time.
0.0	0.37890506671	We have people that don't have it.
0.0	0.312357261408	We need sound money.
0.0	0.418972082719	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.

0.0	0.3528856856	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.233444441135	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
1.0	0.530932922507	It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.
0.0	0.390084444915	And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work.
0.0	0.261050589903	It never happens.
0.0	0.3710707176	I'm not using the lobbyists.
0.0	0.389500292757	We now have that.
0.0	0.464216600058	May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care?
0.0	0.444836648411	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.5132893125	It had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.0	What are we doing?
0.0	0.351717785634	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
0.0	0.385830878153	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.413095492063	But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn't cut and run.
0.0	0.413489236479	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.437997094031	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.321678101033	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.312357261408	We need sound money.
0.0	0.372676714045	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.351670101336	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.345072857204	That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.
0.0	0.379820837844	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.
0.0	0.312422000207	Please go to hillaryclinton.com and be part of making this country what we know it can and should be.
0.0	0.562484001744	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.37149470983	You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.
0.0	0.235351757797	I want a job."
0.0	0.321747823505	I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail.
0.0	0.270788607217	Creativity.
0.0	0.411062024291	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.261500921288	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.377376062804	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.491682659395	And it has three parts.
0.0	0.30366519888	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.404841714017	For her convenience.
0.0	0.406593473187	They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.
0.0	0.328532865864	I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom.
0.0	0.505577140944	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.48778448534	And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.
0.0	0.520019981535	That's what I said to my own public health people.
0.0	0.38757339648	I agree with my colleagues.
1.0	0.593674002658	That billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers.
1.0	0.403945493856	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.30766200054	And, we said no.
0.0	0.551159317991	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
0.0	0.321663651531	Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.424287036258	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.382557683696	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.423169760411	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.471740853194	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.
0.0	0.208575650297	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.454473836131	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.313167240124	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.402791954045	And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.
0.0	0.576519721454	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.441686073297	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.425582962994	Again, with all do respect to Secretary Clinton...
0.0	0.343109672076	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
0.0	0.402848810536	Everybody thought the deal was dead.
0.0	0.286468483952	That's right.
0.0	0.469371307374	People came back from Iraq and Afghanistan without legs, without arms.
1.0	0.448128498672	And some of them are like third world countries.
0.0	0.511776455184	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.364002001468	My wife, Jane, has been -- way back when before I knew her, a foster parent.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.328879570697	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.45543077971	We are already de-conflicting air space.
0.0	0.423589044332	We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States.
1.0	0.456003211585	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.412078236027	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.395548098475	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.287487355228	That is not what America should be about.
1.0	0.513563717064	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.291653277092	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.398122405653	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.397943156551	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.428045753191	Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country -- we would never build in an ocean.
0.0	0.320268788446	They will never make America great again.
0.0	0.385179362688	We need to do it now as a nation.
0.0	0.362950275928	We saw that in Egypt.
0.0	0.376268071891	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.32207151324	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.396314783378	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.410705762795	If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.
0.0	0.523373358334	My name was invoked.
0.0	0.394078004593	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.444539465123	And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.
0.0	0.268356013015	And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a -- that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.
0.0	0.424650623554	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.389764717093	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.
0.0	0.338296529315	There are a lot of things we've got to do in our country, reigning in Wall Street is certainly one of them.
0.0	0.243600850523	Here's what I believe.
1.0	0.524170213179	The Republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times.
0.0	0.294142251885	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.600376167168	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.390672443481	One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy.
0.0	0.442842164783	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
0.0	0.376318454227	I didn't know I had so much power.
0.0	0.385730924991	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
0.0	0.464438274031	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.576144122143	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.365623958554	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.286168806134	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.49753612552	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.427746235397	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.341617015203	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.335263820877	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.429039155474	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.497719405455	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.353470940708	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.422895616662	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.35450809275	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.440195425707	I have a comprehensive, tough plan.
0.0	0.261338225716	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.438105202791	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.377293280107	Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.
0.0	0.490248235487	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.565115749376	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.48467646914	At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.
0.0	0.337042517296	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.457402000178	So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.
0.0	0.352129877194	Well, thank you.
0.0	0.530086618577	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.431248466042	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.326196479427	Just can't happen.
0.0	0.495546495973	Two points.
0.0	0.330226730323	... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.
0.0	0.337766745065	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.362149804274	I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.
0.0	0.492385663404	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.260099771437	You can do both.
0.0	0.413650203032	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.390406303569	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.394351415377	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.
1.0	0.612377723347	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.274187092249	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.43745286321	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.392764347887	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.456189634735	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.256623616439	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.439462770609	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
1.0	0.632272605363	I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance.
0.0	0.316702398602	We need new leadership.
0.0	0.394152281908	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.457014769357	Support community banks and credit unions.
0.0	0.31123458151	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.458984191861	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.291677358607	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.452688810267	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.307386811206	No, I think they won't.
0.0	0.412034667744	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.530493631855	The administration originally said 10.

0.0	0.432840718105	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.

0.0	0.466465888423	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.456839025063	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.

0.0	0.249044651876	You're right about that.

0.0	0.437255766335	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.470985370284	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.57404510679	And that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums.
0.0	0.314694869862	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.404214636195	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.43046800847	Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris.
0.0	0.42053460693	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.354822754922	... First of all -- Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.579851547292	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.452583130114	I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.

0.0	0.414935995021	If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.
0.0	0.49698950592	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.413806906894	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.400608925897	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.292108940234	Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.
0.0	0.385105292763	Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.402753816125	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.396191699135	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.500661728251	I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.
0.0	0.391016824672	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.337042396972	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.196249237994	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
0.0	0.235089913374	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.410126116181	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.32864801276	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.281506632925	The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.
0.0	0.382789163377	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.302882281361	And it's an honor to have everybody here.
0.0	0.358139865437	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.469205005258	You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.
0.0	0.387299998384	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.46540998173	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
0.0	0.414982121997	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.423125902664	And, of course, I met the mothers of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, and Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and so many of them who have lost their children.
0.0	0.272587313142	I know how hard it is to build coalitions.
0.0	0.337741562042	All of these are very difficult issues.
0.0	0.326928089264	I'm not using donors.
0.0	0.408233302382	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.477742781925	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.472234126305	As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.
0.0	0.452202935692	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.54573677703	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.50458289846	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.186771757997	It's nice.
0.0	0.41647058011	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.393993408721	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.413088726959	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.535219713019	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.346974251158	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.50552582595	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.402827668903	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
0.0	0.430063399286	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.286468483952	Right.
1.0	0.685075826065	A $5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.39819391711	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.275579480627	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.462803966914	We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up.
0.0	0.50605434019	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.380845946819	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.478854298686	I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.
0.0	0.286468483952	She was right.
0.0	0.23486284943	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.525780879881	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.408251603943	And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.
0.0	1.0	That's not true.
0.0	0.377873814764	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.391231672238	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.388167894649	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.420631844669	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.369518786967	That's a hard road to walk.
0.0	0.452091699286	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.463156544251	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.506160477122	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
1.0	0.557421932278	He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.
0.0	0.470153043824	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.484288870621	We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital.
0.0	0.393863461863	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.
0.0	0.430420176878	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
1.0	0.363090160915	They stole it.
0.0	0.456614067824	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.488059665792	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.415771159706	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.446862848995	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
1.0	0.368544288536	They're bringing drugs.
0.0	0.411257336665	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
0.0	0.0	And...
0.0	0.369293146391	I said, "What's your problem?"
0.0	0.499228661965	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.188174425619	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.268783353304	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.413324471999	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.403551867663	I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.
0.0	0.408694523984	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.41274561622	And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.
0.0	0.453650293695	And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.439534496392	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.248246582432	I have to tell you.
0.0	0.314414685231	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.422741124091	And let me, by the way, take this moment to congratulate Hillary Clinton, who I thought not only did an outstanding job as our first lady, but redefined what that role could be.
0.0	0.23329402727	You're simply not.
0.0	0.4352156722	They're building up their military to a point that is very scary.
0.0	0.355244724907	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.354294978932	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.362959915057	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.394395398996	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.280505553375	Good at email.
0.0	0.378661105139	She said the truth.
0.0	0.463573371056	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.337308015812	Well, I just want to quickly add...
0.0	0.38559532471	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.499415824607	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.295675997389	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.37101908582	But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding.
0.0	0.412215391856	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.413264846576	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.598880459768	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.393781884054	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.481391172274	The world has changed.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.547795346905	Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
0.0	0.597021685286	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.440111207383	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.414670963218	The NSA is another big issue.
0.0	0.302784447444	Our vets may see the V.A.
0.0	0.479982529926	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.436664380638	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.431647634559	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.388445283109	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.48620757295	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.379252390592	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.414098379664	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.40680660135	He thinks low wages are a good idea.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.389382897959	I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
0.0	0.515870365345	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.318147648468	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.322366112191	They have no choice.
0.0	0.209195902611	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.211972809744	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.327692447625	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.441409206019	We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy.
0.0	0.378722546545	And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.
0.0	0.351191509471	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
0.0	0.487862582032	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.334594506649	And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.
0.0	0.478344839312	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.347460612205	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.364864501541	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.308237024013	I won't be doing that.
0.0	0.389472413013	I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.
0.0	0.337624204691	And for good cause.
0.0	0.338490523522	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.304952854498	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.487609790664	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.30977024021	Nothing's gonna get done.
0.0	0.394490685032	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.420395219354	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.417381310179	But Secretary Clinton is wrong.
0.0	0.340641088878	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.452734661031	And I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well.
0.0	0.451178981731	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
0.0	0.185083630655	Yeah.
0.0	0.3603521261	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.366567821721	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.404647206405	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.411094053807	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.377784770925	Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid.
0.0	0.549276475105	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.347165289488	We saw what happened in Egypt.
0.0	0.371254307973	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.346639576157	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.
0.0	0.465775577309	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.385890941622	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.295403562587	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.414381300542	And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion, this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us, and that we stand with them as they have stood with us.
0.0	0.305270059085	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.445807450026	Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.
0.0	0.309079797489	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.48175526825	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.37928962247	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.337643115045	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.315954695196	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.379358329124	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.427508944097	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.
0.0	0.376364856802	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.406666504333	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
0.0	0.269985661249	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.388730713506	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.455114730336	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
1.0	0.463938352591	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.457466125357	Marco opposed this because they made a deal.
0.0	0.372011043922	Check it out.
0.0	0.549155839816	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.409975731737	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.253173029992	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.345534287203	Let me give you the bad news.
0.0	0.31353616351	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.439428282149	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.503316334109	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.188716547961	OK...
0.0	0.238744595453	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.30300289683	We need much more than that.
0.0	0.393603669544	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.396162333498	I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.
0.0	0.453131710143	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.
0.0	0.467157093776	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.386450600262	This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.
0.0	0.471368579297	He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter.
0.0	0.431494298329	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.561014296694	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.3103622065	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.430748577836	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.487383502345	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.454290224975	But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.
0.0	0.312803450207	I don't need the rhetoric.
0.0	0.466749452619	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.242536864309	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.396426649932	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.39568077735	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.412141731822	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.
0.0	0.42220378206	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.37237550427	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.329423455618	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.246016275533	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.369712223872	We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States.
0.0	0.310732169692	We got nothing but problems.
0.0	0.48346265499	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.439868145968	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.447055948775	That means medical.
0.0	0.379694293677	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.269308030018	I like them.
0.0	0.397513929455	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.332215143642	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.286468483952	All right.
0.0	0.512621924121	The first vote hasn't been counted.
0.0	0.292590518146	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.250113162232	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.388874695939	And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country.
0.0	0.168648285041	Think of it.
0.0	0.435020026687	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.379428008017	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
1.0	0.436749436189	Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.
0.0	0.308531627291	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.38475719019	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.296008178907	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.480061377521	This entire question was an attack, but that's (inaudible)
0.0	0.345322662803	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.343437324236	Martha, we offered a lot more than they were willing to take.
0.0	0.396911077285	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.362034205594	I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third.
0.0	0.412581270436	David, I am the very first...
0.0	0.292931336687	We're dying.
0.0	0.548002646581	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.369450176652	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.287837773955	I love China.
0.0	0.312726332659	You don't hear it from anybody else.
0.0	0.0	Excuse me.
0.0	0.425510199193	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.46209149738	Al Qaida was based in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.573074656202	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.565532211624	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.45665870238	Many are in this building.
0.0	0.42930365319	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.470571035616	My daughters went to college on a mountain of bills.
0.0	0.429816445382	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.53681715918	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.592815647628	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.463474265899	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.356810562912	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.33371470443	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.327279665031	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.516258915596	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.464594206338	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.488459844375	You should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition.
0.0	0.367522956566	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.480927325241	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.419512381622	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.384559840666	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.408166216104	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.355163632244	slot.
0.0	0.415502864624	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
0.0	0.396128474254	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.448395755487	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.

0.0	0.37050080824	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
1.0	0.589703648851	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.31246875318	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.47266356874	He has never defended...
0.0	0.370095497092	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.43117054263	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.47654695675	It wasn't the bill that I wanted, but yet it turned out to be one of the more significant pieces of veterans' legislation passed in recent history.
0.0	0.428708038126	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.420100220404	I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.384788443862	Afghanistan is a mess.
0.0	0.436310975011	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
1.0	0.730117849788	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
0.0	0.276711051894	And I mean, are you kidding me?
1.0	0.59192205414	Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.
0.0	0.380145776855	I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.
0.0	0.35350082942	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.354931404555	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.545814323366	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.237262949655	And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.
0.0	0.448022532643	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.446143168942	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
0.0	0.360593801003	And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.
0.0	0.389012568792	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.31110076449	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.296293637991	We listen to you and -- and then we act.
0.0	0.40679716379	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.404588430108	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.468805740269	We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is.
0.0	0.366960225673	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.506266966007	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.372312427791	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.428493489114	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.221288556383	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.278235723373	That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.
0.0	0.346231746879	I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.
0.0	0.487879727577	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.479292471169	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.465730043354	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.270607189773	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.508202952541	They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
0.0	0.521014637924	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.480855454985	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.341351857924	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.0	I promise.
0.0	0.238910453219	I believe we've got to go further.
0.0	0.268793006688	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.44674612233	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.376875817061	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.399154472848	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.381032523595	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.410921969631	Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president.
0.0	0.413999484769	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.53746711166	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.401548419913	But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.
0.0	0.437204044087	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.449436904988	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.288449278981	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.406123170938	With all -- with all due respect...
0.0	0.296229756392	Go ahead.
0.0	0.430129527693	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.413578964536	That's the difference, and that's the kind of leader we need in the White House.
0.0	0.334047354444	Well, they're glitches because...
0.0	0.398524842772	What part is valid?
0.0	0.379872820223	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
1.0	0.555346860113	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.385611116887	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.464285032736	Illegal.
0.0	0.436201604074	Planned Parenthood will be defunded.
0.0	0.416838240584	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.38676523936	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.454287936181	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.617624231283	If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.
0.0	0.382726262987	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.271511905326	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.211810853011	They're off to China.
0.0	0.414600608725	We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations.
0.0	0.0	But...
0.0	0.380255335957	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.267514116388	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.462033268579	We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up.
0.0	0.373993323302	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.404662636596	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
1.0	0.600270912553	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.428389357221	And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people.
0.0	0.277877089077	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.352721557043	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.479561301272	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
0.0	0.36887345534	But this is what we also have to say.
0.0	0.353231145434	Really big league.
0.0	0.524930194994	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.320431748332	Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.
0.0	0.446723850989	Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground.
0.0	0.404534350705	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.335538486299	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.303934630752	You learn that threats always change.
0.0	0.352635775542	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.379977987991	So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again.
0.0	0.387961617901	I am the son and grandson of immigrants.
0.0	0.447373600147	Saudi Arabia without us is gone.
0.0	0.326637670199	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.421575287233	As president, I will support law enforcement and we'll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community.
0.0	0.36712056413	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.22846520238	I've always listened to you, Megyn.
0.0	0.466908969109	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.348860515742	We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.
0.0	0.361546309121	There are a lot of factors involved in that.
0.0	0.337450663326	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.371361377307	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
0.0	0.418946628465	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
0.0	0.42119164742	I do respect Rand.
0.0	0.642225545121	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
1.0	0.650877319635	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.463589592444	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.327486527295	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
0.0	0.405586947425	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.393878872467	But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.
0.0	0.379630268781	Here's the story.
0.0	0.283481838301	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.218888533801	I'm proud of my family.
0.0	0.547261243839	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.415965121471	... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before.
0.0	0.426968841231	I believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation.
0.0	0.323838830662	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.0	Again...
0.0	0.380098797732	Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens.
0.0	0.360976507392	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.367988885434	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.388149337744	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.52857110141	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.438955111843	I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.
0.0	0.219601909336	Go on to martinomalley.com.
0.0	0.376592098316	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.312247228088	...Chris...
0.0	0.460812737063	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.36250610035	He was a little teddy bear to me.
1.0	0.583694649269	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.367313540912	But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you.
0.0	0.44751123721	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.450178464246	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.384895331066	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.368775318875	Now the Libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge ISIS from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.
0.0	0.537630881024	It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military.
0.0	0.48873432827	Their business model is greed and fraud.
0.0	0.452004319042	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.301953670068	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.362696499536	So, I thank you very much for that.
0.0	0.487897263857	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.18674984395	Great.
0.0	0.521615084611	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.53192572931	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.467411117891	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.418776015189	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.377507527983	May I have a chance to respond to this issue?
0.0	0.37994275276	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.404363050621	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.293880032534	Does anyone know this?"
0.0	0.178955870229	Okay.
0.0	0.355575431992	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.
0.0	0.386760326168	Well, let's take it one at a time.
0.0	0.40542679691	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.44981983294	... and we will end the illegal immigration.
0.0	0.570433424648	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.555095616567	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
1.0	0.693759485319	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.

0.0	0.177351228879	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.353810673363	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.422856226687	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.0	What do we do?
0.0	0.363404093179	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.

0.0	0.488056358809	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.570669796319	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
1.0	0.491349855478	The truth of the matter is, net immigration from Mexico last year was zero.
0.0	0.345810968976	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.219601909336	...before I go.
0.0	0.457453230347	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.531257107531	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.414302577524	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.
0.0	0.456514252102	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.470578006411	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.444198747526	I think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12 it would be the highest historical average we've ever had.
0.0	0.322615894874	No interest," because I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.401361541228	The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
0.0	0.421230417191	We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
0.0	0.462807588808	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.303325602116	We will do very, very well, very, very well.
0.0	0.300111256358	Fine, I'll take it.

0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.370483177248	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.446167866089	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.394555884265	We have made some good progress.

0.0	0.470562208962	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.403550447191	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
0.0	0.284608020676	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.0	That is...
0.0	0.496053199969	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.309094853171	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.329932437945	And I apologize to nobody for that.
0.0	0.338032822787	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.385194572999	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.
0.0	0.35216014803	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.291653277092	Don't believe it.
0.0	0.286448437474	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.387362574925	The formula is working.
0.0	0.710351919704	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.294402402559	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.505686138447	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.330190722396	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.41197748789	I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up.
1.0	0.60994063848	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.326426509174	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.30766200054	I said no.
0.0	0.487270832335	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.232772279843	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.31773514262	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.339551512953	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.438965916315	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.345301853824	I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses.
0.0	0.400977462577	I believe that the goal should be debt-free college.
0.0	0.514117087403	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.422131574613	I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran.
0.0	0.431060756478	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.411475351659	They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe.
0.0	0.251245068586	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
0.0	0.607975584546	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.44799584049	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.531273357569	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.397278055143	First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.
0.0	0.400427101499	I don't get any money from Wall Street.
0.0	0.437041611078	And for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.
0.0	0.394256302768	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.498933914531	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.471487580139	And what is that proposal?
1.0	0.740945826156	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.313532761087	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.374781149537	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.447282703486	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.498679639313	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.270362254283	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.446311550468	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
0.0	0.362529599004	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.0	How?
0.0	0.404185156799	Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
0.0	0.489754677121	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.583718952118	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.433341414485	They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.
0.0	0.445074342629	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.330277157243	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.489127027437	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.512525390622	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.454085652053	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.380154942536	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
0.0	0.557796628019	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.585368632159	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.36091536866	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.447077851263	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.295638459555	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.299464879308	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.479444124541	A rich person does not.
1.0	0.581265800938	That's wrong.
0.0	0.385415000042	Donald Trump, for example -- I'm glad -- I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him...
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.537951005897	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.32225863933	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.277464829569	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.287456233279	So I would say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.438536820492	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.291740798732	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.439204778485	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.301753776369	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.459739325957	And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals -- the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
1.0	0.548783799941	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.379787156842	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.
0.0	0.402485932097	And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.337485799371	Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.
0.0	0.380428614435	We lose on trade.
1.0	0.796634263102	Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.
0.0	0.321412593401	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.533398580464	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.422581692775	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.29573209736	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.404344487053	Number two, we had a really good plan.
0.0	0.297875494531	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.427344174527	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.328381443752	I've laid out...
1.0	0.436124217269	Well, John, look, I think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis to leave by 2011, is that an Iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend Iraq.
0.0	0.393392902371	You can -- you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.
0.0	0.330386074701	Yes, they control them.
0.0	0.453045962174	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.313326091815	No, I've never made a promise like that.
0.0	0.386160321513	That's American citizenship.
0.0	0.361018907165	I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis.
0.0	0.355384506858	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.316592424064	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.35414613132	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.419876318336	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.431872223842	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.511953436111	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.356988768504	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.366225247469	But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector.
0.0	0.328261860703	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.421348745573	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.432250652427	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.489173156672	And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
0.0	0.414565396691	And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process.
0.0	0.42097831801	That's the wrong number.
0.0	0.399200705675	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
1.0	0.695536946955	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.320101180299	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.482897104469	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
1.0	0.371220535978	They're bringing crime.
0.0	0.338350718828	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.445202087366	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.454089810347	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.452178699234	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.513750683079	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.274708482915	Believe me, folks.
0.0	0.299222632757	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.353751085971	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.361886576029	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.344557720755	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.350150175612	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.464837186467	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.351107674948	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.404917965351	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.309226332367	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.322576683908	Thank you, John.
0.0	0.249847298903	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.345370901426	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.369760033352	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.361909114198	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.404576360166	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.447883859332	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.404514129659	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.345369462575	John.
0.0	0.47199213182	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.397151908802	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
1.0	0.756918833764	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.42405284324	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.345062669659	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.480963808764	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.260099771437	You can have him.
0.0	0.42283366959	On January 20th, 2017, the next president of the United States will walk into the White House.
0.0	0.363759689344	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.51575156091	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.431694863395	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.506378618051	I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.
0.0	0.34325504549	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.603894253237	We raised the minimum wage.
0.0	0.344348336219	Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.251797250934	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.422881599575	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.426281150746	They want American troops back in the Middle East.
0.0	0.448303702299	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.463665086176	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.584146445492	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.435831065511	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.26861191986	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.45420098055	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.390806147483	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.387235100844	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
1.0	0.684435201516	Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world.
0.0	0.400256342339	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
1.0	0.618339855929	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.421743260908	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.481626022503	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
1.0	0.497451379724	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.313841844482	That's my view.
0.0	0.353971524054	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.34247822747	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.295610024991	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.237810258643	I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country.
0.0	0.422245322188	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.481201359027	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.405158980892	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.428135266777	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.298443790098	I need your help.
0.0	0.320274812987	And the answer is: Because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda.
0.0	0.214297410164	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.486344654286	We have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information.
0.0	0.395406802213	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.251402584981	But I learned a lot.
0.0	0.388213324086	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.308534048798	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.412363140932	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.406549805224	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.42182554747	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.411798092986	So, what we want to do is to say, look, we have 11 million people who have been here, many of them for decades.
0.0	0.408874191588	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.431517334592	I mean, let's talk about this arc of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about.
0.0	0.396938758519	And I hear their speeches.
0.0	0.456426285835	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.500198375752	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.382568105656	If he'd like to play, that's fine.
0.0	0.31297996004	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.332688423874	I don't care.
0.0	0.491402818274	We have three children, eight, five and one.
0.0	0.23662271876	You looking at me?
0.0	0.497786693093	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.508401135071	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.44075306902	The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.
0.0	0.357703751094	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.410250635182	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.372563833939	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.370283315616	I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.430887801182	Rebuild the country's infrastructure.
0.0	0.322851910794	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.292127066144	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.293849225741	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.253498911351	We don't know anything about that.
0.0	0.413364380483	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.394233839962	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.307070996268	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.0	I will not do that.
0.0	0.326623326555	We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.
0.0	0.340451322793	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.35226411332	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
1.0	0.62435617623	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?

0.0	0.331274012973	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.430129777658	Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly.
0.0	0.34261238347	They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).
0.0	0.341666255334	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.423302283936	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.495538598383	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.392472653937	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.302193661687	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.472453077662	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.388397966802	Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.339532643615	... against Islam -- radical Islam -- if you're not for border security.
0.0	0.415748087837	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.447004067148	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.335219388606	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.371450682555	But I was born here.
0.0	0.385313496116	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.310544192016	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.373857808015	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.548098730676	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
0.0	0.400382779643	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.599212957919	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.318056052467	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.
0.0	0.268267516432	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
0.0	0.500513017462	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
0.0	0.352074121741	Yes, we must protect our borders.
0.0	0.0	Why is it...
0.0	0.40492944165	We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.
0.0	0.448177056459	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.0	That has not been...
0.0	0.396510938728	The facts are are very, very simple.
0.0	0.415614753478	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.399131089175	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.460670347635	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.446760157502	Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
0.0	0.363035670659	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.588861474353	... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record.
0.0	0.38779333887	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.369734059203	I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
0.0	0.396618730642	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.50561410899	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.265244640161	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.387947891316	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.444886692308	And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.
0.0	0.410550904958	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.423111122549	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
0.0	0.360383676977	But it's a lot safer.
0.0	0.327329617702	And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.
0.0	0.355443448673	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.446021102362	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.371173960823	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.367815460355	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.430704484416	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.363614814897	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.381639470592	We don't win.
0.0	0.185083630655	Yeah.
0.0	0.448423950952	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.506194838544	So there's more to my plan than just the cap.
0.0	0.330420653878	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.408129567817	And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms.
1.0	0.430239419307	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.208178699968	How do I know this?
0.0	0.236169125535	We got it.
0.0	0.333629800651	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.568660298837	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.483611268396	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
0.0	0.347994433846	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.246087235264	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
0.0	0.43873987948	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.334214579479	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.33747790622	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.346663357099	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.428528266837	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.320111414605	I think it's important we put this in historic context.
0.0	0.49340073389	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.360086675947	That's just media stuff.
0.0	0.590001813087	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.359321347107	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.378585661197	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.
0.0	0.512925030508	So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.
1.0	0.715436357655	I lost that election by three percentage points.
0.0	0.355660054538	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.344148642513	That will change everything.
0.0	0.260715242511	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.27711052499	And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.
0.0	0.439715837608	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.385849282284	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.491623971868	Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.
0.0	0.395782907934	I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.
0.0	0.312089475998	Didn't just happen.
0.0	0.321099072944	I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here...
0.0	0.367413006716	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.410845157856	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.389216921967	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.466599719053	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.412147387953	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.329775436189	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.2603683235	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.565473027822	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.343183271001	The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans.
0.0	0.362959600534	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.37761853925	I mean, that's a fact.
0.0	0.464314523618	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.41202816652	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.439679841201	These are often very long- term kinds of investments that have to be made.
0.0	0.459798764235	And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.
0.0	0.208178699968	We know...
0.0	0.455103485679	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.430122381263	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.395775843418	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.436074341972	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.431025152266	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.320220148957	I am telling the truth.
0.0	0.379138533285	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.258998006497	Let me...
0.0	0.446732258765	Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.0	And before I say it, I have to say this.
0.0	0.22839262834	I don't want it."
0.0	0.334829709231	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.416648355204	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
1.0	0.687259524128	Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.
0.0	0.48240691439	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.399723134615	And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.
0.0	0.456398325048	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.388536889898	There are no simple solutions.
0.0	0.325652655	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.349644973379	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.509386306287	As president, I would make the administrator of USAID an actual cabinet member.
0.0	0.343399827151	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.449585362064	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.5488650913	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.436629603761	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.
1.0	0.706792800857	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.440415227662	And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years.
0.0	0.285005909707	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.45896854534	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.325214441978	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.359208649886	But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
0.0	0.468651316143	If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.
0.0	0.399174120999	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.282539051066	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.26930165776	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.
0.0	0.261464235068	They're going to build in Mexico.
0.0	0.352956088566	We need money.
0.0	0.514078819475	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.0	How do we do it?"
0.0	0.52412488315	You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks.
0.0	0.453559010777	You do legislation.
0.0	0.0	Why?
0.0	0.449556682098	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.361641995085	Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country.
1.0	0.567186976564	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.480328688799	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.408602263573	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.388391217354	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.235884023175	If not, they can stay where they are.
0.0	0.46866532827	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.413926878699	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.529882475778	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.188716547961	OK?
0.0	0.410778039808	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.394878903857	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.306291096127	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.
0.0	0.439444094484	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.352268873251	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.390217141336	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.393558071712	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.310708123047	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.499472529355	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.436255520528	I will put a price tag.
1.0	0.524670581957	And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
0.0	0.202705080861	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.

0.0	0.406217040028	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
0.0	0.394284904275	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...
0.0	0.405633321631	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.203627451476	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.420706290992	Well, I would just repeat that.
0.0	0.365569853614	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.366118007873	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.312929081094	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.346446355089	Now we're having smaller families.

0.0	0.38618924919	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.49463607576	We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.
0.0	0.512702336697	Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons -- three out of four people in prison are black or brown.
0.0	0.405097736729	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.387912274275	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.296428146766	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.444910714587	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.230556446877	As a Catholic, that's what I want to do.
0.0	0.595824185517	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.299491062699	People that know me, like me.
0.0	0.454150836977	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.318792829599	I want security.
0.0	0.316278028888	And a lot of people are doing that.
0.0	0.320719352276	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.560753463838	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.42043016028	We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we're not going to hand out citizenship cards, either.
0.0	0.204307770172	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.350620817655	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.396191699135	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.232772279843	I've done it.
0.0	0.392133056966	I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s.
0.0	0.393060741239	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.337989414846	Let me just -- let me just...
1.0	0.633146253639	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.456049535683	In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill, "Well I assume Hillary has told you about this."
0.0	0.41522426754	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.363679615051	It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them.
0.0	0.370929647612	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.604249215859	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.471466993512	Meanwhile, the rich get richer.
0.0	0.188716547961	OK.
0.0	0.427608401119	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
0.0	0.428855055045	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.372252349374	But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.
0.0	0.208178699968	And you know what?
0.0	0.490565505406	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.351087625917	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.418470740407	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.406184452575	They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.443024082613	And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.
0.0	0.330391177537	He's very charming.
0.0	0.42999787665	You cannot grant amnesty.
0.0	0.385521798445	It cannot be contained, it must be defeated.
0.0	0.390995771312	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.
0.0	0.365652568973	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.411718966361	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.354140004455	I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path.
0.0	0.46560111584	She has devoted her life, when I was mayor of the city of Burlington, actually when I first met her, we started a youth office, which started a after-school programs for kids, started a child care center, started a youth newspaper.
0.0	0.439795384678	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.458186613883	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.439720410001	It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
0.0	0.232580222337	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.318684086221	They've advertised that.
0.0	0.41377312921	Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.
0.0	0.330764883908	That's what the political revolution is about.
0.0	0.415563283833	When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.311873101698	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.304959039124	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.258921731497	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
0.0	0.391995302682	Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable?
1.0	0.601413794876	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
0.0	0.265277433096	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.503464483144	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.218177695165	We're friends.
0.0	0.364574208598	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.337958219143	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.402821651227	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
1.0	0.55306499803	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.347091806975	I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.
0.0	0.387525339076	But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here.
0.0	0.383005093633	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.46428853911	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.48771933115	But I have another one, Ford.
0.0	0.532697702641	Number one, there are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.498376851805	We have more people in jail today than any other country on earth.

0.0	0.526961427409	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.524149503331	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.362201585699	Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem.
0.0	0.455055935677	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.479042200796	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.487859556613	It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state.
0.0	0.410713168087	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.423914564557	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.406145274897	The list goes on because the differences are so stark.
0.0	0.283605970147	Now, this is getting to be fun.
0.0	0.479145492526	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.379945248071	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.457120850386	I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground.
0.0	0.354808597107	He was vibrant.
0.0	0.348632809397	Because it wouldn't work.

0.0	0.217425380841	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.479205107927	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.291894622442	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.413795556089	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.42910950058	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.352816188094	I said, "Is he intelligent?"

0.0	0.287993791911	No vision at all.
0.0	0.501215109419	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.

0.0	0.293270761937	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.306644416583	I've done an amazing job.
0.0	0.523131312906	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.455804275083	Not keeping the government open.

0.0	0.268172432699	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.420095212106	I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.
0.0	0.458552317383	And it requires an entire world to come together, including in a very active way, the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.420349223246	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.496993123644	This is what's made our nation so special.
0.0	0.406737988011	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.3636629924	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.455864488421	You lead and you produce results.

1.0	0.580963153448	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.

0.0	0.489626684129	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.394318619771	I -- I believe that we should make community college free.
0.0	0.557337149877	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.5229765065	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.329593660999	I was the architect.
0.0	0.385833069258	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.410912030573	And Mr. Trump is very focused...

0.0	0.313248236314	And some, I assume, are good people.
0.0	0.462777058554	I (inaudible).
0.0	0.370338327748	Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down.
0.0	0.298500898702	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.0	No, you did.
0.0	0.270809946347	They were wrong.
0.0	1.0	Of course not.
0.0	0.368806658994	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.421280579635	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
0.0	0.450070459812	But bottom line now, is in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or her family.
0.0	0.300690365688	I don't have to brag.
0.0	0.480317069602	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.

0.0	0.359848189138	People who we should be welcoming and working with.
0.0	0.453549489842	So it was not against ISIS, it was against -- it was against Assad.
0.0	0.422434099808	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.

0.0	0.513163272527	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.437740070772	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.398488969716	So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.

0.0	0.431151034381	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.

0.0	0.580149578988	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.411723421597	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.

0.0	0.362331836727	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.54737057429	I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone.

0.0	0.345631248789	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.370301961161	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
1.0	0.424531507496	We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
0.0	0.397396611583	One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this, is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations.
0.0	0.249842706172	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.48916460587	Two weeks later, the place was blown up.

0.0	0.489444397176	Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
0.0	0.336679825743	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.
0.0	0.269667657119	And it has been amazing to me.
0.0	0.393289863237	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.514344869026	Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military.
0.0	0.445792971773	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.457940495139	For over 200 years, America's light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again.

0.0	0.360136835887	You've got to go the extra mile.
0.0	0.415004815101	Our country is in crisis.
0.0	0.364285298786	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.387733931718	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.369941868281	Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values.
0.0	0.495525892399	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.610853482637	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.394175360278	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.4294243092	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.428104827265	It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.
0.0	0.284153416964	Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.
0.0	0.390587490227	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.564686746772	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.480007276875	But it was also the cascading effects that followed that.
0.0	0.269308030018	I like them.
0.0	0.686950052972	So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion.
0.0	0.29831856498	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.3210686472	I like China.
0.0	0.418712315211	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.359874299055	We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists.
0.0	0.287384099855	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.465140238502	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.386969804056	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.472738630906	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.464659521602	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.420841027065	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.344090175773	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.321116737588	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.362489643242	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.333742581098	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.30766200054	That's what I said.
0.0	0.401070330451	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.303874352986	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.
0.0	0.377342190282	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.39578902863	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.487693065967	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.559613151578	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.0	...Thank you.
0.0	0.498193913064	But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.
0.0	0.397225188652	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.392822980421	At the same time we're doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform.
0.0	0.352819973013	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.445201835627	We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.
1.0	0.539342706498	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
0.0	0.362217636447	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
0.0	0.0	But...
0.0	0.496405335508	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.410927827009	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.404656693238	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.372155553731	I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones.
0.0	0.54814278862	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.382009650078	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.48772080292	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.273037641088	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.
0.0	0.31123458151	And let me be clear.
1.0	0.755948999406	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.497900630445	A few days ago a similar incident happened.
0.0	0.424516626071	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.475292871378	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.459837454404	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.403940870934	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.364761462398	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.330210911851	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.325670265531	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
0.0	0.362096303031	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.305053897028	He's very smooth.
0.0	0.304433012316	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
1.0	0.564654171211	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.286828201087	Because we don't want them in and out -- we don't want them in and out of the prisons.
0.0	0.315912136425	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.345713394164	All of us believe climate change is real.
0.0	0.427979283658	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.389578518106	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.0	How about this?
0.0	0.360168798573	And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.
0.0	0.334503698519	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.451576019124	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.359222291552	So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
0.0	0.208249397739	You're certainly not very good.
0.0	0.361976051324	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.45362028683	We are at war with violent extremism.
0.0	0.444687016339	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
0.0	0.385591322509	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.443642094496	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.
0.0	0.405032034422	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.253922251968	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.339278255669	But I went further than that.
0.0	0.204811519956	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.464270992019	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.41361054928	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.236169125535	We got it.
0.0	0.388928659808	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.336137009259	We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America.
0.0	0.542998396284	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.41053051644	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.354016520329	But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything -- everything, they got away with it again.
0.0	0.408663946516	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.421301231327	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.358281388038	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.550248758449	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.432701843579	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.386292994041	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.332518733254	Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.
0.0	0.440248133213	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.
0.0	0.531902936011	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.306576017744	You want one?
0.0	0.522830084834	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.2785029789	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.462227177368	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.276547808972	I've gotta do it."
0.0	0.387478321759	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.320012235485	David...
0.0	0.427165091577	Folks, it's not too late.
0.0	0.195813155557	I think he'd be a great spirit."
0.0	0.355706596275	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.472995167829	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.457926075828	Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.
0.0	0.422165912825	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.185955940098	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.37767328192	It all will be scrutinized.
0.0	0.430511996846	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.525006241454	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.38630423331	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.378970029954	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...
0.0	0.523617243615	to save a company.
0.0	0.358284161973	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.366132676308	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.520757044376	First of all...
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.345759042994	I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
0.0	0.0	I have.
0.0	0.330593527186	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.388964997453	I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to -- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.
0.0	0.22072753183	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.488927237447	... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.47414005251	Why do -- why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major -- the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?
1.0	0.67515202039	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
0.0	0.362376596412	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.494652717181	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.211972809744	That's what we need.
0.0	0.257580097545	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.327480656683	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.
0.0	0.243804447311	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.291902067464	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.414622220984	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.250929619732	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.384999166577	And there is a lot we can do in college affordability.
0.0	0.412097992566	We have people that are morally corrupt.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.495656291503	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.540873815208	By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started.
0.0	0.642036759504	You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent.
0.0	0.366934148123	And I have to tell you, I would not want -- if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my health care.
0.0	0.382214506194	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.583034579661	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.484613686273	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.413266162023	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.447289699422	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.431591168159	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
1.0	0.565928508696	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.245000837394	We all understand that.
0.0	0.329426124461	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.428340046951	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.483106033949	You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super PAC and they're advertising against me in Iowa as we speak.
0.0	0.387889022379	I saw Ted Cruz say, "we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill."
0.0	0.370459471531	They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.
0.0	0.398895619876	The central question in this race is trust.
0.0	0.446644378352	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.521394383211	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.371267184972	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
1.0	0.524930194994	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
1.0	0.715927559791	So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education.
0.0	0.0	But Megyn...
0.0	0.385379654359	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.416565649043	We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game.
0.0	0.37735632017	You know why three?
0.0	0.335967016684	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.352955861916	I don't think a halt is necessary.
0.0	0.385705930132	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.348167595269	It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible.
0.0	0.360789360308	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.444396171417	They're not supporting our law enforcement officers, it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you're a law enforcement officer.
1.0	0.779544845364	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.419955743039	Man (ph), their mother's here as well.
0.0	0.430461572357	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
1.0	0.559141496034	And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
0.0	0.376542488009	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.479323663878	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.43077578194	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.421709569466	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.312524179433	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.328806630473	Yes, exactly, exactly.
0.0	0.0	So did you.
0.0	0.375915492991	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.436790482914	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
0.0	0.49371337255	You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
0.0	0.514851681169	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.513881242317	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.269826526429	That's what should be done.
0.0	0.395023563805	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.26168367345	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.459871914817	This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.
0.0	0.311830629556	I agree completely.
0.0	0.456406919151	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.

0.0	0.463263738618	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.

0.0	0.410901344323	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.364222929825	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.484204648199	And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.

0.0	0.330873738737	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.377411483148	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.471531212104	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.393483487466	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.

0.0	0.371115268063	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.433565197586	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.386927231015	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.278420150442	I think it's a two-pronged issue.
0.0	0.335765807809	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.326499555212	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.5000064607	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.

0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.488032313687	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy.
0.0	0.320398401055	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
0.0	0.421085161105	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.

0.0	0.481237043022	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.40535068694	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.417040099982	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.421038694639	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.

0.0	0.45123213412	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.

0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.291585791783	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.521803872827	In fact, if you remember, 50, 60 years ago, the University of California, City University of New York were virtually tuition-free.
0.0	0.471600727604	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.510198728909	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.448432980715	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.417928648033	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.

0.0	0.250929619732	We have a lot of work to do.

0.0	0.355126700138	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.321224382479	They've become rich.

0.0	0.480312633766	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.3381697182	And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.
0.0	0.31939606219	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.488420394317	Number one, you have people in this country that...

0.0	0.185083630655	Yeah.
0.0	0.0	That's good.
0.0	0.544065257812	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.
0.0	0.448113040709	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.422849041305	You know where their United States headquarters is located?

0.0	0.303530706603	So I've watched the politicians.
0.0	0.263421883671	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.564781491926	And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.
0.0	0.471169921614	And I applaud his record in Maryland.
0.0	0.471334663302	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.

0.0	0.548598398934	Thousands.
0.0	0.35614851772	There's been no crowd like this.

0.0	0.435730624637	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
0.0	0.488646591436	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.310087251595	Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, "Sorry, fellas.

0.0	0.387468469363	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.302343583233	If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen.
0.0	0.291413971507	See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together.
0.0	0.362224845816	So, your original question is the right question.
0.0	0.319184558603	The Secretary's obviously right.
0.0	1.0	Of course, you would.
0.0	0.32260452816	We will see what the American people are willing to support.
0.0	0.346020250751	But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said.
0.0	0.435685787695	They should be Muslim troops.
0.0	0.478890488747	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.346989637526	Well, thank you, John.
0.0	0.32638868499	Hillary doesn't want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her.
0.0	0.370923880833	Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take.
0.0	0.489000923496	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.383808785663	They don't even have a chance.
0.0	0.314083148427	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.313850946286	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.303106572661	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.185955940098	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.455041901223	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.387650658389	So -- because we got to make the country rich.
0.0	0.347480131926	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.46621077241	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.334871081619	I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.
0.0	0.33331755856	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.399507233419	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.391225502741	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.391749526209	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.372478629221	We actually took action to do these things and as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families.
1.0	0.62505207244	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.533020205646	One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines.
0.0	0.353757795113	You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.
0.0	0.439390251664	He said, "we have the military in the streets right now.
0.0	0.313264364331	We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets.
0.0	0.429183590886	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.341990648337	Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform.
0.0	0.286949192579	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.31931003194	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.465650892498	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.449136614611	And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.
0.0	0.44621150891	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.497097315858	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.359561155832	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.421142480274	This is revolutionary for education in America.
0.0	0.392187769249	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.382164003156	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.412305933272	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
0.0	0.454287936181	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.304895064614	Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.
0.0	0.427329887164	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.548420979698	We reduced violent crime to 30-year lows.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.0	2,000?
0.0	0.39970669	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.
0.0	0.414360133345	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.415242156526	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.420293538194	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.473186212538	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.446119900946	That means education.
0.0	0.301383090357	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.384868829855	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.397949634002	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.352806755343	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.441120856516	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	0.300344424528	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.50516793086	And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.
0.0	0.401026882964	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.426659129455	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.271942951016	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.412178360446	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.422390493775	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.388381058482	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.309153075698	But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.
0.0	0.493427474759	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.489897071302	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.340845743765	And, I will tell you, I love my life.
0.0	0.25314776229	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.387716188291	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.46476824361	There's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.
0.0	0.53031658309	It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested.
0.0	0.38547146088	And Teddy Roosevelt is right.
0.0	0.259723041557	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
1.0	0.591518918898	We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.353538729205	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.485025356269	And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.
0.0	0.272407241599	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.345372264964	Given the fact that she's a lot smarter than me, yes, she would.
0.0	0.212918119953	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.296204136934	Ever.
0.0	0.342690272896	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.440945678017	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.511153992427	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.398654433394	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.410671905462	And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans.
0.0	0.38775244606	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.488111043847	But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.
0.0	0.553600244239	We were the first to pass a minimum wage.
0.0	0.368279508959	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.456786549577	John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.
0.0	0.299484337731	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.524468649797	It'll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there's no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.
0.0	0.417619055573	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.413703913104	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.339208273984	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.209803583971	I feel like...
0.0	0.393175718677	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.345705925301	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.463362542573	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.432078954922	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.48951832574	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.528306429701	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.
0.0	0.520757044376	First of all...
0.0	0.224852749357	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.41294201347	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.421131629142	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.
0.0	0.286751589002	And I want to make this our government.
1.0	0.649082700272	And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.
0.0	0.735001804751	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.436806000339	Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.
0.0	0.329716307274	You are not our adversary, you are our partner.
0.0	0.457744346833	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.377836743661	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.304239557858	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.208178699968	But you know what?
0.0	0.329142451084	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.447714364594	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.52417336694	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.334051504539	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.286837096945	Well, I did.
0.0	0.345061190122	Now, you'd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me?
0.0	0.237482660762	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.572161900555	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.312407413037	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.377299159496	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.473805347824	We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq.
0.0	0.421492010778	Break them up.
0.0	0.451199212956	I was there in '89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.
0.0	0.288653583721	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.286468483952	Right?
0.0	0.297145452246	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.540664850208	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.412085824561	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.361974392198	I was in Burlington, Iowa.
0.0	0.43968310798	From top to bottom.
0.0	0.31025578938	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.431337984272	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.441161709265	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.0	I will...
0.0	0.431998041431	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
0.0	0.413869969814	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.260099771437	I can.
0.0	0.483228308918	Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place.
0.0	0.184573617218	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.446151437959	If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out.
0.0	0.380544689831	So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.
0.0	0.495499198589	We only have one or two.
0.0	0.462687606015	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.341923735704	And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them.
0.0	0.361863437158	We have people that aren't working.
0.0	0.293588738309	I know the overrated ones.
0.0	0.338803556604	I have worked for his re-election.
1.0	0.540570535732	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
0.0	0.348301115505	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.384871312307	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.427842218076	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.465687441258	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.414251454275	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.275594772214	What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.
0.0	0.40456498403	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.22839262834	I don't want it.
0.0	0.446432366703	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.
0.0	0.562153426997	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.333515475775	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.
0.0	0.329059531766	I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.
0.0	0.584419653793	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.350616786241	We need to figure this out together.
0.0	0.286328284313	I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is.
0.0	0.402416513156	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.390385721197	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.498817126073	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.424405567096	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.318887921565	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.380529881249	They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
0.0	0.284705085609	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.529962725357	Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.
0.0	0.426509217656	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.309466725305	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.475744554484	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.355670706684	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.360759626025	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
0.0	0.517285576908	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.472410446874	The business model of Wall Street is fraud.
0.0	0.324422030414	We can't.
0.0	0.395406802213	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.293787830547	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.405764583798	And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump," and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns.
1.0	0.473572056429	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.453739199323	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.207889200784	And here's what's going to happen.
0.0	0.266934939586	But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate.
0.0	0.289138223215	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.41618157525	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.19620910399	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.401350263181	Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.
0.0	0.428353239141	The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering, these are not the perpetrators.
0.0	0.31250838467	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.426693847643	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.456600124123	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.54616626849	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.524927712478	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.383779186326	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.502593378205	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.404946084126	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.355928756709	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.302885276272	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.421661234272	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.465799018346	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.549747023551	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.392006362064	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.246736644267	You just want to...
0.0	0.31314034319	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.322708660812	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.292845285428	We don't need that.
0.0	0.219985757699	Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.
0.0	0.544913190156	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.482643297004	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.347185157355	We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression.
0.0	0.439211901145	Furthermore, in a competitive global economy, it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world.
0.0	0.188203445898	Who are we kidding?
0.0	0.294906798306	So should the UK, so should France.
0.0	0.372011043922	Check it out.
0.0	0.458811385675	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
1.0	0.430954737278	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.361304718214	Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.
0.0	0.394106223979	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.
0.0	0.353719083449	But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue -- requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.48381888189	I led the effort, unfortunately unsuccessfully, against deregulation because I knew when you merge large insurance companies and investment banks and commercial banks it was not going to be good.
0.0	0.368403584926	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.330107105943	Big difference.
0.0	0.268149607875	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.274187092249	I don't think so.
0.0	0.27281981029	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.425047032534	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.344345368346	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.406741030123	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.261447961615	That's kind of a no-brainer.
1.0	0.58240828113	In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.
0.0	0.333451197119	He said, "Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."
0.0	0.470377022654	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.531387856865	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.36044986199	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.387163781617	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.419721187896	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.380140654371	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
0.0	0.506348648382	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.
0.0	0.413214563458	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.421846980161	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.420084739582	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.438246738174	It's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement.
0.0	0.431356591956	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.46826256645	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
0.0	0.420280274866	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
0.0	0.469672872994	In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men.
0.0	0.371776336634	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.453164344242	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.372815511143	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.361971185569	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.387504213271	Never support.
0.0	0.446378699015	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.31854511969	And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.
0.0	0.477951691986	That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.
0.0	0.361966943801	They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.
0.0	0.380876261735	I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not.
0.0	0.424123862974	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.471207372816	It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.
0.0	0.504260498621	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.402087994261	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.396874092595	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.438830966337	I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart.
0.0	0.420890381383	Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.
0.0	0.420769591267	You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future.
0.0	0.461944064172	The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.
0.0	0.346302302643	And we do have a role in this.
0.0	0.321137915588	I think this is a very difficult issue.
0.0	0.439564402886	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.400048417892	I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support.
0.0	0.344113689524	So they put together this.
0.0	0.352956088566	Because we need money.
0.0	0.241693600024	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.432298852641	And that's only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.
0.0	0.408043808056	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.463693380132	The intelligence was by no means absolute.
0.0	0.568802786292	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.43840245219	Everybody's for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.259945111225	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.439155659248	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.414929222124	The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world.
0.0	0.556590213061	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.376170949562	And, here's what she said to the American people.
0.0	0.499788431461	It's their money.
0.0	0.359592992994	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
0.0	0.457081758014	And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.
0.0	0.4958079981	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.290387893958	He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, "No interest."
0.0	0.314218362556	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.455978721686	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.320402800112	I would prioritize them.
0.0	0.276668796456	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.298323780302	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.506267944042	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.376678334617	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.286468483952	That is not right.
0.0	0.0	It was...
0.0	0.472294777563	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.288382199411	I have no idea.
0.0	0.350178192659	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.360199024283	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.404568634844	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.360456740541	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.446139112216	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.412298375054	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.346944272826	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.437375590559	They sweated like dogs.
0.0	0.446446790871	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.429632398552	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.345848813857	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.389122146715	in particular.
0.0	0.446487569193	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.48175526825	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.217433144949	And guess what?
0.0	0.463027123082	We will -- when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice.
0.0	0.374775324969	It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.
0.0	0.272407241599	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.243736653007	Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.
0.0	0.45260041069	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.533046683111	Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.
0.0	0.208178699968	You know why?
0.0	0.31247218021	Yes, I apologize.
0.0	0.314644505094	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.414468151481	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.303759425689	That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them.
0.0	0.431568417163	If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences.
0.0	0.339897257097	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.470983559155	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.429851903895	A lot of the rights that have been won over years, from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights, will be at risk.
0.0	0.260099771437	And we can do it.
0.0	0.387287912489	Social Security, which Republicans call a Ponzi scheme, may face privatization.
0.0	0.378057582699	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.439865460183	You count on it.
0.0	0.0	That is what we have to do.
0.0	0.295821709187	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.296772295856	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.434052564871	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.34897151448	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.226016142873	It can happen.
0.0	0.434236093356	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
1.0	0.536601754387	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.609972861367	We defended the highest median income in the country.
0.0	0.429888017792	Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.
0.0	0.403105873269	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.373532889952	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
1.0	0.628087798776	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.381024576793	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.430744124824	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.343647961945	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.478810367942	She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.40822728585	It's a country in which people choose to buy guns.
0.0	0.511053725872	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.429362947425	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.403836122362	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.
1.0	0.459843010942	We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks a piece.
0.0	0.309625106171	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	1.0	No, it's true.
0.0	0.366992146837	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.48180050838	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.403481192534	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.479347523481	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
1.0	0.670607843247	One candidate said, you know what, I don't think it's a great idea that we sell automatic weapons in this country that are used by the military to kill people very rapidly.
0.0	0.327322568711	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.383911786264	I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.
0.0	0.475436003663	That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
0.0	0.515596566222	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
0.0	0.292815482641	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.338086585715	They don't like that.
0.0	0.208178699968	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.409465048266	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.
0.0	0.39823314741	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.516649322738	I -- you know, know that Senator Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers.
0.0	0.338385920591	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.480593969263	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.468273629337	We got it done in my state by leading with principal and that's what we need to do as a party for comprehensive gun safety.
0.0	0.345242872676	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.338489479771	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.497171126581	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.370768908734	Because you realize that people depending on you.
0.0	0.501267361514	We now have a gun on every table.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.335853644671	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.374993052235	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.388639200455	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.406908940123	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.511574420865	In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.
0.0	0.522451651544	I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons.
0.0	0.398635381928	But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.
0.0	0.405290104429	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.422605082599	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.520125877354	So that it will not be a federal crime.
0.0	0.378768628098	I think the issue here is -- and I applaud Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.543898298951	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.317680337322	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.371103516148	But here's the real key.
1.0	0.195075609752	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.562951547184	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.446599553295	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
1.0	0.537563830494	Nancy, the blueprint in Maryland that we followed was yes, we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment.
0.0	0.339007120493	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.490173207053	I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.428789422986	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.488596982165	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.369808255997	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.34573864918	They are ripping us.
1.0	0.539232927221	It was below zero.
0.0	0.353339808357	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.424834601224	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.497088365815	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.351745555603	All of us want equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.386687429209	They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.
0.0	0.271583992721	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.285593512202	Well, I've got news for you, we can.
0.0	0.490903937075	Yes, well, roughly.
0.0	0.260099771437	We can do that.
0.0	0.363983732793	But Obamacare kicks in in 2016.
0.0	0.481065015708	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.25225951817	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.345152632556	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.
0.0	0.319549978585	I've faced it.
0.0	0.496806483851	... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.41600497007	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.244347741583	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.482137013694	It has too much economic power.
0.0	0.37341830191	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.441269777564	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.188716547961	OK.
0.0	0.302859107752	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.252803256398	We say "we're gonna protect."
0.0	0.421078589313	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.361438967953	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.471899749195	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.448659285952	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.415791830915	I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider.
1.0	0.374503216647	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.348099671997	But wait, I just want to say this Senator.
0.0	0.651339650828	And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion."
0.0	0.526880076532	My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.
0.0	0.487981683668	I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.
0.0	0.463667634807	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.301747656728	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.585572473003	Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978.
0.0	0.356330448969	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.401343809147	All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee.
1.0	0.643014724966	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.291131628468	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.393668936921	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.355015108298	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.201029183932	We get Bergdahl.
0.0	0.678033877121	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.405968958621	You learn to create a security cabinet.
0.0	0.173225807967	But look...
0.0	0.322248396982	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.336352361392	He'll say, "Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico."
0.0	0.603493242062	To get deregulated -- listen to this, they spent $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions over a 10-year period.
0.0	0.347136181577	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.472776339741	And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.
0.0	0.292523378589	I don't think we're at war with all Muslims.
0.0	0.320274002046	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
1.0	0.617020533462	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.39670990761	But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be looking for new sources of energy.
0.0	0.362696499536	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.395285740159	As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.378957046084	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.365282745677	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.277301599908	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.447462744429	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.422199025309	The endorsements that I'm proud of are conservative leaders like Dr. James Dobson, and over 700,000 contributions nationwide, people going to our Web site, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.281998903268	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	1.0	I never said that.
0.0	0.224837604382	And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are.
0.0	0.513116719063	We were the first in the family.
0.0	0.269308030018	I like it.
0.0	0.405462548718	Hey, I have lobbyists.
0.0	0.596612504981	Not assets."
0.0	0.629189661605	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.237435432542	That's what really matters.
0.0	0.413955325388	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.300471113853	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.413421588425	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.49594708005	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.48110168871	It's virtually useless.
0.0	0.51016559712	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.507261072314	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.296372072433	... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
0.0	0.347049128119	That's the job.
0.0	0.38518335584	I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena.
1.0	0.485884932943	I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer.
0.0	0.489368733209	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.43317253551	Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization called ISIS.
0.0	0.328393029506	And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen.
0.0	0.330374536194	He couldn't answer the question.
0.0	0.338107689281	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.34598676937	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.363084582815	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.
0.0	0.483580688673	And if our middle class makes more money, they spend more money, and our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.436220103738	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.298517290033	You know, I've always had a great deal of respect.
0.0	0.378712999602	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.299535664527	I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...
0.0	0.335994215523	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.35366945011	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.461844389312	If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.
0.0	0.237134909764	And we're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.338992290883	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.398765782216	Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone.
0.0	0.458195297395	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.306889859887	I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs.
0.0	0.429761960156	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.496870813908	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.485814389079	There is broad consensus, 92 percent in the most recently poll of Americans want gun safety measures...
0.0	0.472714390047	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.360319808054	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.461800200552	First of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy, as you've indicated.
0.0	0.381713832518	That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable.
0.0	0.521571711505	Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force.
0.0	0.35220505413	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.348050745448	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.447444424945	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.480536843125	This nation is the most powerful military in the world.
0.0	0.43965582315	Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.
0.0	0.405154130287	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.387373756778	And America's best days are in front of us if we move forward together.
0.0	0.48972385396	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.168648285041	Kathie, I think -- Kathie the...
0.0	0.389903465839	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.32300257524	You really can't.
0.0	0.371669420568	Ted can change his mind.
0.0	0.385946085728	Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.
0.0	0.410956936333	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.412967351308	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.524149503331	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.371170092198	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.340796951705	Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.
0.0	0.243600850523	That's what we believe in.
0.0	0.423944317073	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.485411589276	And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity.
0.0	0.401744264454	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.3779931143	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.421521257634	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.354145890465	It cannot solely be America's fight.
0.0	0.456471828755	The Libyans turned out for one of the most successful, fairest elections that any Arab country has had.
0.0	0.310764279981	Listen, we can solve immigration.
0.0	0.544562648663	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.303187745987	I gotta do it, Dad.
0.0	0.271196163276	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.351685510916	Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months.
0.0	0.286837096945	... Well, no, no.
0.0	0.423720705844	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.293139703373	Because a lot of people said, "He'll never run.
0.0	0.472780153773	There were parts of that bill which agree with parts -- I disagree.
0.0	0.371180707401	As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe.
0.0	0.42068070829	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.5254293021	But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it.
0.0	0.514667719464	And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.333123103466	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
0.0	0.226016142873	It can happen.
0.0	0.41742047641	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.438005773756	And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.
0.0	0.524310708144	When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish Glass-Stegall.
0.0	0.296197604745	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.378057014644	John, may I -- may I interject here?
0.0	0.333108316801	Because I've seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime.
0.0	0.444374663061	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.392036697021	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.513699465195	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.393426334579	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
0.0	0.328893573281	Thank you for that question.
