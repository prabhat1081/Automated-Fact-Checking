0.0	0.341511118589	You know, Ted didn't show up.
0.0	0.5	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.467330367718	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.509652119967	And that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity -- kill people who are unarmed who should not be killed, they must be held accountable.
0.0	0.454503900045	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.312796781288	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.387031183528	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.442794960984	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.301166781116	So Hillary and I have a difference.
0.0	0.439162426612	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.357405324815	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.488022630389	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.440881815807	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.477446081508	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.
0.0	0.353823113551	May I respond?
0.0	0.463655322581	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.422552963349	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.
0.0	0.394516813734	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.474427872601	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.5	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
0.0	0.434023174876	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.314697785751	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.5	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.434055651027	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.299374115593	I'm going to tell you -- thank you.
0.0	0.433040707078	They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.
0.0	0.398038554433	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.377867438918	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.508861935056	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.5	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.272917590339	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.505192361358	And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young, old, everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard.
0.0	0.461156048096	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.359199069244	Al Qaida was based in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.240795860606	You bet they do.
0.0	0.380694381508	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.291956155514	All right.
0.0	0.465906917986	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.396872966554	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.28498036513	I don't like that.
0.0	0.385627167454	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.466705137904	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.409184443991	And the answer is: Because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda.
0.0	0.292679878078	We listen to you and -- and then we act.
0.0	0.165832888006	slot.
0.0	0.263385364933	Very valuable.
0.0	0.428471633641	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.420858608912	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.44727431269	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.41614179672	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.321271253822	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.38715986275	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.403165644567	We bailed out Wall Street.
0.0	0.5	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.387115424406	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.464210163874	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.461702284032	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.485013184048	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.389156937765	I would just...
0.0	0.241049445802	And God bless America.
0.0	0.461132228997	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.371130368833	They had a plan that was good.
0.0	0.426498147037	We are already de-conflicting air space.
0.0	0.462496766046	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.370659487478	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.474477084916	When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.448589469593	Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place.
0.0	0.484637104085	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.380532456609	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.470392784723	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.339981590756	And we should be a welcoming nation.
0.0	0.404217523403	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.393793444841	But they're killing us economically.
0.0	0.5	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
0.0	0.367838850636	That's the future of banking in America.
0.0	0.471481032962	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.424126836216	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.177927148247	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.287674176252	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.476094537211	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.462199768873	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.470280112146	I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.
0.0	0.182177745899	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.458865895188	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.436638172771	The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.
0.0	0.409159516112	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.41253045588	There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better.
0.0	0.387789486745	... and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.597929793896	Again...
0.0	0.345243990688	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.293607030414	Don't know that.
0.0	0.301137040549	I've gotta do it."
0.0	0.34392956755	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.5	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.368100704836	We've been at this a couple of years.
0.0	0.297700685267	We're dying.
0.0	0.5	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.376464785154	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.407906546058	But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that.
0.0	0.373682443574	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.353868815965	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.5	When he brought forward the "Gang of Eight" bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.
0.0	0.5	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
0.0	0.468297093713	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.
1.0	0.444732839617	I think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street...
0.0	0.406767899189	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.425054877474	I watched the video of Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.35577426558	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.2524787794	We all understand that.
0.0	0.369110076111	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.338663560937	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.441914424608	... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message.
1.0	0.5	A $5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.372707565839	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.315037928635	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
0.0	0.5	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.473051176275	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.14822507947	No, he doesn't.
1.0	0.746136414827	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
0.0	0.244727523674	That's the difference.
0.0	0.375255687266	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.5	We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.
0.0	0.262671919476	it won't happen.
0.0	0.5	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.442308289518	And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them.
0.0	0.489030562008	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.5	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.380073278003	I would like to see it updated.
0.0	0.343322137177	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.492053465322	Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.
0.0	0.405769108894	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.408638353452	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.530526314247	I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains.
0.0	0.417192078927	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.403133594061	It cannot solely be America's fight.
0.0	0.407900415173	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.513527343454	We got it done in my state by leading with principal and that's what we need to do as a party for comprehensive gun safety.
0.0	0.453539280887	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.340565170291	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.
0.0	0.395890149433	We have to do away with the strawman proposal.
0.0	0.510088444605	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.47052921089	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.371102779557	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
0.0	0.378880096681	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
0.0	0.429437171984	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.395891876675	That means education.
0.0	0.417702089507	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.491209699552	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.452205763894	No hour is too short, no dollar too small.
0.0	0.474397807418	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.517647341469	And, also, acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration, and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners.
0.0	0.395733797471	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.419749511906	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.484611711578	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.421164728601	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.371429068175	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.466154032941	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.473442481104	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.451294959652	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.329462143647	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.507832893033	I think we need major reform in the military, making it more cost effective, but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us.
0.0	0.406511775413	I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
0.0	0.430688706297	Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.
0.0	0.398465391639	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.41484604589	Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice.
0.0	0.169015696753	Yeah.
0.0	0.489030919905	Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.
0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.5	For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check.
0.0	0.472283818673	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.4887703437	And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that.
0.0	0.438446337168	I started off -- thank you -- I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said -- and I love my father.
0.0	0.454040542097	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.462397798226	So I believe that, in fact, this country needs to move towards a living wage.
0.0	0.468791697819	... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before.
0.0	0.290967862575	That's the job.
0.0	0.5	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
0.0	0.453630177475	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.507273769663	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.336632409535	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.389348611601	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.441035473153	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.518873490126	But at the end of the day, what you have right now are millions of Americans working two or three jobs because their wages that they are earning are just too low.
0.0	0.482143720953	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.455284498446	Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day.
0.0	0.382557895491	We should be supportive of that effort.
0.0	0.213217292802	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.291956155514	That's not right.
0.0	0.438852218175	And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.
0.0	0.380341859164	I said, "I don't need it.
0.0	0.336620983226	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.494491889064	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.423791905529	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.5	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
0.0	0.253733521174	We get a traitor.
0.0	0.51346083577	And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.
0.0	0.436261047706	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.458130628474	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.511852633933	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.460680306809	We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents.

0.0	0.597929793896	And here's why.
0.0	0.490470453721	So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.
0.0	0.491265213659	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.

0.0	0.489187446226	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.415478310448	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.

0.0	0.45958451041	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.
0.0	0.510180482655	First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster.
0.0	0.481167197217	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.475505391476	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.480843084105	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.392282667618	It's interesting that Jeb mentions the book.

0.0	0.410937475303	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.357413592641	The Secretary's obviously right.
0.0	0.465042257799	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.

0.0	0.447805996917	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.

0.0	0.513976471382	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.433988427188	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
1.0	0.782208488263	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
0.0	0.299157705387	But the poll numbers have.
1.0	0.519529360592	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.43403667356	You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet...
0.0	0.490399963747	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.470119706861	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.5	As Americans, we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet, but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies, to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability.
0.0	0.364989475067	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.513621032093	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.440515065624	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.461935085619	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.411719439502	I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria.
0.0	0.297996940283	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.393652610296	What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.
0.0	0.468164832785	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.454849836688	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.457236782064	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.43729314903	We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be -- and -- and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody.
0.0	0.398314890226	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.47317142198	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.288766974315	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.451943874347	And what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.418047616642	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.479241982902	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.278127805471	This is an emergency.
0.0	0.437351157297	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.469468391048	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.375573455809	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.314697785751	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.446717544254	And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem.
0.0	0.426529499441	And it has three parts.
0.0	0.475461258795	I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil.
0.0	0.481537519545	We have to end -- education has to be local.
0.0	0.533618487489	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.457426659978	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.49100394731	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.
0.0	0.367299858176	They're killing us.
0.0	0.348108168661	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.460691093933	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.395273173178	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.419426025608	And Abdullah said something recently, very important.
0.0	0.352382390352	Thousands.
0.0	0.447755810496	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.444391028925	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.442752247808	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.445100320114	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.456951836383	And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition, including Russia, to help us destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.181023227447	It's a joke.
0.0	0.407877492259	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.439843115133	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.420818490229	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.42307176173	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.
1.0	0.748797146552	Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.
0.0	0.458614417659	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
1.0	0.773452316463	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.5	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.430478824063	If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.
0.0	0.361331032578	They are not going to go away on their own.
0.0	0.441495101313	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.448906341269	I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
0.0	0.494481109644	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.405158208674	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.44997991277	And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting.
0.0	0.484588708992	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.445097486863	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
0.0	0.506899963289	I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.
0.0	0.385608035388	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.450527493303	And I understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary.
0.0	0.510759545202	Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day.
0.0	0.41056678028	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.
0.0	0.28498036513	They don't like that.
0.0	0.295475711976	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.382759454149	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.185856248441	Oh.
0.0	0.353214239938	Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.
0.0	0.46660747585	Well, you know, governor, I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010.
0.0	0.459327366602	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.358213777916	That is why we need to make...
0.0	0.533702879473	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.509954611874	You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.
0.0	0.236669280049	And guess what?
0.0	0.487478720193	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.475795821542	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.14822507947	You don't have to.
0.0	0.521882284331	Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military.
0.0	0.5	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.43289791422	Marco opposed this because they made a deal.
0.0	0.415686010037	And people are saying, "What's going on?
1.0	0.482688976223	And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent.
0.0	0.377392642657	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.432553276796	It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.
0.0	0.394176415375	They like to ask direct questions.
0.0	0.390631930194	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.366503413868	We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?
0.0	0.442803521046	Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server.
0.0	0.466352450016	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.291956155514	Right.
0.0	0.309429906128	We saw that in Egypt.
0.0	0.40566100237	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.476542428328	But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
0.0	0.45358844713	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.310100256421	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.454578509276	John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.
0.0	0.484629653805	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.43258226682	They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
0.0	0.481991161453	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.5	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.398593054955	That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable.
0.0	0.367900713722	I think this is a very difficult issue.
0.0	0.408939979877	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.403348017194	But I have another one, Ford.
0.0	0.404354342308	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
1.0	0.451005741703	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.436163702696	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.308930655705	I like it.
0.0	0.258918090437	They were wrong.
0.0	0.169015696753	Yeah.
0.0	0.397985595124	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.342327350533	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.258901088302	But I would add this.
0.0	0.363815215427	We can build the fence.
0.0	0.468833977996	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.443281485377	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.532076352806	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.5	You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent.
0.0	0.392615442704	You learn that threats always change.
0.0	0.468301403662	I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.
0.0	0.45892254782	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.5	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.427412933242	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.450568442746	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.597929793896	So...
0.0	0.438631849219	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.513162780747	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.43010922369	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.341192161159	I think I'm actually a very nice person."
0.0	0.424392400369	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.385132552185	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.430342155916	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.
0.0	0.418910060734	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.421301564553	That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.453383632295	They're controlled fully -- they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
0.0	0.319315832702	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.465745890911	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.434953113393	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.416467023945	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.459424007927	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.455964530423	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.414711657836	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.423379999288	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.462306795229	When was the last time you heard China is killing us?
0.0	0.435036925035	May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care?
0.0	0.417629802402	Well, I just want to quickly add...
0.0	0.458379830077	Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable?
0.0	0.286525963493	We have the opposite thinking.
0.0	0.47320117908	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.478212976155	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.404485895635	Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.
0.0	0.175013333486	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.469475248544	But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector.
1.0	0.832018958889	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.409111951444	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.478329897572	The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress.
0.0	0.597929793896	...
0.0	0.371208282839	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.454540736105	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.440259390456	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.397882780695	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.
0.0	0.420535873453	Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate.
0.0	0.448768557128	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.417827812018	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.509086161492	And remember the $5 billion Web site?
0.0	0.345906656159	All of these are very difficult issues.
0.0	0.393281343319	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.445491656282	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
0.0	0.463300640074	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.406498414755	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.472956555434	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.360715171372	Well, thanks for having me.
0.0	0.471198492339	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.356011531642	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.328750737878	Bottom line.
1.0	0.507908344872	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.489776681943	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.316031149551	We need that thinking.
0.0	0.367685928113	What have you got now?
0.0	0.453353471165	I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.
0.0	0.597929793896	You do.
0.0	0.472959774007	We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
0.0	0.462232406259	And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world.
0.0	0.412366168079	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.361555214429	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.256051748882	See?
0.0	0.5	As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.
0.0	0.41325674753	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.312814428177	Marco, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.391484018553	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.437049025772	I don't get any money from Wall Street.
0.0	0.217511881656	Wait for what?
0.0	0.346380748575	We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
0.0	0.466820143219	I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.
0.0	0.453440334227	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.39330711766	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.437782165616	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.4770233445	I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.
0.0	0.422004812641	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
0.0	0.315331726933	My oldest daughter's a teacher.
1.0	0.718032261741	I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.
0.0	0.442304666634	When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.
0.0	0.400982126026	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.418386066334	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.414255793843	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.436899790356	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.444766070545	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.420295624735	But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said.
0.0	0.481211795809	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.388788963853	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.196833246745	Dynamically.
0.0	0.40382006251	But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.
0.0	0.373479092479	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.475677123929	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.505392530512	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.37815798745	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.476214952071	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.422654671883	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.194531505215	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.410980995799	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.332138006704	We needed 60.
0.0	0.455381546436	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.349746006047	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.489450539964	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.454372141984	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.40609602627	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.262960943296	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.407825808336	White people?
0.0	0.384856510977	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.461979923644	There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction.
0.0	0.391795022084	I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs.
0.0	0.417349484816	It's not just Wall Street.
0.0	0.5	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.381786377946	And there are many ways of doing it.
1.0	0.300062620626	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
1.0	0.778191365051	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.395359109714	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.478065946811	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.384212440568	They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it."
0.0	0.356224725093	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.147432964743	John.
0.0	0.258154106181	Check it out.
0.0	0.436269108367	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.465474490381	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.457063753279	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.
0.0	0.390058555713	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.460801909342	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.
0.0	0.291956155514	That's right.
0.0	0.413075401234	We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.
0.0	0.435484508701	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.410545141544	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.451786486227	Saudi Arabia without us is gone.
0.0	0.361028149578	So I've watched the politicians.
0.0	0.394415482276	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.505311571206	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.477238408151	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.471478692237	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.473801875305	I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.
0.0	0.439596580887	And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.
0.0	0.445464254068	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
1.0	0.793411138393	And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.
0.0	0.435571323626	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.540306722543	We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government.
0.0	0.409149105803	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.442394868947	We can have debt-free college in the United States.
0.0	0.372981280882	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.
0.0	0.448474535641	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.463381016356	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.452930250283	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.46362546933	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.46044876653	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.444437780547	Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.
0.0	0.360324768861	Let me just -- let me just...
0.0	0.451995947876	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.420486868929	I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace.
0.0	0.256413027634	Please go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.485992466241	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.456826294928	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.275518343761	You know that.
0.0	0.452591138655	... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.382157427698	We need to figure this out together.
0.0	0.479573814783	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.400979888563	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.460520318814	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.514333346754	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.269657128264	But it will be...
0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.458661120924	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.457648206592	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.492765276358	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.478701198477	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.47094919708	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.597929793896	No.
0.0	0.366748339475	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.5	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.335809187321	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.427554913056	There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out.
0.0	0.1247146829	Chris?
0.0	0.380709637064	And look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that.
0.0	0.538833924865	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.372758955558	You know, I've always had a great deal of respect.
0.0	0.513405626908	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.406323538877	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.439148217555	And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.
0.0	0.244849337057	You do legislation.
0.0	0.357023602192	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.402860012721	And some, I assume, are good people.
0.0	0.5	We increased education funding by 37 percent.
0.0	0.486620751075	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.419297700775	But states need to do more as well.
0.0	0.430119497333	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.443594969562	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
0.0	0.450296771511	We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.409419015016	They are going to have to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.39284703362	They can't even answer simple questions.
0.0	0.307082606346	They started in Iowa.
0.0	0.414060458578	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.17546301285	I won't be doing that.
0.0	0.358449552107	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.290432021337	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.275518343761	I know.
0.0	0.383433869356	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.458404877372	We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.
0.0	0.480264077708	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.357446684897	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.358358830771	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.444491366582	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.207487114135	OK.
0.0	0.5	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.275518343761	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.362462531922	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.459107567322	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.480972871797	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.349648597054	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.341086504694	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.478514125141	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.272723611649	No, I don't think so.
0.0	0.354529185458	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.470169775967	It had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.469036365253	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.453592743894	There's too much -- it's like -- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
0.0	0.447921887535	You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911.
0.0	0.270259667479	We overcame the NRA's objections.
0.0	0.448060884511	He's actually a negative force.
0.0	0.467048075959	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.437624386129	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.408858414988	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.514295963287	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.343010571177	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.5	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.40335033371	And I -- I thought, if I didn't jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this.
0.0	0.455309827427	Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, "Rand, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.46130976858	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.514848330012	We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party.
0.0	0.467101730882	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.308667749855	That's a drag on the economy.
0.0	0.377655357912	And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.
0.0	0.373139520829	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.5	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.
0.0	0.384509204469	How are these people gonna lead us?
0.0	0.470303749723	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.464351036658	At the same time we're doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform.
0.0	0.430844623405	Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values.
0.0	0.451759396001	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.514443877492	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.473664652999	And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.
0.0	0.597929793896	Megyn?
0.0	0.415714975571	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.450436850787	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.42301025519	The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.437117747256	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.444719663021	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.392870203217	You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes.
0.0	0.489523654591	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.393739616089	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.490815776275	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.343927499267	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.430089215043	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.454849367158	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.44560269959	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.447428867662	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.441058847067	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
0.0	0.442796842212	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.430795210798	Let's put the gun makers and sellers on notice that they're not going to get away with it.
0.0	0.509966351877	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
1.0	0.798391783983	Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?
0.0	0.434970656248	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.462740651074	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.470796109881	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.366760159495	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.45007824631	So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out.
0.0	0.456911467127	But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.
0.0	0.427219894078	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.275518343761	And you know what?
0.0	0.457467190022	We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended.
0.0	0.466990096711	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.47147622918	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.
0.0	0.521641932065	Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.
0.0	0.478883818553	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.176994316665	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.445747373751	They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America.
0.0	0.475301896411	And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.
0.0	0.445763456341	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.471241262323	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.454761760132	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.244899680985	It's not great again.
0.0	0.483844969962	I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
0.0	0.426907875531	We have got to come forward with a consensus that in fact will work.
0.0	0.527554129337	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.468099859222	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
0.0	0.35229276401	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.216607611884	And it has been amazing to me.
0.0	0.311676609421	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.430430956408	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.512579127259	At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.
0.0	0.400933155235	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.373982270774	You don't serve us.
0.0	0.417565659042	Give people a chance.
0.0	0.5	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.373729117224	You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches.
0.0	0.490183679625	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.442513726123	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.392747516883	I mean, my dad went to college on a G.I.
0.0	0.475294207907	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.458758179981	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.597929793896	But...
0.0	0.473914289725	I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.
0.0	0.477628692598	I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.
0.0	0.4133449368	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.209256038581	And that's what's happening.
0.0	0.408691284262	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.411741739413	But it was also the cascading effects that followed that.
0.0	0.597929793896	...
0.0	0.597929793896	Why is that?
0.0	0.444803779601	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.45163728225	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.480234527427	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.281200177003	Are you not running?
0.0	0.147432964743	John?
0.0	0.353913877969	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.395797196631	I've prosecuted terrorists.
0.0	0.5	Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors.
0.0	0.505707045652	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.188255145755	So be very, very careful.
0.0	0.299422279359	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.514163312214	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.475705969139	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.225468482491	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.399009798846	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.436211851977	I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party's nominee.
0.0	0.477069199991	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.404446353231	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.406567256116	We went after those who had attacked us.
0.0	0.493196472572	I've employed -- I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
0.0	0.427425617377	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.365092951765	... And start taking advice...
0.0	0.355273994329	You have a bigger problem with China.
0.0	0.236669280049	And guess what?
0.0	0.409380662331	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.448405432516	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.436712084334	When we put money into the hands of working people, they're going to go out and buy goods, they're going to buy services and they're going to create jobs in doing that.
0.0	0.462671372926	Of course the United States must lead.
0.0	0.341148045239	I like Marco Rubio.
1.0	0.817351860072	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.51132600897	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.5	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.380156131934	That is a pledge that I'm making.
0.0	0.379555151867	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.425120265894	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.481989563015	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.534256731057	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.344213793499	Can you believe this?
0.0	0.449914422476	Number two, we had a really good plan.
0.0	0.46522376653	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.392351784856	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.452044371915	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.428542397125	When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.
0.0	0.433807495213	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.334005724057	Look at my family.
0.0	0.411016425516	And, here's what she said to the American people.
0.0	0.434606765557	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.411039979236	Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
0.0	0.352431139304	But you would index it -- you would index it to the median wage.
0.0	0.492554513541	I -- you know, know that Senator Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers.
0.0	0.491220564562	Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin.
0.0	0.391601095047	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.367820430616	It's virtually useless.
0.0	0.33366764502	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.401012383753	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.473254965128	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.406836313168	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.291382098725	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.5	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.470783649173	I think it's fair to say that Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America, but the issue is...
0.0	0.412390342137	Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope.
0.0	0.253583072681	I'm ready.
0.0	0.293144015079	Now I'm not doing that...I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?
0.0	0.487642953099	Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.363562052663	I mean, that's a fact.
0.0	0.400331320921	Can I just say this...
0.0	0.5	ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.
0.0	0.483364169536	So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act.
0.0	0.43960518053	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.510494758036	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
1.0	0.756780194231	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.414079365414	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.389245397436	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.597929793896	That is...
0.0	0.461855531172	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.445855190894	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.366493435403	I said, "I don't know."
0.0	0.463912824579	And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty.
0.0	0.489098295448	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.3974353392	And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party, but of President Obama.
0.0	0.5	And I was determined to do everything that I could to make VA health care the best in the world, to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending.
0.0	0.446470615601	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.386276681797	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.485582837624	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.421583225929	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.398111180647	First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.
0.0	0.442003741883	How can you get people to vote for you?"
0.0	0.347957933993	You have all of these disastrous airports.
0.0	0.39040272448	So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.
0.0	0.490084358383	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.339450071633	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.458299497675	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.427518847058	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.466155138504	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.172188732553	We can't.
0.0	0.461299400849	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.485901543969	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.439389055873	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
0.0	0.410905168769	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.291956155514	Right.
0.0	0.457179163428	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.411889633791	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.46443073933	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.368422868857	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.370960271092	It all will be scrutinized.
0.0	0.49064472942	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.469892669363	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.3857594913	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.480920689036	Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that's not good enough.
0.0	0.34193669397	There are no simple solutions.
0.0	0.432877514819	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.293024334479	Becky --
0.0	0.420466750325	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.27789019178	Your prosecute criminals.
1.0	0.485035952629	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.387546554091	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.429909935699	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.5	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.48643486698	We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally.
0.0	0.486669890481	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.401526691785	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.30398164263	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.225200095971	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.46319006612	All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.
0.0	0.332814719875	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.409799397738	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.414975440363	We'll be filing it right on time.
0.0	0.40227804932	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.533264880964	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.458478378774	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
0.0	0.4445420783	We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear.
0.0	0.477257311913	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.373790766952	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.407320600021	We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.
0.0	0.26054457109	He can't have it both ways.
0.0	0.487567898257	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.
0.0	0.39262121293	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.45059567177	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.34396430201	they expect to get something.
0.0	0.40911065677	But this is what we also have to say.
0.0	0.212477901405	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.476327058196	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.397716624287	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.5	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.511372392122	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.41071361654	And he asked me to support that.
0.0	0.440834614531	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.280406221485	You're right.
0.0	0.415206402189	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.304446308046	Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.316568037698	... Well, no, no.
0.0	0.452751285154	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.454233790852	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.277850723528	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.385210262964	Now I want to go back something.
0.0	0.47797445192	There's no nation on earth that comes close to that number.
0.0	0.402321924897	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.452255542084	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.348595737419	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.110857774384	David...
0.0	0.479104180919	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
0.0	0.464178695519	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.475177851866	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.420164351722	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.430581941562	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.436277473176	Number one, we're going to keep ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.508593188346	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.423687264599	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
1.0	0.4713819494	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.454204301109	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.394487488542	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.376966738881	Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.
0.0	0.391179976676	So, yes, this has developed.
0.0	0.5	We haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.
0.0	0.478595805806	According to the economists -- who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying -- that $24 trillion -- we're very close -- that's the point of no return.
0.0	0.480378610655	So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.
0.0	0.295776797941	We don't need that.
0.0	0.353756235843	But you don't hear that from anybody else.
0.0	0.424046479486	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.458825093134	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.447302902582	I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.44063423135	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.350206975079	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.375165953565	We must anticipate these threats before they happen.
0.0	0.313398215656	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.209192050437	Reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.485720134348	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.284153384925	My plan is there.
0.0	0.516892701804	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.401614988045	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.458129185836	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
1.0	0.753668548553	That's wrong.
0.0	0.360324768861	Let me just...
0.0	0.375967532017	... against Islam -- radical Islam -- if you're not for border security.
0.0	0.308057871359	We don't win.
0.0	0.367877097019	Listen, we can solve immigration.
0.0	0.419648216966	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.296069209463	Illegal.
0.0	0.187844975541	So did you, Marco.
0.0	0.423577010549	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.5	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.454445792582	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.518226612971	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.481376162636	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.465471287992	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.426819995552	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.254645317756	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.464254323741	We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president.
0.0	0.427785982886	Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.
0.0	0.463011067122	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.473346727972	You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?
0.0	0.43611602227	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.420795395385	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.479308223573	We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.
0.0	0.384993882732	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
1.0	0.769949163646	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.393144214584	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.401107688803	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.439456385415	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.5	I am proud that I was the first member of Congress to take Americans over the Canadian border to buy breast cancer drugs for one-tenth the price they were paying in the United States.
0.0	0.475538120672	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
0.0	0.470022491175	We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations.
0.0	0.461015822687	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.328750737878	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.472546937755	We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.
0.0	0.359883547308	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.388556166043	I never said that.
0.0	0.452126202111	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.438816184235	And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.
0.0	0.3883457792	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.425382128071	And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in.
0.0	0.509650139826	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.341348338522	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.442816323921	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.471788057257	We actually took action to do these things and as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families.
0.0	0.466775262332	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.476993000915	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
0.0	0.442839893613	That is our government today.
0.0	0.441700095479	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.372849117726	We don't need more of the same solutions.
0.0	0.398646121875	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.405894903594	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.207487114135	OK.
0.0	0.401643221166	You know why three?
0.0	0.363833536986	Let's do more -- let's do more than reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.474437578852	I met recently with some members of the Chaldean Christian communities and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months.
0.0	0.467421103754	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.509043117173	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.467878717463	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.427744340931	I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?
0.0	0.26492277686	Yes.
0.0	0.364266816759	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.234140666826	No, Martha, I would not.
0.0	0.42407794708	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.441700130582	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.416927095266	Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.
0.0	0.457310016083	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.27072758544	...before I go.
0.0	0.284940027947	Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.365578693686	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.597929793896	Not at all.
0.0	0.5	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.293860340936	Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid.
0.0	0.439405984142	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.597929793896	I have...
0.0	0.403681737396	We need to move aggressively now.
0.0	0.0975079571099	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.487114127249	But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone.
0.0	0.388040981939	And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.
0.0	0.402340591731	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.444001801346	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.484425941414	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?
0.0	0.423082379576	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.5	$5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.512800125712	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.490228525734	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.322400476822	And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.
0.0	0.378309877948	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.483037425608	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.47149736462	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.422373153131	This ties into campaign finance reform.
0.0	0.455835213276	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.391299886149	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.474438104626	You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.
0.0	0.439889394647	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.37856013386	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.440940860277	We actually passed a living wage.
0.0	0.494123150414	And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.
0.0	0.321669334325	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.424957636651	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.422978257609	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.535108355487	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.464636870064	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.46252339126	It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.447482732016	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.
0.0	0.481774366914	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.231993078702	I win.
0.0	0.433928832497	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.414953761426	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.469468439051	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.484436733329	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.406530749973	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.376116359947	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.262661833393	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.426819995552	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.258918090437	We were wrong.
0.0	0.445515821128	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.449054127468	I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.
0.0	0.47283720164	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.480541154334	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.32214205894	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
1.0	0.5	But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works.
1.0	0.836701410704	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.45721962715	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.356857349936	Can we stop?
0.0	0.401141385703	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.300299330221	We were attacked from Afghanistan.
0.0	0.434038016622	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.422102217381	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.396016202748	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.317534373618	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.453807644543	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.43030181545	Rebuild the country's infrastructure.
0.0	0.293607030414	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.298213666258	Say again?
0.0	0.459749749591	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.23374976027	And he'll say, "Please, please, please."
0.0	0.486864706465	Then, in 2008, you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying that we don't need those regulations on the federal level and now you're coming back around here.
0.0	0.346180608505	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.241186617926	That's not fair.
1.0	0.437845299262	Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.
0.0	0.3291683924	I've laid out...
0.0	0.436651041536	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.
0.0	0.490891152191	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.453237473259	If you want to make it into the middle class -- I'm not saying in all cases -- we need plumbers, and we need carpenters, and electricians, that's for sure, and they should get help as well.
0.0	0.411415219085	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.
0.0	0.486967075567	Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.
0.0	0.309906570454	We saw a dictator overthrown.
0.0	0.519557055311	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.464539166887	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.365733345104	We never dreamt we'd ever see it."
0.0	0.37838861499	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.360350596524	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.203416590708	I'll do it.
0.0	0.468578416105	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.198536932861	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.344956660398	Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name.
0.0	0.477664078036	And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring.
0.0	0.452130536393	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.5	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.422650724355	And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?
0.0	0.444209554928	But I'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya, you would be looking at Syria.
0.0	0.450206490497	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.347932083765	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.455721650822	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.405355783655	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.51864100347	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.409159347405	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.479468671245	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.

0.0	0.473964878682	And, I would not that there's a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that's the EPA's blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline.
0.0	0.407178789837	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.597929793896	She did.
0.0	0.394006535261	In this building, in Trump Tower.
0.0	0.42093990992	I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena.
0.0	0.434518670176	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.404922896973	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.368637641106	We offered a lot more.
0.0	0.436623857294	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.358449552107	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.447461065388	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.392113802101	I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary...
0.0	0.434918693103	We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York.
0.0	0.466263936826	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.423640774664	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.528110647258	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.379986438151	They've got nothing but money.
0.0	0.488485744653	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.365360500868	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.467180523789	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.245255033277	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.46918244343	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.457102441212	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.5	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.351654510138	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.366930952753	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.287097363081	I don't care.
0.0	0.416593541896	That's what I understand is the request from the international...
0.0	0.421361226068	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
1.0	0.456448006746	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
1.0	0.845399030989	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.434194677927	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.462152852206	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.492672407745	I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support.
0.0	0.414419017888	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.373413206383	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.41027335805	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.291956155514	That's right.
0.0	0.416056329735	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.275631075097	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.463750888843	So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe.
0.0	0.353285126203	I believe we've got to go further.
1.0	0.847366918371	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.397030094079	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
0.0	0.384574673747	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.357919115165	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.39191005171	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
0.0	0.453652995133	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.377497447483	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.350172060997	There are thing that can be done.
0.0	0.455559330847	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.397076700301	So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.
0.0	0.1247146829	...Chris...
0.0	0.373349097918	I'm not using donors.
0.0	0.420288159782	That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.
0.0	0.450178631619	Making sure that Muslim Americans don't feel left out or marginalized at the very moment when we need their help.
0.0	0.485687248683	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
1.0	0.81226862593	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.422132807309	They come up to my office.
0.0	0.332733239253	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.400427274784	In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men.
0.0	0.418571317985	And your point is absolutely well taken.
0.0	0.443270559098	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.429801864154	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.390579496312	We are doing both at the same time.
0.0	0.5	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.426086685483	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.484049622042	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.432285017762	Last point.
0.0	0.370379392002	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.429671361497	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.447500436351	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.284182567719	I'm proud of my family.
0.0	0.4103821725	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.306792088851	So nice, thank you very much.
0.0	0.410962757288	And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...
0.0	0.486084984854	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.307997540762	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.411158531281	They are our first line of defense.
0.0	0.463904360273	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.393118604048	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.420257944182	You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization.
0.0	0.484957568506	It's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement.
0.0	0.427347161553	Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees.
0.0	0.14822507947	We haven't.
0.0	0.26247820881	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.520143686545	I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground.
0.0	0.228683385371	It's a disaster.
0.0	0.419702152628	Find out what I said to Greenspan.
0.0	0.408796559304	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.360829174101	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.510002309207	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.53048233368	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.417886433274	And it's impossible for our people here to compete.
0.0	0.456247354991	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.
0.0	0.396927018647	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.426647085824	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.24821776515	They have no choice.
0.0	0.548824655867	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.410693118836	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.512744015921	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.443353690814	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.365960945447	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.439994867949	But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.
0.0	0.412608620698	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.35577426558	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.440039820985	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.418669837379	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
1.0	0.5	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.338358627815	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.451461750782	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
0.0	0.525684486183	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.427196865057	I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work.
0.0	0.40336337506	You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.
0.0	0.295061393832	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.506380483239	Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system.
0.0	0.304820128764	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.419025300293	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.463532284912	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.411275294271	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.52087413869	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.433913958964	The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.
0.0	0.468630854262	And I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern.
0.0	0.405158833171	Our country has tremendous potential.
0.0	0.421912750443	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.419463513093	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.454004656135	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.423585997959	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.417599846653	We have people that aren't working.
0.0	0.5	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.402045963592	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.484791140916	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.449032049998	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.386899133471	I want immigration reform to pass.
0.0	0.242800162122	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.443174120712	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.379974655431	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.
0.0	0.240049963415	That's fine.
0.0	0.437218064251	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.5	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.488841093413	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.425114132676	... and say there is something more important than money.
1.0	0.82250844054	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
0.0	0.414249768869	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.470606659969	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.293607030414	But we don't know.
0.0	0.352779282527	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.35106424554	And Teddy Roosevelt is right.
0.0	0.465226200526	This is not a conflict where we send in the third divisions of Marines.
0.0	0.432112914843	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.446968761367	And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.
0.0	0.392103987496	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.428823677525	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.491555234494	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.383766135895	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.304709551963	We know about the Brits.
1.0	0.774749905182	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.437797769934	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.52929594211	In fact, American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the National Institute of Health and that we then tested through the FDA.
0.0	0.47107822208	The Iranians getting more of a presence in Syria, linking with Hezbollah, their proxy in Lebanon, would threaten Israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with Assad's future.
0.0	0.511970694141	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.344611014337	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.272430207954	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.402590355553	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.5	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.405368392343	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.320996168745	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.413567764234	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.3931313539	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.387823453643	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.406028533787	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.5	And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.
0.0	0.44676278213	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.406038207245	to save a company.
0.0	0.445771622917	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.478225972201	Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.
0.0	0.38243290696	Ted can change his mind.
0.0	0.439375784567	I've been to Ferguson, I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.
0.0	0.597929793896	...
0.0	0.417386673512	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.463235094576	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
0.0	0.442312315557	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.394566325103	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.45228930382	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.436174099741	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.458303442358	I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.
0.0	0.435652142584	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.506190328451	I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment.
0.0	0.420957351101	Medicare for all, single-payer system is the way we should go.
0.0	0.410793558001	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.491095700955	And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
0.0	0.316999287919	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.402769242479	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.374169267043	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.349555760179	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.494848676893	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
0.0	0.522653261046	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.342214738716	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.455474348727	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.
0.0	0.296464401492	They all have jobs.
0.0	0.43386515581	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.
0.0	0.47007405501	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.42798125777	Donald Trump, for example -- I'm glad -- I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him...
0.0	0.446432041117	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.43093898298	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.419648014957	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.475175020649	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.479684852924	We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt.
0.0	0.466460568836	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.397520327338	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.441193177629	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.40343037623	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
1.0	0.816016390312	In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.
0.0	0.301491790503	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.474898814474	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.401656214156	Their business model is greed and fraud.
0.0	0.437054368933	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.460562541201	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.389285897607	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.418844686188	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.435520430764	People came back from Iraq and Afghanistan without legs, without arms.
0.0	0.404210797597	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
0.0	0.403031009976	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.334895417636	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.486395038483	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.357256206669	Now, it's very interesting.
0.0	0.474337730794	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.429305327704	Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.
0.0	0.478465848852	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.157647138072	So should the UK, so should France.
0.0	0.417189039404	Well, I got it for two reasons.
0.0	0.406153379293	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.460246547014	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.4619362033	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.441909625582	Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.
0.0	0.367598784789	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.
0.0	0.440389331629	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.321146319829	Barack Obama wants to change America.
0.0	0.489949329304	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.411966961561	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.46839898247	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.489816643189	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.351203625177	The big banks--
0.0	0.458528314521	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.426522201055	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.344846807896	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.450732311515	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.38666952677	Bret, we're just starting.
1.0	0.838741687684	Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.
0.0	0.388208745778	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.275518343761	They know.
1.0	0.822753647485	And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.
0.0	0.275518343761	You know why?
0.0	0.419986813254	Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle."
0.0	0.432111204063	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.256203988795	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.597929793896	That's what he is.
0.0	0.420440170493	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.427613446244	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.469773821135	When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.416091494523	It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.
0.0	0.389919686964	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.472801671752	And if they have to be in the Middle East for 20 or 30 years no problem.
0.0	0.597929793896	This is 2016.
0.0	0.493415298589	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.484543054765	And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.
0.0	0.358333361699	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.278466759648	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.377793096932	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.444135010357	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.48198692487	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.351111835777	I know, Bret.
0.0	0.477141087503	Parents, and sons, and daughters and family members, and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them, we must remember this, that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century.
0.0	0.282236828399	They won't accept it.
0.0	0.479278433291	And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition.
0.0	0.446499622586	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.412140966044	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.456159646397	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.261825723401	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.5	I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone.
0.0	0.461356071914	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.488841093413	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.327420824645	And, look, there are profound differences...
0.0	0.431439287514	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.42909301601	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.
0.0	0.433381514868	I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
0.0	0.483727808045	You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?
0.0	0.455418665774	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.458548875648	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.510829717059	To tell Qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep.
0.0	0.3685352998	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.452315961651	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.379932705269	Marco can change his mind.
0.0	0.465683424983	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
0.0	0.452653465123	I do agree that in particular, Turkey and the Gulf nations have got to make up their minds.
0.0	0.448498525226	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.486731726042	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.388556166043	I never said that.
0.0	0.478070298746	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.406767899189	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.373520698343	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.439176237477	We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States.
0.0	0.467623655555	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.423946750541	If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
0.0	0.488246371672	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.4267649156	We've got the consensus, what we're lacking is political leadership...
0.0	0.453332031719	And we have people that are controlled by special interests.
0.0	0.478239633011	Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
0.0	0.387029346521	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.423944215717	The NSA is another big issue.
0.0	0.405830686895	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.344403365465	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.390579496312	All the time.
0.0	0.330446916836	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.454224124353	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.25263866253	Not assets."
1.0	0.802353000528	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.490705813718	They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.491039844188	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.456818446765	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.471731667452	But those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort.
0.0	0.42147030415	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.481669131611	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.417661401728	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
0.0	0.472009283181	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.492059796143	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.186067036802	Divide that out.
0.0	0.384571106647	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.49304944679	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.417657923185	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.435189999632	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.
1.0	0.795940905729	Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.476599487933	And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.
0.0	0.487204432682	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.279422319721	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.272703917154	That's not the America that I think we should be.
0.0	0.239544962346	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.313082082982	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.392878772464	He believes everything he stands for.
1.0	0.41413043686	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.415644289135	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.423102729555	... we will secure the border...
0.0	0.433845736119	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.418736546963	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.461652330289	People have invested a lot of energy into that.
0.0	0.380227163382	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.423207986648	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.423457884852	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.494948808297	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.458239759108	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.386778035874	The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering, these are not the perpetrators.
0.0	0.449162975575	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.284591790773	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.447946875468	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.312856120121	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.389637385889	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
1.0	0.5	But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.
0.0	0.441135210297	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.485608589962	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.424051805736	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.46997126596	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.448781258693	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.266444211474	He was on the board.
0.0	0.475163517068	These are often very long- term kinds of investments that have to be made.
0.0	0.417690098536	If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.
0.0	0.494812045412	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.433603605045	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.391621347054	So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has.
0.0	0.450953216113	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.444309430803	If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune.
0.0	0.301037059775	That's kind of a no-brainer.
0.0	0.46472418215	We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America.
0.0	0.465817550744	People have been paying it for years.
0.0	0.393084077779	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.492283696127	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.335884458442	I do not think it would come to that.
0.0	0.513425897112	And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion."
0.0	0.420149785208	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.401013477844	And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.
0.0	0.435660169979	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.247710057947	I was recruited to H.P.
1.0	0.469470304368	However, what Alan Krueger said in the piece you're referring to is that if we went to $15, there are no international comparisons.
0.0	0.398338371117	I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it.
0.0	0.408234027863	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.53470322905	I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.
1.0	0.464192174798	7 percent and 8 percent to go to college?
0.0	0.478002111257	... saying, no middle class tax raises.
0.0	0.464007376055	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.401643221166	You know why three?
0.0	0.408566786976	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.424219073751	And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.
0.0	0.382126818093	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.333654158847	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.418582841615	The no-fly zone, I would hope, would be also shared by Russia.
0.0	0.469951363781	Many are in this building.
0.0	0.2524787794	I understand.
0.0	0.397310411527	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.385126278218	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.415428954424	We have the U.N. Security Council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path.
0.0	0.316595290455	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.437838166626	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.44760578981	That can be done without profiling people.
0.0	0.597929793896	These...
0.0	0.493255358706	These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy, and our economic power in alignment with our principles.
1.0	0.507150428365	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.439733254872	They will not bring us -- believe me -- to the promised land.
0.0	0.389014737289	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.403081171923	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.428323047245	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.436605002997	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.362434973661	It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino.
0.0	0.282820223827	We know about the French.
0.0	0.475038958699	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.207487114135	OK?
0.0	0.244631495605	I love China.
0.0	0.454796562484	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.171255139834	Who are we kidding?
0.0	0.471823904567	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.465426492744	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.
0.0	0.370687169171	I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.
0.0	0.505219919138	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.441345367217	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.439262427557	I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security.
0.0	0.519367110045	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.379772428016	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.141429404648	Ford.
0.0	0.298743623212	I can do that.
0.0	0.447954611744	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.477736957563	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.391066304199	He's been a negative force.
0.0	0.427885484299	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.532153051955	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
1.0	0.486612333445	Well, we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists.
0.0	0.467003395299	Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.
0.0	0.466233832117	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.458570734018	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.465904787853	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.234140666826	And Martha...
0.0	0.374968027287	It's great to be at Trump Tower.
0.0	0.470153832848	I sell apartments for -- I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.
0.0	0.431242909462	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.239803889145	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.409899844243	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.450620432998	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.45433313053	We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.
0.0	0.38655050338	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.446869462609	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.
0.0	0.464841000209	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.459758397471	Now the Libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge ISIS from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.
0.0	0.46974080899	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.
0.0	0.248334271673	I think what is...
0.0	0.36821849096	In all due respect...
0.0	0.370238222723	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
0.0	0.484934733303	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...
0.0	0.484273724075	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
0.0	0.477281064099	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.284489379605	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.371208282839	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.438256672028	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.406124991396	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.416427580957	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.5	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
1.0	0.422819920002	A lot of people up there can't get jobs.
0.0	0.388551163017	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.529878159142	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.476029715683	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.465718107661	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
0.0	0.362625302704	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.334206739312	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.470098611945	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.169015696753	Yeah.
0.0	0.512793307185	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.459942294846	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.5	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.475317862571	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.472245062629	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
0.0	0.463129240432	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
1.0	0.813344017153	Very few children.
0.0	0.275104197868	And I hear their speeches.
0.0	0.38126201876	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.291956155514	Right?
0.0	0.433817685451	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
1.0	0.749470014097	He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.
0.0	0.34188860597	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.409386899018	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.442988900481	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
0.0	0.45471107555	But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.
0.0	0.416912699567	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.287604546499	Oh, great.
0.0	0.517563722217	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.47857384903	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.343121755648	Let me say on that...
1.0	0.833583589255	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.400302702376	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.468769868324	For example, it is outrageous that we don't have an opportunity for Medicare to negotiate for lower prices.
0.0	0.480459504172	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.428274889146	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.423753411231	No, I've never made a promise like that.
0.0	0.258984843737	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.494739344907	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.457786643961	I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
0.0	0.414128434306	End -- end Common Core.
0.0	0.366418340478	I say, "That's a terrible story.
0.0	0.481331350285	So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.
1.0	0.471523894319	He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage, and what its effects are.
0.0	0.268000347436	That's off the table...
0.0	0.380071672232	Now, what does that mean?
0.0	0.30191309439	There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.
0.0	0.463884503742	I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.5	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.415887205528	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.466401245162	But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything.
0.0	0.454194486472	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.394065791424	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.376863954163	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.482998209763	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.488336031191	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.474881056388	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.309062532999	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.369536312101	I beat China all the time.
0.0	0.505722983161	It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.
0.0	0.403306951074	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.505528682439	But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.455463539657	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.440044327885	First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, "they cannot have it all."
0.0	0.441774059471	Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.
0.0	0.408860959604	And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen.
0.0	0.453380365678	... and I encourage everybody watching this tonight to please, acknowledge that by going online at martinomalley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism.
0.0	0.460682625447	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.424279401642	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.5	And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina, and many other Republican states, that because of their right wing political ideology, are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.435216244355	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.283566150275	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.383114122127	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.390726303042	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.48293941395	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.192879253725	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.476509485908	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.475485449264	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.
0.0	0.483553804473	And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.
0.0	0.388324588261	So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.
0.0	0.34546461599	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.382173154244	But look, we didn't know what was happening next.
0.0	0.448355590103	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.475375748355	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.439536479805	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.335561200298	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.355804006381	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.370857899084	That means everything.
0.0	0.410178977371	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.360989975307	And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth.
0.0	0.348987534565	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.419874730799	The people don't work for us.
0.0	0.45508658321	But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance.
0.0	0.438304885621	And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before.
0.0	0.37092016747	This is revolutionary for education in America.
1.0	0.483414510298	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
1.0	0.709550595714	Today, we have 272.
0.0	0.425747641145	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.413476581619	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.420605296131	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.435899059754	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.393391320678	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.477159320793	We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.492644056621	I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department.
0.0	0.494137310233	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
0.0	0.483980396335	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.397475797506	And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a -- that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.
0.0	0.249922856099	Look what they did in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.468474793345	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.484678869165	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.
0.0	0.480099635544	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.519945573697	I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor, I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very, very powerful and most important of all jobs in the United States, the president, whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country.
0.0	0.462100744524	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.597929793896	No.
0.0	0.390668332894	How the hell can you vote for this guy?
0.0	0.5	Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts.
0.0	0.38277035699	Let me just say this...
0.0	0.390742862109	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.445449027274	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.248334271673	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.231584209498	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.445647015564	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.420356942798	I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...
0.0	0.396823748666	The world has changed.
0.0	0.385800808208	But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate.
0.0	0.248334271673	They think they are.
0.0	0.430297692684	And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives.
1.0	0.52878122643	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
1.0	0.473431867457	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.513238858688	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.479401705	We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.
0.0	0.432420187302	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.349889107516	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.259183939285	You're welcome.
1.0	0.820560329641	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.331572530051	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.39610221683	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.263603644394	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.467225324337	Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.
0.0	0.258918090437	He's wrong.
0.0	0.414270802785	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.455730877723	No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.
0.0	0.460910881469	And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.
0.0	0.338060185672	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.477835960643	I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out.
0.0	0.438788143293	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.443769267566	And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.
0.0	0.464589197527	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.427474562613	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.347365771709	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
0.0	0.5	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.420720075134	All of us want equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.44650485245	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.486021395756	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
0.0	0.363672838798	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.407934648326	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.397700933773	I have a comprehensive, tough plan.
0.0	0.456583821206	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.456608046123	Number one...
0.0	0.462504863268	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.491771996941	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.426298165868	Like, I'm standing here, I -- I watched the video of Senator Cruz.
0.0	0.345688080702	Chris I was mentioned in that question.
0.0	0.269245669143	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.516851357391	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.450040410007	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.359025670811	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.42036308699	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.277435313526	He sure did.
0.0	0.384012696412	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.372676057833	My background is different.
0.0	0.46245688497	We've enacted it in our state.
0.0	0.426552165758	We can triple the border patrol.
0.0	0.423983146081	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
0.0	0.483743515062	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.287415463425	That's what our parents and grandparents always did.
1.0	0.803258982927	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.
0.0	0.277178959897	We are rebuilding China.
0.0	0.486418663022	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.364457712468	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.387428107067	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.462458938664	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.401342230959	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.417535144498	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.158029508397	I am against the raids.
1.0	0.284330730095	We owe Japan more than that.
0.0	0.381385253109	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.5	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.366809386703	And I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate.
0.0	0.389136092233	But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything -- everything, they got away with it again.
0.0	0.338642445226	It's their money.
0.0	0.450747688874	Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region.
0.0	0.342069826841	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.375497976172	And I think that's the false choice...
0.0	0.486662199778	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.457716834253	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.425188542854	And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.
0.0	0.369708105107	She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.
0.0	0.314316174311	I said no.
0.0	0.389240514038	We need money.
0.0	0.31887695421	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.509821904498	That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.
0.0	0.531529789737	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.515934175876	Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.
0.0	0.385656617788	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.438159762616	This nation is the most powerful military in the world.
0.0	0.464409015912	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.244899680985	Great.
0.0	0.5	Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons.
0.0	0.42931677457	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
1.0	0.717649275004	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.475348128184	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.311996849343	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.51878149505	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.421624542396	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.422805478322	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
1.0	0.769044893661	They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
0.0	0.413839424033	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.401079716497	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.474054855178	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.488347384587	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
1.0	0.852365029686	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.408418281729	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.289587701091	He's an entertaining guy.
0.0	0.597929793896	No.
0.0	0.269657128264	They will not.
0.0	0.51501524235	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.406177135373	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.381167074188	I need your help.
0.0	0.480026395397	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.487363506423	Clearly the best piece of veterans' legislation brought forth in decades.
0.0	0.360298676722	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.271337230363	It was terrible.
1.0	0.799273735956	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.487414696405	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.260163881142	Both served.
0.0	0.485113194447	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.443111274657	If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're (inaudible).
0.0	0.300383178463	He was a little teddy bear to me.
0.0	0.415214616151	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.468653458261	I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not.
0.0	0.367764391964	I said, "What's your problem?"
0.0	0.378618305347	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.465639529058	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.323382827124	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.482710345659	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.406605453534	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.337859021945	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.415940599087	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.
0.0	0.361298016552	Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth.
0.0	0.452087803076	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.284153384925	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.488309632437	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.446100012822	... and 85 percent of gun owners agree.
0.0	0.463220548922	That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities.
0.0	0.244108934966	That's my view.
0.0	0.416255033499	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.404767690577	There are hundreds of things like that.
0.0	0.520192109324	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.483978624683	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.476464000638	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
1.0	0.313085724886	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.423855888611	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.357958258204	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.358449552107	But let's be clear.
0.0	0.507063453241	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.43301734241	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.443941945855	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.460259015366	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.349761236596	I heard what they said.
0.0	0.321525241517	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.474592522023	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.426840312008	Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.420276703323	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.434821589569	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
0.0	0.465737522838	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.353326412877	And I believe he is absolutely right.
0.0	0.405111273359	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.485771240461	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.474348074705	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.183430849964	I love the Saudis.
0.0	0.425736648436	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
1.0	0.76372609268	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.366163233861	I think we're missing the point here.
0.0	0.475108819211	You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
0.0	0.494870114619	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.328668241007	I do respect Rand.
0.0	0.354706097993	There will be a process.
0.0	0.465861258507	Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.
0.0	0.5	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
0.0	0.410555430488	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.464159367789	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.339289392838	We've got to hate the Muslims."
0.0	0.440778684308	They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
0.0	0.283231390367	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.252097793081	This is the election...
0.0	0.310801676919	You have to lead.
0.0	0.30398164263	So, I thank you very much for that.
0.0	0.344160117557	It never happens.
0.0	0.482880429635	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.241044672523	You looking at me?
0.0	0.506487665754	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
0.0	0.447791209129	I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.
0.0	0.5	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.436028512335	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.438712973614	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.475096702829	We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
0.0	0.363361043401	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.408847781675	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.244914553206	How would we act?
0.0	0.484493564779	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.471273803346	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.508046569641	There was a minimum wage at the state level, and some places went higher.
0.0	0.403236618176	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.430364979274	And, yes, we are at war with those people.
1.0	0.729708593911	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.396996399362	You've got to go the extra mile.
0.0	0.417840287713	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
0.0	0.292219451661	The Obama administration.
0.0	0.480529213765	And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.
0.0	0.460291558483	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.29970479325	Let's be frank here.
0.0	0.409673750177	The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.
0.0	0.316855468123	So they put together this.
0.0	0.384614831357	We have people that are morally corrupt.
0.0	0.482361838772	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.338857518352	They've advertised that.
0.0	0.48221112146	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.393537305607	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.36376803812	That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.
0.0	0.517180592165	But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks.
0.0	0.412907487824	They can provide resources.
0.0	0.407708902677	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.407047291914	So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
0.0	0.451373253802	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.427103741952	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.280959520715	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.453107063089	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.276174498466	Megyn, that's the problem.
0.0	0.457543559073	But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you.
0.0	0.183430849964	No, I love them.
0.0	0.458710865539	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.475203478364	You're seeing cities like San Francisco, cities like Los Angeles doing it, and they are doing it well and workers are able to have more disposable income.
0.0	0.361804565957	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.348623875182	I love this country.
0.0	0.27224259704	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.523478669559	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.424185118704	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.266571759273	I don't want it.
0.0	0.449046230272	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.320104984582	Let's have a Democratic Syria.
0.0	0.447107315419	I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen.
0.0	0.5	Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.
0.0	0.51038959931	And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.
0.0	0.350474224668	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.307223066883	I think there is a consensus.
0.0	0.348258540127	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.493441638298	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.408010243374	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.361858596598	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.375656484306	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
0.0	0.457663520656	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.
0.0	0.597929793896	But what...
0.0	0.406897589962	I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis.
0.0	0.493485902932	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.401907304427	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
1.0	0.812614383861	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
1.0	0.773630345526	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.238637040432	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.467251084648	The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.
0.0	0.412018859469	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.476804736598	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.
0.0	0.415031094295	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.5	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.443189769026	We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground."
0.0	0.455728789294	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.378692888354	We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels.
0.0	0.338770965646	It's affordable for everybody.
0.0	0.492259773456	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.471008312035	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.25168628395	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.378650149009	And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.
0.0	0.432445561554	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.444423533252	So the fact is that we work for the people.
0.0	0.489065352911	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.5	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.38135895376	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.376128156185	I know the bad ones.
0.0	0.431088920715	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.381164549392	It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York.
0.0	0.288766974315	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.353067552221	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.437531741472	You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying.
0.0	0.473871842609	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.350639633964	We ended up with 56 votes.
0.0	0.456895153111	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.490398711762	Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.
0.0	0.291956155514	That is not right.
0.0	0.477653375281	Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top.
0.0	0.338848301609	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.446672983405	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
0.0	0.442829232647	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.348402422186	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.350821335701	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.248334271673	Think about that.
0.0	0.357230852002	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.
0.0	0.5	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.464483340505	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.447395627432	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.477903310103	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.49370955872	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.527053706241	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.301544754032	And I watch the speeches.
0.0	0.422349958756	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.
0.0	0.401176811828	I'll advertise my Web site as well.
0.0	0.484424643622	Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people.
0.0	0.407345917685	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.470087657494	You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?
0.0	0.383433869356	But actually I am.
0.0	0.367003829664	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.339429763804	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.509465793902	I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of State, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now.
0.0	0.4222589819	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.517238388776	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
0.0	0.519150010748	You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks.
0.0	0.451005760829	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.344759110834	They'll all come back.
0.0	0.5	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.395587028372	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
0.0	0.447898377222	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.453060562764	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.419038971732	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.524725358122	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.376662382709	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.52355973206	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.407041759159	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.5	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.
0.0	0.506682506748	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.475601390168	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
1.0	0.522718295867	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.450140184107	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.445594870327	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
0.0	0.492411683879	This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.
0.0	0.478721865105	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.404876181246	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.323341945497	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.375456345552	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.389534328152	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.392991698422	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.5	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.491365808331	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.371605534461	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.340024038841	It's called the politics.
1.0	0.8024932855	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.477686897683	I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries.
0.0	0.463544298147	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.382610472114	Man (ph), their mother's here as well.
0.0	0.451862541853	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.349400220612	Does anyone know this?"
0.0	0.46553843807	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
0.0	0.191082338758	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.485120729482	And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.
0.0	0.545970472146	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.322730323028	It's become more complicated.
0.0	0.521597444954	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.368983005652	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.472420939043	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.489386978493	We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.
0.0	0.473674245157	And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process.
0.0	0.474487791375	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.302128957799	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.335535729807	Those are all really positive developments.
0.0	0.489304679839	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.342188788325	It is a tragedy all over this country.
0.0	0.389813183019	Do the $12 and you would index it.
0.0	0.225200095971	Absolutely.
0.0	0.247994398624	So I would say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.362066603961	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.
0.0	0.333001445806	We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets.
0.0	0.5	It was the most highly sought after -- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
0.0	0.399186487498	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.344934414172	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.461150527319	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.411198945792	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.476323717043	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
0.0	0.280049954953	It's coming from more than Mexico.
0.0	0.427222414966	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.450953660136	If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country.
0.0	0.412141963073	We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
0.0	0.514396753047	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.314856626756	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.394946374059	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.391486444804	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.424363587577	Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values.
0.0	0.466476728361	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
0.0	0.29836902359	And it's-- it's a worthy debate.
0.0	0.479025191073	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.415356584703	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.447605139415	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.435216405634	If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship.
0.0	0.476884287898	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.527566383819	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.362613311933	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.258154106181	Check it out.
0.0	0.415763701631	We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game.
0.0	0.597929793896	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.349056640024	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.442485682185	And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.
0.0	0.5	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.437043665135	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.456458442587	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.409916868627	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.388863207857	But, I would also add this.
1.0	0.437491864696	That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.
0.0	0.33025311171	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.30117821962	I think any parent would be so proud of them.
0.0	0.467849978946	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.278723764326	And universities.
0.0	0.449399207091	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.505208881954	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.469999109448	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.311886177726	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.448803486308	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.425962855214	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.375261462246	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.387920383622	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
1.0	0.833806546629	Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education.
0.0	0.412801708333	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.511114194192	We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.
0.0	0.308930655705	I like them.
0.0	0.349827029948	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.417393747846	We need -- we need somebody -- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.
0.0	0.417888838568	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.376358065605	We will make America great again.
1.0	0.805831143387	Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world.

0.0	0.244899680985	How great is that?
0.0	0.454772029995	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.5	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.

0.0	0.480259588107	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.

0.0	0.380872398407	I'm an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I miss doing eye surgery, still get to do a little bit.
0.0	0.472175005951	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
0.0	0.479008363817	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.

0.0	0.31273551933	What are you going to do for my kids?
0.0	0.458335400963	But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding.
0.0	0.459303888687	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.401141385703	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.

0.0	0.480575238136	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.412173602325	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.463627042662	And that's only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.
1.0	0.757290581031	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.

0.0	0.506275766972	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.40566725991	That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.
0.0	0.429247388812	And America's best days are in front of us if we move forward together.
0.0	0.409213716717	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.518104163697	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.269657128264	I will not do that.
0.0	0.207487114135	OK.
0.0	0.462309724222	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.5	What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years.
0.0	0.5	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.510604244737	I led the effort, unfortunately unsuccessfully, against deregulation because I knew when you merge large insurance companies and investment banks and commercial banks it was not going to be good.
0.0	0.480415023418	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.344311592791	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.597929793896	Both.
0.0	0.414304735845	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.450489236461	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.287034811219	Predominantly African-American and Hispanic.
1.0	0.494643307479	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.48264296906	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.431764723503	There are a lot of things we've got to do in our country, reigning in Wall Street is certainly one of them.
0.0	0.483639541776	And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.351735908827	They were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.290079947923	That's what should be done.
0.0	0.411018814205	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.344342986864	Did a couple of cataract surgeries over Christmas holidays.

0.0	0.403911255708	Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem.
0.0	0.345487035064	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.478653026251	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.478392751554	I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures.
0.0	0.321623805028	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.398081209669	KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.
0.0	0.423488369907	That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities.
0.0	0.519508424752	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.397488068029	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.408847781675	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.5	And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.
0.0	0.364818959926	And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China.
0.0	0.472857690188	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.362575013009	And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.
0.0	0.476214196233	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.
0.0	0.4894308378	Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions?
0.0	0.322066858608	It's making...
0.0	0.371509304	I voted against the war.
0.0	0.392101056042	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.138181376589	I was in Burlington, Iowa.
0.0	0.453199690437	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.335326653593	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.152372265108	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.41994814009	We have to come together as a country.
0.0	0.344403365465	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.376771728996	I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.
0.0	0.515064669164	It's one of 15 strategic goals I've set out to make our country a better place by cutting these sort of deaths in half in the next five years.
0.0	0.286150763551	... funding to them.
0.0	0.229446622381	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.450881113109	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.424574009564	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.423477649192	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.378851659117	I think the issue here is -- and I applaud Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.375649420251	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.479466420913	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.454431587179	In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...
0.0	0.444951976262	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.352698752591	Let's reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.397441714049	Revolution never came.
0.0	0.398175673037	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.491387585001	Or a young woman who had been performing at President Obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member.
0.0	0.446604536109	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.26492277686	Yes.
0.0	0.355773815726	I waited and I got the scars to show for it.
0.0	0.280322367675	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.481498962612	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.5	There is broad consensus, 92 percent in the most recently poll of Americans want gun safety measures...
0.0	0.361783192421	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.452021001778	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
1.0	0.766162101473	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.424970115631	Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...
0.0	0.427043199795	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
1.0	0.74053059167	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.401568920369	None of that information was looked at.
0.0	0.369103218431	I know the good ones.
0.0	0.429225248904	But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.
0.0	0.5	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.238154398436	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.389013676642	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.450259243042	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.480448844541	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.507088546852	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
1.0	0.841384607608	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.
0.0	0.243439192753	The answer is no.
0.0	0.473432174224	ISIS, now, is the major priority.
0.0	0.444988266477	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.358465019692	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.349808387339	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.479324111801	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.475039308478	If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences.
0.0	0.323502502926	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.403047330213	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.
0.0	0.420568929174	We only have one or two.
0.0	0.339426096625	Look, here is the reality, folks.
1.0	0.457433710525	Twenty-one mass shootings, including one last weekend in Des Moins where three were murdered.
0.0	0.394799644502	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.484540748454	It's one of the key investments we need to make.
0.0	0.597929793896	...
0.0	0.476398061763	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.244677467947	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.42660071204	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.460946911041	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.468236130017	I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.
0.0	0.471277155673	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.463407466006	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.470740226555	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.333675552976	But we came together.
0.0	0.45065651667	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.488994369324	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.431440902739	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.347450904056	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.422858006305	Because I've seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime.
0.0	0.392194572487	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.241523686296	Okay, thank you.
0.0	0.2531756939	I really am.
0.0	0.467699301235	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.
0.0	0.46417851315	Well, we're going to have to redo the way the prescription drug industry does business.
0.0	0.380895773582	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.41789432769	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.447485461167	And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
0.0	0.340063447348	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.444595910854	But I said, "Don't hit Iraq," because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East.
0.0	0.485957289962	Wall Street today has too much political power.
0.0	0.436069234042	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.305030101693	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.466568064952	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.
0.0	0.5	I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here.
0.0	0.461425290459	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.509439248748	So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion.
0.0	0.5	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.432571738743	Never support.
0.0	0.462017406137	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.250757585276	It sounds crass.
0.0	0.51585419143	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.429135007436	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.479897620455	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.438408848982	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.41694566393	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.445211655538	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.375832056606	He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, "No interest."
0.0	0.39237325749	I would just say that...
0.0	0.355626298131	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.464406931024	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.372622776952	He is a good man.
0.0	0.307479436682	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.308414555853	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.389616389834	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.523933090862	You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56 percent, equivalent to 56 percent of the GDP In America.
1.0	0.765400376666	Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.
0.0	0.421559813824	You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.
0.0	0.296934014315	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.374641078991	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.316579887936	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.391799346108	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.272527595457	Let's...
0.0	0.407112330762	He said, "You know, I make great product."
0.0	0.5	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
1.0	0.714137277628	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.448587217618	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.44680654475	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.446667593945	So it's unfair to say in total...
0.0	0.431024417188	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.462285563712	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.479059993977	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.419049830511	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.481758767084	I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
0.0	0.458236798326	I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.
0.0	0.307126475164	But we stuck to our message.
1.0	0.492480700878	And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
0.0	0.421680312601	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.507212107427	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.480203968726	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.553828586747	Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.
0.0	0.427916856804	I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.489729242736	It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.
0.0	0.45489911458	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.490342155732	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.389877686078	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.516226124474	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.52034790017	Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force.
0.0	0.449180481118	They have children who are doing so well, I've met and worked with dreamers.
0.0	0.400599136313	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
1.0	0.537012335088	And I have assets -- big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected -- 9 billion 240 million dollars.
0.0	0.374775539484	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.386136456831	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.469227924247	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.484156218572	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.382292408403	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.449015728795	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.
0.0	0.351315284009	People aren't dumb.
1.0	0.492743695229	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.418517946339	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.492067952289	Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability.
0.0	0.275518343761	So you know what?
0.0	0.436022292113	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.530666793037	She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.5	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.276342030895	That's true.
0.0	0.440230903291	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.494579426813	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.43373341071	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.438900987558	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.34003603452	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.515492858828	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.455433894634	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.434022900511	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.5	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.348270672694	They sweated like dogs.
0.0	0.389263859271	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.420785722345	We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be -- we ought to send our surplus.
0.0	0.321294061156	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.489799816206	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.447871241985	As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe.
0.0	0.520883476815	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.308930655705	I like them.
0.0	0.433076120978	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
0.0	0.411542852794	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.397913204021	We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
0.0	0.411339006187	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.417714902602	But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."
0.0	0.40653089276	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.408403705608	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.300915541569	And I opposed it.
0.0	0.458664689466	We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy.
0.0	0.447623255206	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.376311968341	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.330234957553	John, I think somewhere between...
0.0	0.456410204165	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.471577431899	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.494372184401	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.38860974632	It is ISIS.
0.0	0.42381074756	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.486797919556	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
1.0	0.5	And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent.
0.0	0.385918213173	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.247847578571	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.387076711595	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.310099867229	We're running.
0.0	0.444104183593	Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
0.0	0.5	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.466629766856	But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country.
1.0	0.833051837443	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.35514392758	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.363352810423	Folks, it's not too late.
0.0	0.461046730971	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.360324768861	Let me just...
1.0	0.494511831363	We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.464530644585	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.470875741983	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.597929793896	That has not been...
0.0	0.432123547612	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.447480246446	And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details.
0.0	0.406113111119	We were the first in the family.
0.0	0.474294025641	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.
0.0	0.421012047529	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.505482044792	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.479615327885	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.453744181107	In the last 30 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth.
0.0	0.5	My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, which sparked my interest in the need for immigration reform because I know what it's like to be the son of an immigrant.
0.0	0.465828562894	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.5	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.453122400751	And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.
0.0	0.308771229901	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.471938852987	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.512312188974	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.437086063951	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.400103736662	I made it the old-fashioned way.
0.0	0.466077232296	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.506299363926	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.488584811199	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.404284025487	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.493699971469	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.479874575621	Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago.
0.0	0.480328989175	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.298743623212	We can do that.
0.0	0.335309683112	All of you in Iowa, I need you to caucus for me.
0.0	0.508137339474	Paul Volcker, one of the leading lights of trying to reign in the excesses, has also said he does not support reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.491455522271	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.362873117768	That's a wonderful business model.
0.0	0.424138293591	We're rebuilding many countries.
0.0	0.241834180303	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.445349191243	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.456964783536	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.423454090356	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.308930655705	I like that.
0.0	0.435181876557	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.597929793896	...
0.0	0.418906155939	It costs me $3.
0.0	0.413042058768	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
1.0	0.395684110476	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.523159607907	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.388563959343	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.373495368545	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.463926750628	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.269245669143	That's what we believe in.
0.0	0.473158929983	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.384154997781	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.313549893362	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.455250434534	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.257949114693	Looking forward to it.
0.0	0.338785385895	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.385069321099	And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.
0.0	0.471606468001	Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone.
0.0	0.392005493509	You've got to be on top of it.
0.0	0.597929793896	But Megyn...
0.0	0.401741552257	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.283668226147	We have to do something.
0.0	0.392133927179	I was there in '89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.

0.0	0.436282482082	I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart.
0.0	0.17879328618	We did our own rallies.
0.0	0.485582837624	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.368587046125	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.450237620957	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.

0.0	0.453363276642	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
1.0	0.770316498081	It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate.
0.0	0.30565270624	I kind of miss him.
0.0	0.251747342501	And that is what we have done in Ohio.

0.0	0.373339470123	You learn to create feedback mechanisms.
0.0	0.443494860756	We will see what the American people are willing to support.
0.0	0.482381376045	And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.419323453846	I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House.
0.0	0.473280815595	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.420809753236	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.438931320765	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.424237662788	Is there an area for a safety net?

0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.43620828785	Let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.369132985255	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.526187422027	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.40903041071	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.166640190787	But I was born here.
0.0	0.492284646127	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.462875475743	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.321103107512	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.317280482343	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.4358168431	The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
0.0	0.418460473307	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.395743846705	I know how hard it is to build coalitions.
0.0	0.510024801248	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.37018242633	A military island.
0.0	0.464215446658	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.400268865688	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.40321157616	But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand.
0.0	0.422253496161	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.443063104895	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
0.0	0.409636167663	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.362452513043	They wouldn't be there except for us.
0.0	0.480921736262	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.463943792769	But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
0.0	0.484135575597	They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.
0.0	0.40288239704	But he used to say, "Donald, don't go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.299051491177	But the facts are simple.
0.0	0.459367721057	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.408004154645	A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.
0.0	0.232957128211	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.245438059968	That is the issue.
0.0	0.508305413034	Why is it that we are spending per capita far, far more than Canada, which is 100 miles away from my door, that guarantees health care to all people?
0.0	0.429736501228	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.521725576277	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.437578103723	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.314733292645	It is enormously complicated.
0.0	0.428896296495	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.39984173707	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.465149798033	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.597929793896	No, you did.
0.0	0.433988427188	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.300564078004	That is an egregious act.
0.0	0.42334796524	He said, "Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."

0.0	0.475443819883	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.

0.0	0.223187796673	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.360049381626	It really is important that we go forward on this.
0.0	0.366614432201	They can't lead us.

0.0	0.397434305023	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.48252672163	And now many of these candidates want to cut it.
0.0	0.439386375445	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.427882456488	When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
0.0	0.424403476722	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.

0.0	0.246267683925	I think you're --
0.0	0.453774831222	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.478583578541	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.422919789394	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
1.0	0.753183928183	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
0.0	0.380197353357	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.372637907886	And we have to stop all the divisions.
0.0	0.46673257205	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.329166707387	... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.
1.0	0.462224394781	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.45812405853	I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.
0.0	0.422997202092	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.298743623212	You can do both.
0.0	0.5	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.385235182936	They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there.
0.0	0.483985793131	On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center.
0.0	0.476195670622	It means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana.
0.0	0.468190106174	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.445900827548	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.416411327543	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.459896533655	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.389744039987	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.467686370019	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.456152431254	... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record.
1.0	0.477168617811	John -- John, this country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.433125741309	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.492454047941	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
1.0	0.818867802884	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.276342030895	It's true.
0.0	0.423797479888	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.45124856478	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.397380897534	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.464791291672	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.383620616808	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.281200177003	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.452087726652	We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.
0.0	0.459577548705	That's the difference, and that's the kind of leader we need in the White House.
0.0	0.412751091151	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.399580817328	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.346333029357	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.486757060952	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.347434774737	He said, "I can't get it into China.
0.0	0.425245440758	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.362625302704	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.597929793896	What do we do?
0.0	0.41494643206	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.
0.0	0.393431962127	Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.39132835545	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.455684206467	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.269953537916	Oh, yes there is.
0.0	0.376902990154	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.47081704755	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
1.0	0.779171974508	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.478315702178	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.321055915686	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.471769484067	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.375541318228	We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.
0.0	0.494450156037	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.450058384656	And I will go back and say again, AIG was not a big bank.
0.0	0.366599451446	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.365022055767	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.225200095971	Absolutely.
0.0	0.508701369035	We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.
0.0	0.5	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.380945855593	I'm going to support you, and I think that is absolutely appropriate.
0.0	0.453912038463	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.
0.0	0.434416563377	I'm one of the 77 percent.
0.0	0.486963804591	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.448743949961	I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran.
0.0	0.354942642073	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.484771410582	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.36449597361	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
0.0	0.458981196401	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.481660980504	I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.
0.0	0.383471968679	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.368527789779	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.418059543534	We need sound money.
0.0	0.485775691718	But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.
0.0	0.476972736132	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.405822392904	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.424658730797	All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.
1.0	0.753668548553	They were wrong.
0.0	0.5	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.358415110397	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.378468843811	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.518033163333	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.28545164491	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.311319497273	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.479353366877	And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.
0.0	0.370526377829	She never lived to see that.
0.0	0.390884860621	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.493532587455	If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W. Bush made after 9/11 when he basically said after going to a Mosque in Washington, we are not at war with Islam or Muslims.
1.0	0.75115336181	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.403288557422	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.460036315656	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.5	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.432935883279	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.47176327967	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.410307537324	I think that what we're facing with ISIS is especially complicated.
0.0	0.483792990607	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.454489543784	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
0.0	0.511499023687	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.
1.0	0.340775972023	It doesn't exist, folks.

0.0	0.456518061813	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.487929298646	But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
0.0	0.432808070319	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
1.0	0.542394064059	People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.
0.0	0.5	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.182597853776	That's what they're doing.

0.0	0.38129381156	And so do I.
0.0	0.315992960989	You get together.
0.0	0.465510242925	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.518436013298	It was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up.

0.0	0.445353522768	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.484774420206	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.473347298893	I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war.
0.0	0.404410855725	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.

0.0	0.387388834947	We need much more than that.
0.0	0.456217386996	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.313390526753	Go ahead.
0.0	0.296773812744	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.386306184778	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.282352933727	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.525060271408	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.248334271673	Think about it.
0.0	0.5	And in that capacity, I met with just an extraordinary group of people from World War II, from korea, vietnam, all of the wars.
0.0	0.465998711831	People died, and only three people have been fired.
0.0	0.49463211764	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.414297268968	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.467617821767	Here's my promise-- Wall Street representatives will not be in my cabinet.
0.0	0.458124924349	The business model of Wall Street is fraud.
0.0	0.454696650937	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.458396324693	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.398551545113	Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.
0.0	0.464044350268	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.444979036244	Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title.
0.0	0.458558582433	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.
0.0	0.386332560174	How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
0.0	0.485500388185	They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.330399663512	We say "we're gonna protect."
0.0	0.463395674179	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.456653118757	And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.
0.0	0.475201555429	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.452278545554	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.5	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.347779727633	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.293169501656	I gotta do it, Dad.
0.0	0.391096606008	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
0.0	0.462442811157	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.151144900021	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.477301312255	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.372029012887	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.453865781654	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.470315289754	He said, "Yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.356728820759	Now they're going militarily.
0.0	0.291006218524	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.45579250134	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.215339966101	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.5	We shouldn't have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time.
0.0	0.365460366789	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.406400324087	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.
0.0	0.471169774526	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.457370893686	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.

1.0	0.816301958622	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.407710697382	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.340384890035	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.439481126872	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.473798288944	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.285127365606	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.432655559133	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.5	What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria, when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family you'd better get out now.
0.0	0.5	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.382062328037	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.366847093791	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.335075884698	We can't even go there.
0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.434562744244	I want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, which they have not been doing.
0.0	0.455848535252	Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them.

0.0	0.4481691035	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.

0.0	0.487855407032	As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country.
0.0	0.403504615952	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.409580541833	They beat us all the time.
0.0	0.47422873554	We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.
0.0	0.384219071672	And so, you go the extra mile.
0.0	0.37865594238	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.445169487484	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.280933662255	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.447930740088	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.456300426248	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.465599719498	Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.
0.0	0.461249021123	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.41675503614	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.
0.0	0.45065070489	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.191082338758	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.468337987306	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.5	My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.
0.0	0.472046391634	China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.340727901981	My name was invoked.
0.0	0.437244254191	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.460602760257	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.403375718768	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.461779661215	The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
0.0	0.434083821052	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.

0.0	0.474234372233	Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.488049452888	Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization called ISIS.
0.0	0.429834940889	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
0.0	0.416873782365	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.417305175667	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.482490519423	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.38182064435	You know, this is not easy work.
0.0	0.46906120185	I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.
0.0	0.360522166492	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.362421664858	But people have to be alert.
0.0	0.476671011333	That's what I said to my own public health people.
0.0	0.335345990193	We have -- I don't know that there's any disagreement here...
0.0	0.469300226936	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.472869546936	And I'll tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign.
0.0	0.343753725604	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
0.0	0.5	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.481687549909	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.419368675314	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.310470525932	He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
0.0	0.494401914338	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.
0.0	0.416432629666	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.342964675526	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.441256505785	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.48220751901	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
0.0	0.380638245928	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.467432100855	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.446718114759	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.307362924267	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.479057578694	We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.
0.0	0.420438992849	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.5	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.401582707466	So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.
0.0	0.262616423397	So, so important.
0.0	0.431511571148	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.419106130188	Great state, great people.
0.0	0.421955839592	If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say?
0.0	0.444201805448	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.418004784661	I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
0.0	0.47359004981	It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.
0.0	0.45325775013	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.460181402486	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.
0.0	0.465990351173	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.33271832804	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.459655214644	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.468908935746	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.470230145169	I am on the committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.244088688767	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.49175910278	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.456486626721	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.440881815807	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.258934175426	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.248334271673	Think about it.
0.0	0.278519309752	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.359532824366	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.425746385241	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.409675519113	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.597929793896	You did.
0.0	0.345364264953	Well, sure.
0.0	0.350601100503	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.463996761304	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.448026842838	But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
0.0	0.343475843723	They should be Muslim troops.
0.0	0.419158007093	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.444852078742	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.211678139539	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
0.0	0.494565539452	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.437689039427	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.5	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.454196391018	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.5	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.46123552638	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
0.0	0.460860595393	Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country.
0.0	0.485936586683	So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.
0.0	0.401308395769	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.385011441353	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.395441449121	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.277525403646	I would prioritize them.
0.0	0.447869663374	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.446253868823	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.423568004129	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
1.0	0.721171702284	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.484452264149	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
1.0	0.739454264332	In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.
0.0	0.409603568623	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.328750737878	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.436518947243	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.459635755791	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.190001884643	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.147432964743	No, John.
0.0	0.396810212834	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.375001548399	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.491409118885	And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.
0.0	0.396693759435	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.394516813734	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.485622946138	And we have to do more to prevent the flood of foreign fighters that have gone to Syria, especially the ones with western passports, that come back.
0.0	0.508814674776	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.427965832236	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.346180608505	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.47472463371	But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks."
0.0	0.53119248689	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.
0.0	0.463278639265	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.408894522772	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.479203540941	Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?
0.0	0.409118627856	Well, I would just repeat that.
0.0	0.262671919476	It won't happen.
0.0	0.344135868185	Martha, if I may...
0.0	0.401835194183	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.441425474507	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.
0.0	0.380914769747	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.457600477097	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.422790763183	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.451018847347	... people all over this country -- not you, Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other.
0.0	0.349318051278	Now, this is getting to be fun.
0.0	0.479535048711	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.483492885967	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
0.0	0.400839096596	Lehman Brothers was not a big bank.
0.0	0.5	So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating, but the highest median income in America.
1.0	0.761279298339	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.415191405928	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.404668494664	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
1.0	0.425486789283	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.366520946239	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.397335348406	You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America.
0.0	0.360085389312	They wanted Boeing's secrets.
0.0	0.443782355543	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.352986140756	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.
0.0	0.484033588633	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
0.0	0.416220590646	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.415883037666	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.430243728045	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.270034000822	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.434518670176	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.457591606429	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.5	Tear down the EPA's blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates.
0.0	0.433484923524	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.441778791681	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.428615560496	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.434377544506	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.482613188241	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.358653336566	Carly Fiorina.
1.0	0.533153544136	And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions.
0.0	0.351203797372	in particular.
0.0	0.343349525551	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.5	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.364425025799	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.480322820292	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.282802490682	In addition to that...
0.0	0.314316174311	And, we said no.
0.0	0.298743623212	I can.
0.0	0.483645776463	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.278214675243	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.597929793896	Why is it...
0.0	0.34301576189	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.476378280015	And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
0.0	0.262014463041	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.381496843555	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.480952566907	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.391049614804	The nature of warfare has changed.
0.0	0.378525225162	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.391691562324	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.473132652384	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.427936356651	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.453741985894	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.242365425783	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.483521540097	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.357204218309	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.523575039531	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.470995775044	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.298743623212	And we can do it.
0.0	0.458433714447	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.26492277686	Yes.
0.0	0.103547031101	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.447260846689	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
1.0	0.916558169267	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.336415719764	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.381986580237	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.287715915868	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.435835969151	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.377539296071	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.305531659493	Good at email.
0.0	0.430422133107	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
0.0	0.386603476898	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.5	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.469762465319	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.370065100388	That's not the role of the government.
1.0	0.798886017723	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.5	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.258527272451	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.474220211742	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.483371600072	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.468053389753	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.258918090437	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.5	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.310713157664	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.449154547817	... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.4924199707	There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America.
0.0	0.464218065502	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
0.0	0.287097363081	I don't care.
0.0	0.360501999145	These are very, very real issues.
0.0	0.456696404498	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.331271614604	Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.
0.0	0.509099813016	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.377831281047	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.390383039304	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.476909396753	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.435241497343	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.387037380924	Martha, may I -- Martha, may I...
0.0	0.377548255003	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.40076804858	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.388875012763	Well, I've got news for you, we can.
0.0	0.38987015703	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.509283539046	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.450219817901	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.438531814242	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.477431261298	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.456633617455	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.425259578244	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.46362998524	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.346510774596	But it's a lot safer.

1.0	0.765672843449	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.467415629449	Well, David, I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country.
0.0	0.476775996408	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.328288182084	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.5	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.
0.0	0.457923344907	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
0.0	0.414430461045	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.439147902133	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.422270687434	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.513607723263	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.43908856498	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.438044422762	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.493153321182	hospital that needs to be improved and made better for them turned over to privatization.
0.0	0.468209052931	Maybe now we can get it moving again so that we can upgrade it so that it does include all the tools and everything in our arsenal that we can use to try to work with our allies and our friends, come up with better intelligence.
0.0	0.430199732465	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.369269225996	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.456339523214	I think that is the number one requirement.
1.0	0.449319543202	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.468333661363	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.36135121976	And you have to really work hard at it.
0.0	0.241723597824	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.267767596525	I like China.
0.0	0.44822409044	It has too much economic power.
0.0	0.484453146971	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.467403471483	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.439972935929	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.208142995736	For her convenience.

0.0	0.384558127608	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.5	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.481932136248	And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.
0.0	0.475225959584	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.494090067006	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.479329466731	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.
0.0	0.443226314345	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.

0.0	0.430148958339	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.43993497259	It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably -- probably -- from the Middle East.
0.0	0.30398164263	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.392456690503	Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."
0.0	0.45096162255	There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
0.0	0.597929793896	What are we doing?
0.0	0.236206961877	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.371188805302	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.386348422466	People say, "Oh, you don't like China?"
0.0	0.508610247951	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
1.0	0.472237647296	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.328626424826	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.494312892722	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.423234039661	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.430415536948	He thinks low wages are a good idea.
0.0	0.447260376932	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.35577426558	Let me respond...
0.0	0.460770098283	But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.
0.0	0.383309878349	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.472151519111	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.351254037275	And second of all...
0.0	0.492195911093	I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country.
0.0	0.443995018049	Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
0.0	0.41505492081	I do and this is an important issue and I know we'll get to a lot of other critical ones as well.
0.0	0.339210150201	I made it when I ran in 2008.
0.0	0.51575364848	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.439157676631	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.466072303603	In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill, "Well I assume Hillary has told you about this."
0.0	0.477039570565	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.481413228527	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.380758501139	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
0.0	0.172188732553	They can't.
0.0	0.355931038591	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.408428175236	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...
0.0	0.288822825346	Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.
0.0	0.478860157465	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.
0.0	0.375787441512	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.404880419795	And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?
0.0	0.5	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.421765379237	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.368410844519	That can be done.
0.0	0.597929793896	It's not.
0.0	0.411574345663	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.484278319903	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.407433921007	When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.
0.0	0.274283868456	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.261178727759	I have to tell you.
0.0	0.5	Seventeen more million more people have health care.
0.0	0.478569002605	$1 billion a day.
0.0	0.489647916168	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.336794053311	I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
0.0	0.455556726658	I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place.
0.0	0.253082519493	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.406160343689	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.430408947171	The central question in this race is trust.
0.0	0.364560044666	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.460544140191	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.319318445007	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.333838164894	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.48060855191	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.458515294234	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.469228319107	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.37885746842	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.407881052255	We have artificially low interest rates.
0.0	0.412293701098	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.418466125109	If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen.
0.0	0.518298222408	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.419614833634	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
0.0	0.389692650158	All right, Nancy, I really wish you'd come back to me on this on this one, John...
0.0	0.492201177566	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.438377474588	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.35499686392	Now, here's what is going to happen.
0.0	0.436492025248	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.509074319496	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.26492277686	Yes.
0.0	0.468849854576	And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.389471452849	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.430113092315	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.448158438858	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.29352976919	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.467030327041	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.291956155514	All right.
0.0	0.358685978081	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.489344362934	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.487648607263	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.378048659923	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.418189773293	We have to stop the money flow.
1.0	0.843440447489	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
0.0	0.383232427314	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.467749517874	You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.
0.0	0.458858445055	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.216911900666	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.334353715238	Our president doesn't have a clue.
0.0	0.467242443106	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.5	We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.
0.0	0.42491197526	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.487851546111	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.384854501768	We got nothing but problems.
0.0	0.507493162715	Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally.
0.0	0.439129039216	Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
0.0	0.228796684781	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.437705172894	You learn to create a security cabinet.
0.0	0.426143317257	You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.
0.0	0.417127983974	It's time for real substance and real experience.
1.0	0.43951864816	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.21441322103	They knew that.
0.0	0.467627431478	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.483183046288	The United States has, unfortunately, been victimized by terrorism going back decades.
0.0	0.389240514038	Because we need money.
0.0	0.186794730824	Neil?
1.0	0.782842633613	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.443279055528	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.377814986749	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.443396340961	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.316640230838	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.421674896355	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.457332501547	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.437897497739	And here's the problem in this country right now.
1.0	0.366506411264	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.451419810864	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.
0.0	0.448590346899	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.484452781178	Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come...
0.0	0.478991876804	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.483897096891	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.289444537148	I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail.
0.0	0.168142780377	Those are your enemies.
0.0	0.454050282484	We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force.
0.0	0.361813332582	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.35916812962	Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.
0.0	0.514778545442	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
1.0	0.421113670396	And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph).
0.0	0.389585220206	Our vets may see the V.A.
0.0	0.5	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.473095920241	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.430304233199	He's the one that did Bergdahl.
0.0	0.470671614885	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.395151466112	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.474140364748	The United States must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.456315663802	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.5	The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.
0.0	0.198536932861	Wow.
0.0	0.428775803786	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.42968631094	So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly.
0.0	0.426340201779	The number of women --
0.0	0.409367251133	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.348352783834	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.433916258523	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.438667364955	It's very important we operate on both at the same time.
0.0	0.388317745375	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.450829168162	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.413415598916	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.506129886751	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.389990075589	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.
0.0	0.5	I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.
0.0	0.350959601612	I can promise you.
0.0	0.38697645237	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.30074338256	You're simply not.
0.0	0.447395627432	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.487182188347	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.293028049334	Washington is broken.
0.0	0.418120666351	But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting.

0.0	0.417611765084	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.487961482021	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.425464054257	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.455489172155	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.385179077168	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.507264613449	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
1.0	0.783013329141	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.355967327844	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.
0.0	0.362707167457	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.439731692876	They're going to take away thousands of jobs.
0.0	0.48213979603	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.406653541459	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.454310930557	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.471054539382	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.465813333408	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.490903711479	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.39383179675	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.

0.0	0.377872616714	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.451527539832	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.3731549518	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.463311998042	We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.
0.0	0.463606332205	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.406220283944	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.

0.0	0.397997241502	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
0.0	0.492286758746	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.459185895966	I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.
0.0	0.452379514396	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.425498151926	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.597929793896	And why?

0.0	0.232096379972	They're off to China.
0.0	0.26492277686	Yes.
0.0	0.344160117557	It never happens.
0.0	0.298121092711	This is absolutely absurd.
0.0	0.408195037732	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.42261754419	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.383624807584	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.433463646901	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.469793767309	Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.

0.0	0.384274985632	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
0.0	0.416665630667	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.403291578921	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...
0.0	0.374738380801	And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.
0.0	0.439915083904	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.467823872426	This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.
0.0	0.422154734646	As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that.
0.0	0.413852528944	And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
0.0	0.309526413249	That is exactly...
0.0	0.356640166741	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.244538737148	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.291956155514	Right.
0.0	0.481305199524	So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.
0.0	0.475475812125	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.356448432187	They're terrified by the saber rattling.
0.0	0.413798104995	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.362094558413	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.481475816604	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.47407595995	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.406378758759	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.349250120617	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.420386894534	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.416532401435	So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
0.0	0.405427818441	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.407884236437	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.287258942632	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.385476893241	John, I would disagree with Secretary Clinton respectfully on this score.
0.0	0.489126426063	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.348187523171	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.336096440028	This is a complicated issue.
0.0	0.5	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.433463821109	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.432709687195	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.372667296956	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.3615255518	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.424310834091	I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.
0.0	0.458888559857	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
0.0	0.280322367675	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.429250938037	We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq.
0.0	0.454553383406	We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.
0.0	0.476204632367	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.5	But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.
0.0	0.373749317605	We need a collaborative approach.
0.0	0.45727395965	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.480992661921	Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor.
0.0	0.426532322005	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.456831739015	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.454965668125	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.5	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.406383098751	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.424226807741	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.
0.0	0.405074631797	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.5	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.530119712435	Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.
0.0	0.202271480595	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.49075453002	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
1.0	0.834206108424	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
0.0	0.475138031973	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.334084961473	I've done it.
0.0	0.358960663677	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.248087319513	Here's what I'd do.
0.0	0.293123789983	Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country.
0.0	0.526475441565	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.424977732233	But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue -- requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.400691624925	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
0.0	0.428973013041	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.464108290917	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
1.0	0.402011861225	It's never below zero.
0.0	0.40285854982	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.493939850185	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
0.0	0.380790994818	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...
0.0	0.196955107251	No vision at all.
0.0	0.489659773278	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.

0.0	0.377517721356	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.435460939573	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.408294460406	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.328477090304	Doctors are quitting.
0.0	0.448429358522	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.429839371281	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.397506839123	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.225200095971	Absolutely.
0.0	0.5	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.286962399277	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.46422720664	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.386795436094	I just want a job.

0.0	0.220106416542	He's a progressive economist.
0.0	0.487146964705	I guess the one I -- I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after Bin Laden.
0.0	0.428864915867	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.487631161778	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.244899680985	He does great.
0.0	0.42730109289	Because a lot of people said, "He'll never run.
0.0	0.313052345486	It is not tough talk.
0.0	0.389327764906	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.358358830771	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.376056080019	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.435004529677	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.402755704178	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.489726372989	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.459704018624	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.337916792213	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.445312393639	Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
0.0	0.411592379671	But wait, I just want to say this Senator.
0.0	0.291956155514	She was right.
0.0	0.537106810467	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.343121755648	Let me say this.
0.0	0.374994054127	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.361002399409	I want this bill to be voted down.
0.0	0.506875895772	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.470048381752	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.438915397294	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.384679565643	$24 trillion.
0.0	0.478068018143	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
0.0	0.386899435834	They are not doing it now.
0.0	0.314316174311	That's what I said.
0.0	0.253742870303	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.475523765048	The endorsements that I'm proud of are conservative leaders like Dr. James Dobson, and over 700,000 contributions nationwide, people going to our Web site, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.166080647245	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.416881351546	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.350842876367	They don't know how to bring it about.
0.0	0.511956230897	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.386468567493	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.395419107254	He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots.
0.0	0.417698609941	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.332678987014	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.456993294969	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.411871118997	People were shocked, Trump got it.
0.0	0.484848309795	And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.
0.0	0.476408021093	And if our middle class makes more money, they spend more money, and our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.477565160913	We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
0.0	0.328100219125	Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted.
0.0	0.364927525406	We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
1.0	0.784991065229	And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.
0.0	0.339228255714	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.468832984489	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.440623660768	As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election.
0.0	0.402875568694	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.407683085581	Well, this whole issue concerns me.
0.0	0.47544196967	Secretary Clinton also said we -- it was not just the invasion of Iraq which Secretary Clinton voted for and has since said was a big mistake -- and, indeed, it was.
0.0	0.312965828856	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.276342030895	That's not true.
0.0	0.397468720732	But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college.
0.0	0.438226998205	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.385102411807	And I do not believe it's a good idea now.
0.0	0.430168044625	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.295550194799	Afghanistan is a mess.
0.0	0.350690296498	Of course, you would.
0.0	0.225200095971	Absolutely.

0.0	0.454692129546	They're building up their military to a point that is very scary.
0.0	0.310016153749	I totally get that.
0.0	0.340311421433	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.5309382834	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.413032104899	His first election and his re-election.

0.0	0.46821202925	What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy, and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need.
0.0	0.329824142094	I am glad Donald is running.
0.0	0.444678674745	I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.
0.0	0.182597853776	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.400548816221	And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016.
0.0	0.394277955379	I don't think a halt is necessary.
0.0	0.42820512947	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.

0.0	0.350534594642	We've gotten off the Hillary's e-mails, good.
0.0	0.268370309806	I am advocating...
0.0	0.432264037714	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.403218828598	And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?
0.0	0.492271797682	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.432204472983	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.
0.0	0.365774982892	I would not want to go to that point.
0.0	0.5	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.393401231947	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.448804145297	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.

0.0	0.487864024641	If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.
0.0	0.49482984938	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.475349101514	When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it.
0.0	0.363741139029	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.512600340025	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.392555917835	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.421407682688	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
0.0	0.443168618812	But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.

0.0	0.459338654903	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.597929793896	...

0.0	0.461571443775	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.

0.0	0.597929793896	No.
0.0	0.427315526358	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.597929793896	That's it.
0.0	0.474029843898	First priority, destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.362157242654	They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists.
0.0	0.297218899136	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
1.0	0.305061076925	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.34580133952	... Chris, keep it coming...
0.0	0.445787558015	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.357626901885	I changed it in New Jersey.

0.0	0.423817310459	Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.
0.0	0.280406221485	You're right.
0.0	0.407567564567	Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy.
0.0	0.492534019	I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.
0.0	0.454611094611	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.449012695557	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
0.0	0.379036789109	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.375208031837	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.452063488181	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.490310345823	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.435391764125	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.40520414453	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.465873408395	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.408674929094	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.445731833849	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.295899384912	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.272904201316	I'm running.
0.0	0.282171428762	We have nothing.
0.0	0.361123887892	I don't think we're at war with all Muslims.
0.0	0.452030092356	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
0.0	0.388789175346	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.390681510467	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.382978689887	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.427509451133	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.471619930268	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.481242217477	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.376466632783	I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.
0.0	0.405536028743	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.5	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.421872347352	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.466660515331	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.396493973491	Just get me a job.
0.0	0.442606158541	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
1.0	0.805961612424	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.388375142903	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.439597453345	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.380552832508	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.5	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
1.0	0.45870641078	We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks a piece.
0.0	0.431655725662	And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.
0.0	0.444489514196	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.154543379484	Whoa.
0.0	0.467732621223	And I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well.
0.0	0.430716779694	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.342964675526	We're up 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.303351873584	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.466922396088	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.228683385371	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.451110742536	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.251151054139	We got it.
0.0	0.400198381443	And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe.
0.0	0.318449403594	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.383027425376	And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't."
0.0	0.254959649824	I introduced...
0.0	0.207487114135	OK...
0.0	0.440026366227	Close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole and...
0.0	0.489078845596	I spent a lot of time in the situation room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us.
0.0	0.440749236048	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.386422655699	We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.
0.0	0.393838312505	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.597929793896	It is.
0.0	0.5	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.439848675716	Support community banks and credit unions.
0.0	0.247144170887	And there's a lot.
0.0	0.416985399999	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.291956155514	That's right.
0.0	0.34957675479	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.265306406074	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.409608528707	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.493830026161	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.5	And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.
0.0	0.392332197095	I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.
0.0	0.192534283563	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.275518343761	We know about the Belgians.
0.0	0.403386298616	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.509253655422	It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.
0.0	0.472377065473	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.476176942532	So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
0.0	0.486620650899	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.291956155514	Right.
1.0	0.488987958565	I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded.
0.0	0.316865488544	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.373024777854	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.482813733592	First of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy, as you've indicated.
0.0	0.449274752325	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.355506591099	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.395636945306	That's the wrong number.
0.0	0.402283293723	Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire.
0.0	0.472034559734	And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country.
0.0	0.437917757589	We must able to work collaboratively with others.
0.0	0.389440653359	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.428660543511	You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future.
0.0	0.381694854101	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.473103804713	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.404203547464	I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.
0.0	0.510206748507	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.484745057022	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.424359807275	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.418836286815	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.280406221485	You're right.
0.0	0.441252100891	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
0.0	0.475109524099	It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.
0.0	0.421902353516	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.5	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.363810625254	Whoever heard of this?
0.0	0.410685489633	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
1.0	0.756711080444	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
0.0	0.256492877649	That's calling it what it is.
0.0	0.506659977632	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.282557945591	Yes, I apologize.
0.0	0.260229930952	Go to YouTube.
0.0	0.289105398478	That's when we become Greece.
0.0	0.404252999159	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.365032505479	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.440936466897	Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.
0.0	0.427522081703	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.437045008138	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.231462448426	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.425474223323	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.368192192938	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.3959546872	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.17770332614	He's very charming.
0.0	0.380305679801	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.462271789301	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.479431440843	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.339225861812	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.291956155514	That's not right.
0.0	0.397842814539	And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent.
0.0	0.315582842226	You're certainly not very good.
0.0	0.269245669143	Here's what I believe.
0.0	0.597929793896	No.
0.0	0.383759447239	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.443887215293	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.476464794238	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.356929606731	They kill us.
0.0	0.474359337452	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.323524897691	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.437382058858	You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.314315554797	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.37978773109	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.509437015484	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.277435313526	Sure did.
0.0	0.597929793896	What do we do?
0.0	0.41853733269	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.431024417188	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.417768067304	Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly.
0.0	0.359366116599	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.360317226043	And I think has had a big impact.
0.0	0.480604547231	I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.
0.0	0.29481190796	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.485237014115	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.483157794895	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.52387704539	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
0.0	0.456057077309	We need to end minimal sentencing.
0.0	0.305241857881	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.422755277003	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.186794730824	Neil...
0.0	0.381848308877	That would be a disaster for this country.
0.0	0.410027329759	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.368872154579	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.37756004818	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.4706746025	We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.
0.0	0.514542263167	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.48360316435	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.44851126005	But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said.
0.0	0.421741578941	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.429914328906	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.408988250729	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.328667763702	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.438853615312	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.45182662023	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.597929793896	And...
0.0	0.360447058277	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.398686725072	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.26492277686	Yes.
0.0	0.455598990179	And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
0.0	0.312001731117	You know, the situation is this.
0.0	0.414824514139	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.492931960766	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.408526814144	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.341583440481	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.265248270615	How has it worked?
0.0	0.347967230879	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.27479371698	But they're not good.
0.0	0.456262190231	And that this world, with American leadership, can and must come together to destroy them.
0.0	0.409006717779	People who we should be welcoming and working with.
0.0	0.448518338329	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.436787638297	They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.
0.0	0.443494942822	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.442970376966	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.422570844741	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.47902078012	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.420398907762	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.351315284009	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.378538042548	You want one?
0.0	0.366073554919	May I respond to the critique on the ...
0.0	0.358200330312	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.385311166762	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.336857087729	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.494456644248	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.440231332163	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.47750277849	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.366780650006	That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.
0.0	0.369728160661	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.280879583205	That's the big leagues.
0.0	0.468634201643	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.508873381431	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.397503359832	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.350690296498	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.415488179516	And we need the right people.
0.0	0.266138172923	I am the son and grandson of immigrants.
0.0	0.446718106347	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.394591039817	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.48954012711	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.431001266412	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.419501814332	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.377998671242	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.
0.0	0.380598873764	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.5	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.165450621388	What would we do if this were ebola?
0.0	0.367428674995	Look, the secretary is right.
0.0	0.424634108788	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.515194453558	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.269245669143	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.452219559102	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...
1.0	0.469103248698	We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.
0.0	0.404218185633	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
0.0	0.307100539887	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.402777910545	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.424516069558	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.401981843623	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.436306598268	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.431098041547	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.316103397651	I agree completely.
0.0	0.424470122779	We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
0.0	0.401432841588	Meanwhile, the rich get richer.
0.0	0.456600900728	Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity.
0.0	0.396386128918	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.44420819002	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.334084961473	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.460900204142	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.452741871187	The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.
0.0	0.444992777428	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.388652706722	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.455520330266	We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it.
0.0	0.272745522639	I happen to think...
0.0	0.5	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.5	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.436084923653	But I agree, as I mentioned a moment ago, with King Abdullah.
0.0	0.386168588865	And we also need a cheerleader.
0.0	0.459337103884	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.228648851558	She voted for it.
0.0	0.203206462888	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.421496015168	The simple fact is, we all have a record.
0.0	0.449282602541	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.201998780751	Alright.
0.0	0.38464035171	She led that effort.
0.0	0.462867427897	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.467277710031	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.426862148521	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.444204687848	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
1.0	0.349224138342	He's not wall street.
0.0	0.597929793896	Have to do it.
0.0	0.45036762514	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.457994648983	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.375664764647	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.435407689351	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.466744493454	Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face.
1.0	0.513507871168	$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work.
0.0	0.416314216289	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.420135076399	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.431631177826	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.396849524673	To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.
1.0	0.750539851729	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
0.0	0.434361944573	But at the end of the day, no doubt, the Affordable Care Act is a step forward.
0.0	0.486114300994	There's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.
0.0	0.293573962637	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.461792178497	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.410215640164	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.597929793896	...
0.0	0.333361078396	Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.
0.0	0.397556746745	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.374794543446	There are a lot of factors involved in that.
0.0	0.407123902461	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.510086656175	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.430304233199	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.296740495975	Yes, I'm getting...
1.0	0.288766974315	Don't believe the 5.6.
0.0	0.266435456677	You really can't.
0.0	0.358200330312	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.597929793896	It was against Assad.
0.0	0.481520020249	We need, basically, to pledge that we're going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.
0.0	0.373857383532	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.467887620911	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.432321293476	You can't do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they're as threatened as we are.
0.0	0.489080388496	So, in terms of refugees, I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe, with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that, of course, we reach out.
0.0	0.465951167281	Why do -- why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major -- the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?
0.0	0.469880983594	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.445729395726	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.461118256442	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.425579195989	Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.
0.0	0.479074220064	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.
0.0	0.456856376195	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.5	We will -- when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice.
1.0	0.457699561787	2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.
0.0	0.434561375346	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.5	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.372064858681	ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.
0.0	0.407660253422	That's the right of people.
0.0	0.5	I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war.
0.0	0.383993017348	What is the best way to do it?
0.0	0.412458575207	I gotta build those big buildings.
0.0	0.298764860821	Again, Americans murdered.
0.0	0.355323315177	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.407525649056	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
0.0	0.352383009167	Good evening.
0.0	0.434575139206	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.519533026539	When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.
0.0	0.43128471602	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.475108491431	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.5	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.318397699368	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.450153646872	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.334367887476	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.411387590202	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.378515893983	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.44308774302	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.427384131646	They get them on the black market.
1.0	0.796396760699	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.45424253521	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.
0.0	0.414524816394	But I think it's the right road for us to try to travel.
0.0	0.452286596657	And for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.
0.0	0.468405974234	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.597929793896	No their not.
0.0	0.377853017166	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.418631151999	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.406848177557	In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
0.0	0.467633725819	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.394711727461	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.403957929601	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.535550679255	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.44324085463	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.377691297609	So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do.
0.0	0.269657128264	I will...
0.0	0.487905100377	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.269149078637	It's not about Donald Trump.
0.0	0.462147099874	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.352681759931	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.275518343761	But you know what?
0.0	0.413981945012	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.391889995979	We used to have victories, but we don't have them.
0.0	0.449009631147	They should have made it more open ended for the next president.
0.0	0.476834034098	It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military.
0.0	0.448638819869	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.

0.0	0.469357133207	Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.
0.0	0.597929793896	No.
0.0	0.5	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy.
0.0	0.427200217741	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.481835705947	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.460906019519	I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.
0.0	0.29479031654	That was a terrible mistake.
0.0	0.507976063809	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.38062924937	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.2440676794	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.460837234452	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.40606427868	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.5	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.291956155514	All right.
0.0	0.292019360977	Ninety-three hours.
0.0	0.5	You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
1.0	0.748308599275	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.429252354936	I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.
0.0	0.424342182338	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.437540744757	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.336539300609	They are ripping us.

0.0	0.47425390126	When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it.
0.0	0.429321764044	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.597929793896	No, no.
1.0	0.482382341445	And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
0.0	0.424919351263	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.418760999215	This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.
0.0	0.239228387011	He's not a leader.
0.0	0.5	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.44586771477	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.346726368999	That I can tell you.
0.0	0.40976711662	So there's more to my plan than just the cap.
0.0	0.271291200916	Not good.
0.0	0.433501094465	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.

0.0	0.524858139176	Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.
0.0	0.403637192514	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.5	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.391236681033	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.388092487465	There must be some way.
0.0	0.208142995736	She did it for convenience.
0.0	0.5	We brought together legislation supported by the American Legion, the VFW, the DOD, Vietnam Vets, all of the veterans organizations, which was comprehensive.
0.0	0.421876955969	Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months.
0.0	0.427437150418	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.45881337561	Good company.... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in -- and I wouldn't even use -- you know, I have -- I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
0.0	0.437608522333	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.442552649419	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.391633198186	Our vets have been abandoned.
0.0	0.473180230728	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.383664342557	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
0.0	0.462704929542	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.406198071101	I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.
1.0	0.786233066281	When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.

0.0	0.446597340295	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.470082244847	What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger.
0.0	0.39892864568	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.426269794594	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.359253869555	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.447181788934	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.366612456167	And we do have to form a coalition.
0.0	0.430280788423	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.5	And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years.
0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.382521362886	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.45525577535	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.425067069377	This entire question was an attack, but that's (inaudible)
0.0	0.535335157317	And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.
0.0	0.331899743924	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.351073991459	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.5	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.475651563987	If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration.
0.0	0.459698965662	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.313839227714	I think they'd want to hear it.
0.0	0.391900483094	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.340808237962	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.435743361266	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.485117667333	You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.

0.0	0.344241425872	Kathie, this was not merely theory in Maryland.
0.0	0.294083015665	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.494265456807	The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.467795454359	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.47509619372	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.386652097851	That's a hard road to walk.
0.0	0.404960955465	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
1.0	0.78583832364	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.41511555656	The biggest bank in the world is from China.
0.0	0.342350316665	She wants to pursue the American dream.
0.0	0.478894329241	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.343804200527	He wants to change America.
1.0	0.735187907937	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.5	And the U.S. chamber of commerce, which hardly ever says nice things about Democratic governors anywhere, named our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship.
0.0	0.483425735584	The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.

0.0	0.428394125809	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.426662533709	It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
0.0	0.353147721452	We saw what happened in Egypt.
0.0	0.443426114146	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.432417775236	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.308771229901	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.395793591463	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.425431960144	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.308855447961	That makes no sense at all.

0.0	0.448754912122	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.314315554797	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.352355849651	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.388895065082	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.486771879054	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.401517347412	They elected moderate leaders.
0.0	0.322489125026	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.424701327469	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.331426297535	He's not arming the Kurds.
0.0	0.305862195204	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.38358150856	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.446108224486	But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
0.0	0.335673149784	But you know what else they're anxious about?
1.0	0.444280611402	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.345938080546	I have a problem with that, Martha.
0.0	0.392164733196	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.376400743641	He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims -- all Shia Muslims on the planet.
0.0	0.486631369607	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.436398058912	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.476374914972	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
0.0	0.454255330257	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.273595179872	That's who I'm indebted to.
0.0	0.422027819096	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.330172465158	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.5	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.49493038873	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.478538467536	They're not supporting our law enforcement officers, it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.423501473517	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.447290396751	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
1.0	0.304529173976	It was below zero.
0.0	0.442184351838	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.486702298856	ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries.
0.0	0.448976857569	Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer.
0.0	0.477663560623	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.426613451018	This country is changing.
0.0	0.35011999182	I was not the secretary of state...
0.0	0.421376197947	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.287413676572	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.436556508154	Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process.
0.0	0.394366439576	We have tremendous people.
0.0	0.47728235593	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.464331527473	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.245919339496	They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
0.0	0.457339824746	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.467069895402	Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
0.0	0.465947666319	And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues.
0.0	0.516818606355	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.404255661524	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.355354428567	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.437054368933	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.334834861674	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.300758928032	But not for us.
0.0	0.5	I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.
0.0	0.446805317262	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.32751797663	I think it's a two-pronged issue.
0.0	0.461488483357	In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston.
0.0	0.401787712984	Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
0.0	0.384960783643	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.48368160901	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.339297199342	I think I am a nice person.
0.0	0.465390669643	Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform.
0.0	0.436207089045	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.472993164361	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.5	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.
0.0	0.392869704296	And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.
0.0	0.480772825782	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.478105700769	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.408841809378	When you come back to me, I'll share that story.
0.0	0.472244393938	We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.
0.0	0.487575105357	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.402408218076	We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.
0.0	0.380886032771	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.443885997282	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.396380351386	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.434886184713	I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization.
0.0	0.291956155514	All right.
0.0	0.379541666319	He's the greatest show on earth.
0.0	0.475989217382	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.417045897191	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
1.0	0.528506066537	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.374343679922	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.447312617001	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.510570197953	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.338306754016	But Secretary Clinton is wrong.
0.0	0.49003922862	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.309596704804	But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up.
0.0	0.331677800951	So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.
0.0	0.46058357196	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.48631721394	That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive.
0.0	0.460042665037	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.

0.0	0.322357421703	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.328346917881	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?

0.0	0.172783134036	Sorry.
0.0	0.387984180315	I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom.

0.0	0.356044627796	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
0.0	0.215339966101	But look...
0.0	0.380537598709	I said, "I gotta go into Manhattan.

0.0	0.478929199976	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
0.0	0.43584612612	We need to do it now as a nation.

0.0	0.394577403367	So I said, "That's OK." I'm proud of my net worth.
0.0	0.46248370556	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.439149800792	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.418142764901	But, bottom line is this is the year 2015.
0.0	0.356346239347	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.

0.0	0.5	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.492598393541	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.
0.0	0.489099485844	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.4866492718	And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion, this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us, and that we stand with them as they have stood with us.
0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.41157269121	He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long.
0.0	0.425675854449	But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says.
1.0	0.84516877303	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.429897244068	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.470072984918	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.469127549231	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.393305796439	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.42468024352	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.

0.0	0.486129467772	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.475513744964	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.459589054602	We saw a Muslim brotherhood president installed, and then we saw him ousted and the army back.

0.0	0.43556423616	It's a divided country on guns.
0.0	0.418324446504	Now, what the magic number is, I don't know, because we don't know the extent of the problem.
0.0	0.423506805763	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.515949667525	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.447070543754	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.402764282228	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.

0.0	0.433693079798	We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.
0.0	0.396563859686	I don't think anyone has a magical solution.
1.0	0.523666298903	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.448884655077	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.321904524758	He'll say.
0.0	0.460446827594	The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.
0.0	0.510801036589	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.373792418047	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.311165744837	I think he is right.
0.0	0.261346070674	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.449944003402	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.47994376863	But, of course, international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today.
0.0	0.476589161419	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.413535611702	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.454985962979	I released 34 years of tax returns...

0.0	0.444068364775	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
0.0	0.505012659483	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.474958268174	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.

0.0	0.320979534438	I was there and I saw the debate.
0.0	0.441993818004	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.472521529195	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.597929793896	I was not at all.
0.0	0.370685742038	And, I will tell you, I love my life.

0.0	0.460707406379	Major crisis and primary health care.
0.0	0.509325637346	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.

0.0	0.419492459812	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.217556065566	I have no idea.
0.0	0.381348659872	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.469170727435	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.522351625777	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.458517761616	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.445720693311	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.5	At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically.
0.0	0.436542674995	And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.314315554797	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.418124824297	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.319187843899	We will be there soon.
0.0	0.43419588535	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.448766831919	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.437374997522	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.41454134693	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.386426111336	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.353200631755	It's Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.
0.0	0.431950218873	But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.
0.0	0.505810839856	It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act.
0.0	0.5097838339	But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America.
0.0	0.398827156975	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.

0.0	0.348850165424	Nothing's gonna get done.
0.0	0.408638353452	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.460146207857	And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.
0.0	0.492463865949	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.
1.0	0.46044876653	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.

0.0	0.337728178703	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.418353055492	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.380031209621	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
1.0	0.394561204791	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.262253513979	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.474182786041	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.

0.0	0.492729068511	They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.
0.0	0.445601316529	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.417147082262	I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.
0.0	0.419783234731	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.440833260572	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
1.0	0.462734752603	You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small.
1.0	0.473665450256	Well, John, look, I think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis to leave by 2011, is that an Iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend Iraq.
0.0	0.242315872778	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.413140138502	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
0.0	0.438817628908	And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that.
0.0	0.493110897052	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.391360603239	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.521125262907	I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.
0.0	0.518832531435	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.424679038841	And I have to tell you, I would not want -- if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my health care.
0.0	0.344523750621	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.458452288436	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.381102943001	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.472427276719	I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.
0.0	0.433763596502	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.448694315118	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.453531760652	But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.
0.0	0.483867057621	Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage.
0.0	0.5	And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.
0.0	0.413016777767	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.359686107856	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.416970599829	Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough.
0.0	0.489392316636	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.240049963415	That's fine.
0.0	0.445431171402	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.371285320875	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.455183933535	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.402275803315	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.275518343761	And you know what?
0.0	0.421590374641	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.291956155514	All right.
0.0	0.4272561488	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.448765266502	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.392691738631	They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).
0.0	0.450227776509	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.44868834923	But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that.
0.0	0.365489836249	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
0.0	0.5	Well, I'm kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time.
0.0	0.394721654384	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.484365827391	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.449684267504	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.450482546538	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.469358790176	They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea.
0.0	0.393846319152	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.262593693313	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.485327733189	... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.
0.0	0.477038375829	And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears.
0.0	0.434079078785	They can provide forces.
0.0	0.46835642688	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.438847744612	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.381517028065	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.494065134367	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.327428008067	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.409397242065	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
1.0	0.741707119895	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
0.0	0.449652738192	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.351097682499	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.455050676587	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.446526594423	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.
0.0	0.336072205931	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.428640830596	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.355738225147	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.228683385371	It is a disaster.
0.0	0.257871789221	I'm getting to that.
0.0	0.481373169913	And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.520423576216	We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital.
0.0	0.4027767356	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.51276757258	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.358323907029	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.513212840819	But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.
0.0	0.485710861362	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.474467277951	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	0.276342030895	That's not true.
0.0	0.5	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.395877910843	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.467323166935	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.414830742024	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.5	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.476847630535	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.46145909345	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.209528001878	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.444414862015	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.482035852313	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.514020556885	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.441252422454	And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.
0.0	0.419377260125	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.265248270615	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.439252769788	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.384929775295	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.408297207279	Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, "Sorry, fellas.
0.0	0.443282282815	I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
0.0	0.5	It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.
0.0	0.379749565813	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.375826505161	Enough said.
0.0	0.4404932269	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
0.0	0.597929793896	It was.
0.0	0.379258128982	First of all...
0.0	0.294050095819	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.403302811976	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.45767508403	As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.
0.0	0.463278639265	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.407675448403	They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.
0.0	0.430883040813	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.329037131473	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.357422869841	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.39047270837	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.423759995955	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.466757565201	And, of course, I met the mothers of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, and Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and so many of them who have lost their children.
0.0	0.315756667094	It can happen.
0.0	0.450092384357	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.479127678804	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.445900494829	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
0.0	0.468825831649	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
0.0	0.480838488982	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.181007768217	We have losers.
0.0	0.460675053419	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.391249761688	That will change everything.
0.0	0.318006347864	He couldn't answer the question.
0.0	0.303422260912	David, I am the very first...
0.0	0.453765050124	One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together.
0.0	0.508538211501	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.486072134145	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.411720803134	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.402569572959	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.137544146592	Maria...
0.0	0.439114741597	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.425324775627	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.510665381909	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
1.0	0.441704078528	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.421820581435	And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
0.0	0.597929793896	No.
0.0	0.299445302773	How are we gonna -- how are we gonna go back and make it great again?
0.0	0.5	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
0.0	0.434313206365	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.469700436781	And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending.
0.0	0.287413676572	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.436537822582	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.285578119396	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.172188732553	I can't do it.
0.0	0.385298220498	I would invite him, I actually would say.
0.0	0.493285009384	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.433818650549	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.306125143262	She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship.
0.0	0.51750477835	Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.
0.0	0.444365395742	You know where their United States headquarters is located?
0.0	0.1247146829	...Chris...
0.0	0.549315878777	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.522588734327	Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.
0.0	0.446499622586	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.417680277216	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.511110392708	By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started.
1.0	0.452831502944	Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion.
0.0	0.268633682614	They're a scam.
0.0	0.452739044909	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.
0.0	0.337784724521	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.423524759121	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.393883664881	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
0.0	0.4569608427	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.407358187279	Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
0.0	0.467434499648	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.480707357354	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.418563487203	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.400428149201	I will put a price tag.
1.0	0.516156262727	In fact, wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century, after my husband's administration.
0.0	0.391949710569	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.374483019873	You want to know why things don't get done in Washington?
0.0	0.490929888909	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.438074310266	I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.470247893591	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.4208856138	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.425746385241	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.273239047078	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.450777731353	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.424170634447	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.452121600029	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.468939079455	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.485714139135	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.437042579789	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.376081930194	Let me give you the bad news.
0.0	0.288011209765	And here's what's going to happen.
0.0	0.423127957594	You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question.

0.0	0.316184807388	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.461552010042	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.490509846186	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.

0.0	0.379869760873	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.388556166043	I never said that.

0.0	0.442677176117	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.5	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.421112492939	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.437108113609	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.491932082111	And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.5	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.

0.0	0.480538315906	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.464519032576	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.253956693743	Bigger than that?

0.0	0.260578231144	I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.42058680949	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.597929793896	...
0.0	0.40730120779	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.413382716139	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.373804179843	You can go to my website...
0.0	0.5	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
1.0	0.439002535451	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.411450273441	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.480454757734	Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978.
0.0	0.400298599153	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.49411365852	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.483264875873	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.310713157664	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.445147603385	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
0.0	0.494452066697	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.

0.0	0.408711925024	They have no plan now."
0.0	0.456798940595	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.446016080903	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
0.0	0.528876295099	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.

0.0	0.432601876373	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.414831178991	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.45888351072	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.44122339156	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.477713006232	Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country -- we would never build in an ocean.
0.0	0.409897145339	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.385417947582	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.455310299763	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.443199274302	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.5	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.
0.0	0.472546001674	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.436134813058	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
0.0	0.426031326782	Now we're having smaller families.
1.0	0.821673783825	And again, paid for.

0.0	0.385904248383	He cut and run.
0.0	0.5	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.523195723139	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
0.0	0.414077930909	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.

1.0	0.470578329631	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.409557921612	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
1.0	0.760659670904	It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.
0.0	0.463022145825	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.337870871706	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.36738932242	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.41564397431	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.471194442127	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.277435313526	That's for sure.
0.0	0.444429316752	And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go.
0.0	0.453811306967	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.434882035191	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.353947026898	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.
0.0	0.423710592292	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.5	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.396009422933	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.473163872879	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.37489283173	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.
0.0	0.484158940808	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.445050229647	Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.386835526743	I don't think the term is what's important.
0.0	0.408404940195	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.481061081319	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.448008182795	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.423100599467	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --

0.0	0.371429068175	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.399525088576	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.390269234798	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.403765630638	Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.
0.0	0.390229761457	So, yes, I did know people.
0.0	0.336957995075	We need more principle.
0.0	0.445798870806	But if you place good ones, you pocket it.
0.0	0.427799677096	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.172188732553	We can't do it.
0.0	0.412629035546	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.435676870465	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.389528829127	I'm using my own money.
0.0	0.415696743083	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.396115784961	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.408532622123	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.451763620871	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.3776745098	This will end.
0.0	0.442731817251	First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.328595898552	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.
0.0	0.597929793896	No -- no...
0.0	0.5	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.533822714907	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.422781727233	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.310427987292	I will be ready.
0.0	0.444443339985	The first vote hasn't been counted.
0.0	0.462479840194	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.313648073493	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
0.0	0.398203392773	That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them.
0.0	0.466062424002	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.
0.0	0.3447008565	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.437696214722	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.473881617368	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.472761052099	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.14822507947	I didn't.
0.0	0.426024585919	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.311165744837	I think so, right.
0.0	0.427473905302	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.426286502993	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.444988413698	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.480386329622	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.291468875962	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.475735518962	Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military.
0.0	0.434539985921	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.36929669964	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.425798256833	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.467043199951	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.187491635418	Creativity.
0.0	0.377957712385	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.258154106181	Check it out.
0.0	0.5	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.425274649888	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.409142385372	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.359131751279	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.493387614725	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.443502567265	Wall Street is a threat to the economy.
0.0	0.410904196132	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.448142141831	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.511339660628	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.225200095971	Absolutely.
0.0	0.490394234592	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.469151307205	I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out.
0.0	0.314466017884	It feels different.
0.0	0.472391882386	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.417214398706	I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
0.0	0.462102110403	You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down.
0.0	0.475142575024	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.403861629519	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.350690296498	Of course not.
0.0	0.507349901313	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.182193540067	Excuse me.
0.0	0.438223014069	A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this.
0.0	0.5	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.39573583779	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.37957676456	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.447628164728	I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college.
0.0	0.30398164263	Thank you very, very much.
0.0	0.247355084657	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.440712334252	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.403530449597	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.429822423381	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.489994687239	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.453357563308	If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.
0.0	0.5	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.440896251181	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.380492112987	I would put it in a blind trust.

0.0	0.228396365071	He was vibrant.
0.0	0.469786365636	ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.
0.0	0.365934936637	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.48024756024	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.467731087458	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.512328596817	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.474045511251	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.
0.0	0.366310347545	But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com.

0.0	0.340511600609	I don't need the rhetoric.
0.0	0.484567067434	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.486676198094	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.402303492706	He invoked mine as well.
0.0	0.321904524758	I'll say this.
0.0	0.5	My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.
0.0	0.433337716629	And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.
0.0	0.475294207907	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.42269304073	But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it.
0.0	0.522405955919	We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations.
0.0	0.344357944754	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.383256324538	And that's just not acceptable.

0.0	0.447647843434	In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America.
0.0	0.597929793896	But...

0.0	0.39237325749	Could I just say -- just say this...

0.0	0.317997722568	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.422811690113	So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.
0.0	0.447222811517	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.471080205611	We have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as General Dempsey said.
0.0	0.535281804744	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.378228564615	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.430911420169	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.487158073885	And when he moved on his own people, threatening a massacre, genocide, the Europeans and the Arabs, our allies and partners, did ask for American help and we provided it.

0.0	0.282352933727	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.529163298433	So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.
0.0	0.455855512229	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.480450688361	Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.482834279928	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.408435783851	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.398387925316	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
1.0	0.910954805153	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.429462469821	Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.337354086121	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.452411363974	I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.486620751075	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.261178727759	I tell you that.
0.0	0.26492277686	Yes.
0.0	0.479005126921	Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.
1.0	0.802298014833	They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.
0.0	0.159571780446	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.443006986933	Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.
0.0	0.361193632982	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.511500195274	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.493574433614	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.461135036013	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.485338726601	It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.
0.0	0.417467692023	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.478493054727	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.433091667499	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.351686380968	You just want to...
0.0	0.396469319041	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.463641912422	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.383921144024	And a lot of people are doing that.
0.0	0.399769382455	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.380452010645	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.394090778189	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.430568548644	And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage.
0.0	0.505074350043	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.407520658611	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.332206581367	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.390851970512	Common Core should -- it is a disaster.
0.0	0.455618754353	Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.
0.0	0.306502276007	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.384115111922	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.269657128264	I will do that.
0.0	0.465069929791	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.510054285756	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
0.0	0.457912170131	We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.
0.0	0.44417384569	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.5	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.377981986261	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.487784304626	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.486300633738	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
1.0	0.849113860864	Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.
0.0	0.410952914867	Everybody thought the deal was dead.
0.0	0.285145684693	There's give and take.
0.0	0.433186486822	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.445894422462	I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...
0.0	0.314315554797	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.392708669925	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
1.0	0.753203332574	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.442161605364	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.514453174479	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
1.0	0.704064419368	The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.
0.0	0.169015696753	Yeah.
0.0	0.349393654067	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.395708709435	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.310902772776	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.410148989831	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.438845827646	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.441193315164	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.426348112434	That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.
0.0	0.379258128982	... first of all...
0.0	0.437467132436	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.407228442035	Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging.
0.0	0.455812422678	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.367591874705	We will do very, very well, very, very well.
0.0	0.441180101256	It's a country in which people choose to buy guns.
0.0	0.416818710095	But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.
0.0	0.49261513293	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.14822507947	No, you weren't.
0.0	0.275518343761	And you know what?
0.0	0.425999796471	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.282172872839	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.264739249634	No, I think they won't.
0.0	0.5	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.453367286229	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.35193345033	John, may I -- may I interject here?
0.0	0.462588148915	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...
0.0	0.182193540067	Excuse me, no.
0.0	0.275518343761	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.35519784274	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.438120079932	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.318547000824	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.506780865929	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.597929793896	So what do we do?
0.0	0.350370667601	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
0.0	0.437182702929	Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.317063222648	I'm really rich.
0.0	0.282368907828	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.438015358499	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.413910571018	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.44848846411	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
0.0	0.181007768217	We have losers.
0.0	0.383941552064	I think we all support it.
0.0	0.432396331219	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.384606470687	Get rid of the fraud.
0.0	0.299625080882	It is not because of the tax writeoff.
0.0	0.24842472512	I don't have to brag.
0.0	0.450353349546	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.463391208979	and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States.
0.0	0.315799087118	You get a lot of them that are overrated.
0.0	0.426868917307	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.
0.0	0.528946791895	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.379075480131	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.391949280874	You cannot grant amnesty.
0.0	0.362707167457	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.393560543175	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.147432964743	So was I, John.
0.0	0.41127934597	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
1.0	0.854976308176	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
0.0	0.412582971073	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.447050941591	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.437255831334	As governor, we continued to work together.
0.0	0.5	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.461165075651	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.316568037698	Well, I did.
0.0	0.43888904151	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.479931601502	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.381735527986	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.530904252984	We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.
0.0	0.27554842989	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.506362936398	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.278911594141	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.38129381156	But I...
0.0	0.476556239087	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.414964251394	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.359993852068	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.45490915208	We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground.
0.0	0.395291127446	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.207487114135	OK?
0.0	0.454922703334	So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income.
0.0	0.420135192816	You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.
0.0	0.523254922106	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.423328427381	Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves.
0.0	0.40079925583	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.455609377463	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.461369888967	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.443685445295	And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it.
0.0	0.511245397977	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.199819610999	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.332820459083	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.467347692571	And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump," and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns.
0.0	0.490668190683	If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.
0.0	0.416798699592	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.208353643923	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.419327451938	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.523909468639	Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.
0.0	0.42845269976	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.464480731877	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.433038443145	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.444995772783	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.416135180851	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.433420612057	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.
0.0	0.360561768798	A brief response.
0.0	0.395900309664	The troops on the ground should not be American troops.
0.0	0.462413857801	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.479363799325	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.279780318911	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.46465157139	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.471095431944	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.487352515186	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.439427995211	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.482055329974	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.597929793896	But...
0.0	0.475192151604	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.467973410992	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.480292274168	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.44831781132	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.
0.0	0.33397513167	I said, "Very interesting."
0.0	0.412783839837	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.411220568318	We both made the identical promises.
0.0	0.421615404831	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
0.0	0.394015122513	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.364156904004	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.469682226158	We have fought, as Democrats, for decades to get a health care plan.
0.0	0.462547357156	We now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act, and I don't think we should have to be defending it among Democrats.
0.0	0.455263046028	We also have to build a coalition at home.
0.0	0.459007686333	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.393242681556	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.488741060591	When those buildings came down, she was trapped in her building and I didn't hear from her over six hours.
0.0	0.32999084802	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.457541697548	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
0.0	0.471137894246	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.350417265372	Obama is going to be out playing golf.
0.0	0.444425123309	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.320365896889	I'm going to be independent.
0.0	0.364589857435	That's the secondary issue.
0.0	0.449968932237	I hire people, they do a Web site.
0.0	0.411189610864	We now finally are where we need to be.
0.0	0.494690290259	Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it.
0.0	0.346312427797	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.487050162054	All through the recession, we defended the highest median income in America and the second highest median income for African American families.
0.0	0.454193826851	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.486999043847	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.426760580454	You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well.
0.0	0.5	I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.
0.0	0.374549300783	Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.
0.0	0.407609420503	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.304708245636	... not everybody else.
0.0	0.392322961119	We have people that aren't smart.
0.0	0.443899684797	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.
0.0	0.432674489091	I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.
0.0	0.439442083733	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.360926808738	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.
0.0	0.413056886993	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.509474451497	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.472458269908	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.358603314747	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.
0.0	0.335756490701	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.452451436057	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.371705697736	They don't even have a chance.
0.0	0.447749368928	As president, I would make the administrator of USAID an actual cabinet member.
0.0	0.597929793896	No.
0.0	0.50739094611	We didn't win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America.
0.0	0.413408345744	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.491706391402	You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.
0.0	0.371746893338	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.418980218902	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
0.0	0.443961970659	Bill after coming home from Japan, flying 33 missions.
0.0	0.422641916512	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.481101872148	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.474600761066	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.481132082359	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.30398164263	Thank you very much.
1.0	0.77592309038	And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.
0.0	0.111638712549	Thank you.
0.0	0.47144456153	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.466499921356	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.5	Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care.
0.0	0.481282410201	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
0.0	0.597929793896	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.513332624034	And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
0.0	0.365813927082	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.464260370733	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.450810157346	And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.
0.0	0.420104917181	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.524453097087	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.524225311788	Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.
0.0	0.458279829654	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
0.0	0.340872897932	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.528792368714	What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.464745766799	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.411524313081	They went to the DNC quietly.
0.0	0.3650107515	That's just media stuff.
1.0	0.733946232398	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.548147950878	We're spending over $600 billion a year on the military and yet, significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism.
0.0	0.321103107512	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.417325197161	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.48577142276	We defended the highest median income in the country.
0.0	0.436778623691	But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here.
0.0	0.393438587543	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.429741502427	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.451925086733	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.452317601937	Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.
0.0	0.372266656102	Ask Boeing.
0.0	0.439978068908	And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country.
0.0	0.372983195284	... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
0.0	0.482986119116	It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
0.0	0.419820319637	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.329592348801	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.597929793896	No.
0.0	0.492302523988	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.391919536854	And there is a lot we can do in college affordability.
0.0	0.446177750636	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.478179141043	It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested.
0.0	0.154543379484	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
0.0	0.45771212611	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.494325919186	What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people.
0.0	0.431692495469	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.48052272342	And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.
0.0	0.353692566881	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.482536037922	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.278893742793	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.107746008701	And we are not England.
0.0	0.364916845332	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
0.0	0.293607030414	He didn't know.
0.0	0.41595653567	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
0.0	0.251134676755	They're not so stupid.
0.0	0.41517513622	Now, you'd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me?
0.0	0.485245101216	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.356356278574	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.243439192753	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.437258236059	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
1.0	0.474416716448	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.417002421853	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.5	And also -- also, what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health care outcomes are not necessarily that good.
0.0	0.285564695167	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.305139320644	What a brilliant idea that would be.
0.0	0.410387400787	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.490082722652	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.481007123504	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.371084545549	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.507554542366	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.291956155514	That's right.
0.0	0.27596471091	Well, thank you.
0.0	0.29140259415	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.286027580134	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.266295253045	You count on it.
0.0	0.258162716823	Bill.
0.0	0.444145696666	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.358760771163	We're ready to start shooting."
0.0	0.359769057633	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.159571780446	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.446992152961	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.41829213149	She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.446724916056	So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
1.0	0.536835997439	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.275518343761	How do I know this?
0.0	0.257505351144	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.477798277454	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.365960945447	They don't know if it worked.
1.0	0.709550595714	Today, we have about 4,000.
0.0	0.5	But bottom line now, is in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or her family.
0.0	0.446677620954	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.331753917481	It didn't have the votes to pass.
0.0	0.302612272515	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.443465874609	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.425460445998	If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out.
0.0	0.37830943371	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
1.0	0.482831923315	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.399133489079	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.368735777584	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.494771601004	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.
0.0	0.443635705939	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.450989922798	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.493983704054	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.
0.0	0.441300645414	From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made.
0.0	0.47184970491	So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years -- you know, we're at $8 trillion now.
0.0	0.380627086168	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.480887242395	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.349571278694	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.467382087666	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.396755363543	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.35858692991	My patients are beside themselves.
0.0	0.418928622208	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.517216396912	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.485426287985	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.329702622383	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.
0.0	0.470262312454	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.349652439813	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.294473230297	And I'm confident we can do that.

0.0	0.465370717154	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.343121755648	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.5	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.436919805003	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.424461961306	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.486677152809	So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.
1.0	0.804474028928	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.452008130551	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.244631495605	I love China.
0.0	0.490227436271	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.597929793896	It is.
0.0	0.293788221548	Chris, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.412263179108	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.472493996275	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.5	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.391835448849	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.520042183678	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.336563757744	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.333140946527	It's hate action.
0.0	0.473522752981	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.425385531506	But I guess the final thing that -- that I would say is this is the kind of debate we need to take to the Republicans in the fall.
0.0	0.456496546264	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.

0.0	0.528226005267	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.450198991801	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.453687081167	Sit down with people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the house, and work on a bill.
0.0	0.473211822197	... we have the tools in federal law to do this now.
0.0	0.264971087905	And we're gonna be there very soon.

0.0	0.251151054139	We got it.
0.0	0.370452009912	When I'm president, that will change.
0.0	0.597929793896	No, I have not.
0.0	0.466702312756	And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.
0.0	0.597929793896	...
0.0	0.535653151531	They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care.
0.0	0.467826737341	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.463592408375	I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that's what Iowans like to do.
0.0	0.313939157735	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.428663257992	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.391793447057	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.43066337356	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.462229315168	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.434572545127	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.360628020236	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
0.0	0.436411231671	As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
0.0	0.263348531524	Who denies that it is crazy...
0.0	0.440337249827	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.398898308137	So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
0.0	0.396754548445	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.509903925016	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.597929793896	That's what it is.
0.0	0.456707761979	It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.
0.0	0.371710581744	He has never defended...
0.0	0.342787424779	Kevin, if I could just jump in.
0.0	0.394698967611	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.37028902496	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.484742254194	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.5	If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
0.0	0.389126152466	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.
0.0	0.426581936987	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.459106275051	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.456477015993	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.
0.0	0.292987476168	That's what really matters.
0.0	0.597929793896	Why?
0.0	0.268633682614	They're a scam.
0.0	0.392660838192	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
1.0	0.43844145759	And the overall message is that it doesn't result in job loss.
0.0	0.250884366381	A step forward.
0.0	0.362610143514	And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.
0.0	0.445732156649	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
1.0	0.845471185238	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.384930765695	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.444382310081	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.244631495605	I love China.
0.0	0.480830620275	I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.474530590889	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.424155389611	Well, you've got to be on top of it right away.
0.0	0.512758347121	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.445316799103	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
1.0	0.477782076413	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.322814198234	Came out great.
0.0	0.38746826924	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.462350746384	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.
0.0	0.437660241044	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.448126335155	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.
0.0	0.398948839859	We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression.
0.0	0.442589166898	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.459312307335	So the total is $8,737,540,00.
0.0	0.597929793896	No.
0.0	0.457317155463	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.
0.0	0.354261138122	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.312495375567	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.515394185343	They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
0.0	0.471618696173	And those countries who are opposed to Islam, they are going to have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today.
0.0	0.347086535666	But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.
0.0	0.413564462564	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.299264148618	Jared (ph), Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family.
0.0	0.345694933671	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.207487114135	OK?
0.0	0.385793457225	Planned Parenthood will be defunded.
0.0	0.493076463076	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.4434419243	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.597929793896	It was...
0.0	0.443773736061	And most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that.
0.0	0.428588821573	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.361815975778	The bill would involve legalization.
0.0	0.376762629575	Fact check me.
0.0	0.328868446624	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.272527595457	Let me...
0.0	0.426313162118	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.427743685062	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.
1.0	0.728727100929	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.405615585369	I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video.
0.0	0.404902868523	And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.
0.0	0.447300949814	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.322115584296	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.47790766572	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.
0.0	0.489403659522	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
1.0	0.775554735697	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.402483861951	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.306502276007	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.44006570323	David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave.
0.0	0.416062366617	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.452124143267	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.362205360685	We need to define the enemy.
0.0	0.363595243388	By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa.
0.0	0.456668060243	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.465247685552	Make ourselves stronger at home, but also our role in the world, yes, is also to confront evil when it rises.
0.0	0.429702650921	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.263531934892	What about hydroelectric power?
0.0	0.402377435441	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.361705021185	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.463368255832	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.188616320569	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.397757294567	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.26492277686	Yes.
0.0	0.434637403077	We ought to send used equipment, right?
0.0	0.467074790631	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.456946051336	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.333689238393	Hey, I have lobbyists.
0.0	0.410131969793	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.51140499057	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.433655779403	Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody.
0.0	0.417888842081	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.350452537196	Might I respond?
0.0	0.341322277393	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.444745735243	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.
0.0	0.460754254489	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.433124842633	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.439431773381	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.208731583149	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.374637460389	But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
0.0	0.446284139018	And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.
0.0	0.48591507873	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.335651034148	I've always listened to you, Megyn.
0.0	0.371728101877	Somebody said, "Oh, that's crass."
0.0	0.442351033125	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.493091307581	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.310071004685	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.509894390626	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.414385656636	We're going to cut costs.
1.0	0.5	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.438611343782	I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism --
0.0	0.416044570292	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.441616874555	I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.
0.0	0.477091223321	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.473004434401	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.
0.0	0.383624807584	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.347017804439	We are at war with violent extremism.
1.0	0.216677617606	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.336214678715	We don't have victories anymore.
0.0	0.454453424446	Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS.
0.0	0.421148171784	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.477506414681	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
0.0	0.462493375814	I believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation.
0.0	0.176994316665	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.331237632092	Big difference.
