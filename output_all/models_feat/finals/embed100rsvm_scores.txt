0.0	0.150955609372	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.
0.0	0.12399938547	We're rebuilding many countries.

0.0	0.240162324246	I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.

0.0	0.539093257552	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.13259186392	And we also need a cheerleader.
1.0	0.132937720605	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.264996070158	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...
0.0	0.0805632905267	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.00949743705651	Think about it.
0.0	0.475471172064	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.277309772872	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.104601713311	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.11783333899	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.161787609126	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.808733782562	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.129470779449	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.0126120068636	And guess what?
0.0	0.384496061564	Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer.
0.0	0.152291234759	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.618582222288	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.0694814879507	I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.
0.0	0.0801684385557	Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.298101895517	And that's only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.
0.0	0.0858797277852	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.332081177936	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.5	I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal.
0.0	0.245953133684	But, I said, "This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people.
0.0	0.168770512321	I would just say that...
0.0	0.301166527731	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.614159060525	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.551298467735	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.554694543257	About Medicare?
0.0	0.243698007826	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.484585191514	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.37716575506	And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow.
0.0	0.15648483434	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.275714670051	We were the first in the family.
0.0	0.450331822184	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.104065174345	That's a wonderful business model.
0.0	0.196932009623	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.361557155366	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.228775150312	They went to the DNC quietly.
0.0	0.486271074932	And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty.
0.0	0.223267954656	Let's do more -- let's do more than reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.166038024504	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.0712924230048	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.173064131286	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.382788510347	We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
0.0	0.204959091058	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.0655494713043	I think we're missing the point here.
0.0	0.0784796957361	Rebuild the country's infrastructure.
0.0	0.0616883343541	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.130392968992	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.349474126443	You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.
0.0	0.105000771249	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.103348525711	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.131067743026	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.182175902338	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.437723185129	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.227880027007	Yes.
0.0	0.353539859336	Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.185714790691	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.
0.0	0.15417938425	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.733204813184	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.222413736747	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
0.0	0.307417216289	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.114103632961	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.205340508718	So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.
0.0	0.832664990054	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.395338800639	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.201744063055	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.0450715926046	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.178678490586	But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said.
0.0	0.082871596032	Excuse me.
0.0	0.125114764399	That I can tell you.
0.0	0.374169383759	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.227266012928	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.0915525585509	She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship.
0.0	0.191223182955	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.235127363456	I do not believe in unilateral American action.
0.0	0.278686898718	People who we should be welcoming and working with.
0.0	0.467710918694	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.249295228516	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.313133813242	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.230377112094	The Turks are being threatened.
0.0	0.310034435822	And now many of these candidates want to cut it.
0.0	0.133405996998	So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.
0.0	0.34338925995	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.0859834687972	They thought something was wrong.
0.0	0.101201896165	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.5	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.203753746329	Everybody got out -- and they kept our equipment.
1.0	0.996023460288	So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education.
0.0	0.0880272405637	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.0595873334672	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.197484081635	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.225311600868	But...
0.0	0.196693400836	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.146141027521	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.1170329385	And I think this is an important question.
0.0	0.129314713292	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.194221099563	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.451175671388	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.89322371515	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.27212585931	We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.
0.0	0.0500374439942	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.352909712669	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.178198476138	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.29516453514	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.053855396571	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.085832777176	Let me say this.
0.0	0.371556802778	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.394126739767	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.217037782759	And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
0.0	0.124026862485	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.0989288971002	And that is what we have done in Ohio.
0.0	0.0688597414631	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.319881239742	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.166504117476	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.598116213802	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.170139061077	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.0330839764749	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.220829363709	We must able to work collaboratively with others.

0.0	0.875435134866	Seventeen more million more people have health care.
0.0	0.134804327892	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.105887440248	In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
0.0	0.215002841453	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.354158482996	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.554404944329	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.0388393261106	they expect to get something.
0.0	0.25018395792	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.
0.0	0.045415493348	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.0464386072021	I know how hard it is to build coalitions.
0.0	0.113772765557	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.0999075259273	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
0.0	0.0476900277826	This is the election...
0.0	0.229861233848	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.307454788844	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.0982281597479	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.101561120068	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.254814841967	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.331536455173	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.204738827086	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.132635922184	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.00900471019579	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.225369655008	That's not true.
0.0	0.352917141783	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.798467041623	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.220505025976	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.225311600868	It was against Assad.
0.0	0.265066456138	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.180572731726	How are they going to beat ISIS?
0.0	0.290956470334	They've advertised that.
0.0	0.217519742524	Go to YouTube.
0.0	0.166748645398	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
1.0	0.369920311274	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.383433190369	If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune.
0.0	0.308210716182	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.01762015373	We haven't.
0.0	0.5	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.305351759122	And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.101582282573	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.131918043318	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.119143650205	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.911582673654	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.335646489398	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
0.0	0.160493123591	We need sound money.
0.0	0.0441021037929	It won't happen.
0.0	0.275092881001	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.269571568985	Starting with our children and moving forward.
0.0	0.0462945118474	Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.
0.0	0.170842841389	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.
0.0	0.285265174945	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.345089666456	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.255333257523	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.264726303578	But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible.
0.0	0.30477219835	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.21366791676	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.0595808135358	Right.
0.0	0.757050903015	... saying, no middle class tax raises.
0.0	0.322302049054	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.315489764213	It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.
0.0	0.309402513113	She is not qualified to be President of the United States.
0.0	0.410779738171	In fact, if you remember, 50, 60 years ago, the University of California, City University of New York were virtually tuition-free.
0.0	0.175627142618	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.144481857164	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.398869861774	KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.
0.0	0.174281733233	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.403504001948	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.296242081824	Last point.
0.0	0.0654744111666	I totally get that.
0.0	0.309145938163	And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't.
0.0	0.237808494697	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.436448980706	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.12183287417	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.287142129277	When do we beat Mexico at the border?
0.0	0.150300337562	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.288460165889	Yes, and it was the same one that President Obama made.
0.0	0.103618554129	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.296759131267	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.424147253711	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.149666684586	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.287199648547	You know where their United States headquarters is located?
0.0	0.24747767727	We will -- when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice.
0.0	0.0225062443298	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.0207062492423	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.0902208889918	Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.
0.0	0.252845777615	He said, "Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."
0.0	0.298002255545	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
0.0	0.363927755249	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.251921978138	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.307417216289	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.383404190438	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.365767449958	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.363033923681	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
0.0	0.386794742544	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.180948507548	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.223278920134	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.334573911538	And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.126604178267	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
1.0	0.260321258314	They're rapists.
1.0	0.449844606587	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.274692842828	We can in fact create jobs and provide job security.
0.0	0.144126424902	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.1559941822	And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.
1.0	0.970463969886	That's wrong.
0.0	0.299549641127	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.187178652021	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.20793569801	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.422115662304	Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
0.0	0.310467672487	Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting...
0.0	0.25833656455	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.0732369072348	We will do very, very well, very, very well.
0.0	0.17894047843	It's not working.
0.0	0.182972967372	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.
0.0	0.375129672014	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.270971481498	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.256141684129	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.0477419852584	We have losers.
0.0	0.116964019152	You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.
0.0	0.254397790783	Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly.
0.0	0.0786275681081	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.389701935134	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.227880027007	Yes.
0.0	0.21466274904	I've dealt with them all my life.
0.0	0.600671069218	I do not support amnesty...
0.0	0.0182489906449	OK.
0.0	0.533641037898	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.131978793408	Absolutely.
0.0	0.338067166743	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.01762015373	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.183011650234	Planned Parenthood will be defunded.
0.0	0.250405550618	But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding.
1.0	0.741827389246	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.3764346091	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.383206602221	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.200634037604	We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.
0.0	0.80163382555	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.236487591122	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.172266919325	We were wrong.
0.0	0.582651747859	That's the wrong number.
0.0	0.129615222053	That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities.
0.0	0.328222053544	You can go to my website...
0.0	0.249781313429	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.390610439795	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.221145243627	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.193325332393	We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president.
0.0	0.187805310778	By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa.
0.0	0.43820745278	And I have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run.
0.0	0.301193926874	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.0909424443965	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.184240651172	The CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary.
0.0	0.134425558021	So was I, John.
0.0	0.0801290089955	That's my view.
0.0	0.403013035979	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.419653081704	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
0.0	0.180818432804	I say, "That's a terrible story.
0.0	0.362297143897	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.202858667093	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.26809539399	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.014679347405	Sure.
0.0	0.163137498885	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.0401324343192	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.128339629846	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.0392452873114	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.225311600868	...
0.0	0.26183766695	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.3859925108	What is the best way to do it?
0.0	0.36141764251	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
0.0	0.102092732774	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.221314087933	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.297556581841	Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.839956815682	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.801640410993	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.309810551221	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.493695178814	John, I would disagree with Secretary Clinton respectfully on this score.
0.0	0.560947906527	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.179301820529	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.21267480665	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.360351474907	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.188815024535	Now, our country needs -- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
0.0	0.395135452296	When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
0.0	0.50549286718	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.088050797864	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.0875225565763	I (inaudible).
0.0	0.192516147528	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.207934098565	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.445626909884	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.292553573154	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.349678525655	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.215168586432	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.303042364426	Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, who said my plan for what we should do to reign in Wall Street was more comprehensive and better.
0.0	0.125232855038	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.225311600868	What are we doing?
0.0	0.562988923475	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.250383147638	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.387700416763	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.506301984656	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.786700475011	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.507638522204	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.322863086817	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.
0.0	0.382185439233	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.383082498957	But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.
1.0	0.389110804622	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
1.0	0.360292481405	And some of them are like third world countries.
0.0	0.0558038107395	I am the son and grandson of immigrants.
0.0	0.00409831337456	...Thank you.
1.0	0.999999999706	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.318986589041	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.18305892806	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.352471344207	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.140447024945	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.200171526212	It didn't have the votes to pass.
0.0	0.397860201521	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.0775162570861	Chris?
0.0	0.170494972093	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.174611218988	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.
0.0	0.0157385022059	I agree with that.
0.0	0.213498434073	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.217924170203	But I went further than that.
0.0	0.259988295744	We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended.
0.0	0.107020236917	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.177796417808	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.285755457124	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.154786814995	I don't get any money from Wall Street.
0.0	0.0275255870787	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.4495843622	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.2274834316	I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war.
0.0	0.386287088194	Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons.
0.0	0.186796973568	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.0441774973009	And you know what?
0.0	0.0438477749315	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.290208170102	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.170777668779	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.0734906608741	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.946565558284	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.192419453915	Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS.
0.0	0.81904913008	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.527138276744	And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.
0.0	0.0601870409991	We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
0.0	0.229105001288	Two weeks later, the place was blown up.
0.0	0.282855892159	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.168564447849	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.302429013957	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.480215226908	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.449462966173	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.296493916246	But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.
0.0	0.25382767771	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.0156866175203	He's very charming.
0.0	0.568178701513	I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.
0.0	0.0821845418039	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.29407803948	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.
0.0	0.327436730936	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.313420460907	And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.
0.0	0.0735369854378	They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work.
0.0	0.330336853426	We have to do away with the strawman proposal.
0.0	0.147414154339	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.0610893574872	I'd like to offer a...
0.0	0.0507653084355	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.429494814935	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.0234674089027	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.238985723145	They elected moderate leaders.
0.0	0.0135423152395	I love China.
0.0	0.0726523419443	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.
0.0	0.123153595917	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.177364466691	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.0662565967628	But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.0240559072744	It sounds crass.
0.0	0.0270189332826	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.
0.0	0.290675118257	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.251629104387	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.0713690963767	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.
0.0	0.0782754666092	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.0441774973009	And you know what?
1.0	0.336053612673	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.173739871832	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.623718327262	I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org.
1.0	0.948082592968	And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph).
0.0	0.65925541159	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.0147745707988	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.288427652122	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.203097027893	I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.
1.0	0.983908586279	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.351706589757	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.130206302708	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.148197429633	That's just media stuff.
0.0	0.786954596898	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.209428677305	Donald Trump, for example -- I'm glad -- I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him...
0.0	0.44898211834	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.382602036517	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.285075730882	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.383858740503	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.146714528373	Did a couple of cataract surgeries over Christmas holidays.
0.0	0.225311600868	We do.
0.0	0.0666255229829	I think it's a good product.
1.0	0.99552439868	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.160493123591	We need sound money.

0.0	0.285668364671	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.373223241814	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.421893014136	... that's the -- that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration.
0.0	0.280825311507	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.257595372509	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.0905572590388	It's hate action.

0.0	0.478154418407	They don't want to raise the minimum wage, they don't want to do anything to increase incomes.
0.0	0.416999175128	But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said.
0.0	0.115276690535	That's fine.
0.0	0.078465808031	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.255344477783	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.270930243898	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.172757430383	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.0441774973009	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.357606594898	And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details.
0.0	0.0335585182168	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.523223605438	We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001.
0.0	0.260447530491	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.164165813863	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.102021251918	Check it out.

0.0	0.290667415597	So protect the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.125250601464	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.
0.0	0.219917834375	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.455309276358	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.198908036691	And that this world, with American leadership, can and must come together to destroy them.
0.0	0.0531046306267	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.223096221756	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.125114764399	Can I tell you what?

0.0	0.0862883272471	I just want a job.
0.0	0.0631572735973	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.0402632710862	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.253930396366	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.0622951739425	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.446521644327	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.458769121287	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.216910706528	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.159571951298	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.0710883532067	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.0552230323482	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.562113253497	We have three children, eight, five and one.
0.0	0.258125633685	Hey, I have lobbyists.
0.0	0.199888507002	Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond...
0.0	0.0173899147785	There is a vacuum.
0.0	0.120436633077	That is exactly...
0.0	0.150622034176	But I...
0.0	0.540590538847	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
0.0	0.136893854802	He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long.
0.0	0.36270148099	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.0681173221497	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.0609674818572	They don't know how to bring it about.
0.0	0.174017001725	I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.
0.0	0.137144344606	They can't lead us.
0.0	0.129110801637	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.
0.0	0.338284715719	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
1.0	0.99173423323	But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.
0.0	0.12768703319	If not, they can stay where they are.
0.0	0.211867299962	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.218409161927	It's not about Donald Trump.
0.0	0.304570537401	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.188941082579	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.242562404163	And we have to stop all the divisions.
0.0	0.269135689961	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.202188945005	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.179240852776	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.
0.0	0.719923450685	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.0565383646605	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.0670979678137	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.346152563602	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.384608902171	That's what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I'm proud that they're supporting my campaign.
0.0	0.0225289567378	Divide that out.
0.0	0.113164306414	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.5343383305	Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS.
0.0	0.287217066796	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.269313021992	Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago.
0.0	0.573051337508	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.183907044933	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.089317855113	You know, the situation is this.
0.0	0.0710848459541	If he'd like to play, that's fine.
0.0	0.42807184337	And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.
0.0	0.301644411944	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.0786094819444	Thank you Chris...
0.0	0.0615207232084	And that's what I will do as your president.
0.0	0.212964791119	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.204548382178	How the hell can you vote for this guy?
0.0	0.0618105270324	You're right about that.
0.0	0.107062948466	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.20350146537	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.197165034353	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.103843243635	You want one?
1.0	0.900256712856	He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.
0.0	0.272939924679	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.113294211222	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.380833744607	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.238332542241	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.
0.0	0.241201932348	We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
0.0	0.772378120763	But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.
0.0	0.231899732406	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.751444174109	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
0.0	0.659115164927	People died, and only three people have been fired.
0.0	0.0673211316485	And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
0.0	0.445295287274	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.282523250397	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.290226326252	He's the one that did Bergdahl.
0.0	0.760569022349	So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.
0.0	0.379346241025	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
1.0	0.960751010843	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.0640712805965	So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.
0.0	0.0783039103198	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.78268206018	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.420120464832	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.

0.0	0.64665235956	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.306314690802	So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.
0.0	0.396550592295	And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.704045138491	But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it.

0.0	0.346611191516	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.678181378603	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.

0.0	0.0182489906449	OK?

0.0	0.0171874544772	Sorry.
0.0	0.28172541316	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.0095140662348	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.318135379455	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.0362454041031	We don't need that.
0.0	0.268108136545	Well, I just think you're asking a question with a false choice.
0.0	0.26397108827	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.259704441944	None of that information was looked at.
0.0	0.0970532362673	And I said, "I know.
0.0	0.178400736984	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.0993185025468	We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels.
0.0	0.433798294197	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.200606247802	I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses.
0.0	0.288951252313	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
0.0	0.177592381459	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.313693273694	There are many crises that come -- a water crisis in Toledo.
0.0	0.29676275636	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.379813081546	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.0545139166497	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.225569962888	I mean, let's talk about this arc of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about.
0.0	0.206443200045	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.14560951918	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.92935624003	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.167370318948	We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.
0.0	0.303152496673	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.183387978899	I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
0.0	0.295094177338	Like we have a -- we have a lot of work to do and we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do.
0.0	0.10076524034	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.218524788271	How does that help us?  TRUMP R 15 94 1 N Where is that good?
0.0	0.171562237979	Thank you, good night and may the force be with you.
0.0	0.225268594629	I was in Burlington, Iowa.
0.0	0.142335166408	My oldest daughter's a teacher.
0.0	0.208283389132	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.173593442771	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.172420944533	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.178033988462	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
1.0	0.113814133926	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.298807387687	In all due respect...
0.0	0.191583522457	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.394884428383	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.433120899597	So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
0.0	0.366136726728	There's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.
0.0	0.0820921154757	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.415359044756	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.259955939323	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
1.0	0.999993881083	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
0.0	0.130391147334	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.186840973079	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.068689004081	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.309942100953	And all over New Hampshire, I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose.
0.0	0.188814735797	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.321713808097	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.288999160995	He's in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.131489803892	We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations.
0.0	0.234428418011	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
1.0	0.999999987265	Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.
0.0	0.2897618578	And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.
0.0	0.482702669858	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
0.0	0.195680059438	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.
0.0	0.318906989009	If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences.
0.0	0.410340668724	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.274575666919	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.820453712762	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.29251039446	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.0757711746126	They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists.
0.0	0.278823316194	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
1.0	0.982600136126	And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.
0.0	0.492603535313	You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super PAC and they're advertising against me in Iowa as we speak.
0.0	0.0619366297508	But we don't know.
0.0	0.133485222026	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.3311386526	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
0.0	0.261559679528	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.0597314629566	I know the overrated ones.
0.0	0.397585513042	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.254784169313	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.121724686087	How stupid are our leaders?
0.0	0.415407547728	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.235233760987	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.322184260777	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.385936382065	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.23053294802	Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens.
0.0	0.478901220487	You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks.
0.0	0.0395336165512	I'm ready.
0.0	0.101518513932	That's a drag on the economy.
0.0	0.114635101053	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.486229678855	We now have that.
0.0	0.103048200524	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.119453573986	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.0598911148167	You are not our adversary, you are our partner.
0.0	0.169772343775	I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path.
0.0	0.665392692851	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.22476661268	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.270960491585	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.589295468794	Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.
0.0	0.333192343637	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.257509865774	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.186116355991	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.597626202132	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.0202948438251	You know, I like Marco.
0.0	0.213205838998	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.104951668179	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.163969930731	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
0.0	0.310508939407	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.
0.0	0.0989576076004	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.130656054748	But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.
0.0	0.357472606981	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.0962152335865	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.0592486048878	He's a progressive economist.
0.0	0.00949743705651	Kathie, I think -- Kathie the...
0.0	0.233065969471	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.394560606561	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.492222262661	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.412091031299	I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.
0.0	0.106797302575	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.164496789397	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.256134848051	We have people that don't have it.
0.0	0.557335373851	Some of the bravest people that I had the privilege of working with as secretary of state were our development professionals who went sometimes alone, sometimes with our military, into very dangerous places in Iraq, in Afghanistan, elsewhere.
0.0	0.249094605103	And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
0.0	0.135551434642	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.225311600868	No.
0.0	0.184189381201	When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal?
0.0	0.153021687014	And Abdullah said something recently, very important.
0.0	0.202911877459	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.00900471019579	Wow.
0.0	0.280516457125	Are you not running?
0.0	0.542519503	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.0778311664998	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.227008611957	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.0540758010285	It can happen.
0.0	0.173010180994	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.391807547157	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.195539598738	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.0816697181349	Jared (ph), Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family.
0.0	0.0743676054777	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.125323584101	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.567533608017	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.372472364884	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
1.0	0.999982205728	I lost that election by three percentage points.
0.0	0.313391131966	When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.
0.0	0.570763488045	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.103861368137	Listen, we can solve immigration.
0.0	0.200653826139	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.0552757219382	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.13135987519	We need new leadership.
0.0	0.210000726231	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.147618213983	I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
0.0	0.222007274893	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.117903606678	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
1.0	0.796318779859	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.678413792408	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.133736594587	And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.
0.0	0.14453634554	Does anyone know this?"
0.0	0.388491027015	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.0597760814274	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.520947641342	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.
0.0	0.290455078207	But wait, I just want to say this Senator.
0.0	0.358834120158	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.0457153674717	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.102635581904	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.287007477983	And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.
0.0	0.676746787791	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.37298243606	The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.
0.0	0.0884864337397	There are a lot of things we've got to do in our country, reigning in Wall Street is certainly one of them.
0.0	0.00625971669405	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.484033318142	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.226561126898	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.441255227229	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.204228408525	We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.
0.0	0.0494807644172	I think that would have been right, as well.
1.0	0.959449650482	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
0.0	0.116591983546	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.126854401571	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.426923842637	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.300384781399	The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.
0.0	0.233924447897	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
1.0	0.833707946655	People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.
0.0	0.154132050006	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.0145003961632	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
0.0	0.753240071812	Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor.
0.0	0.131543789701	I've had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say, I don't agree with you on everything, but I like what you do.
0.0	0.347476519928	And I'll tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign.
1.0	0.510390463956	According to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.805320382917	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
1.0	0.949327106781	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.950157491007	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.182887096357	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
0.0	0.086624961034	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.150397652559	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.0207062492423	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.471131733011	The bill would involve legalization.
0.0	0.134425558021	...John...

0.0	0.0475000804565	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.411944529448	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.

0.0	0.203411968154	It's very important we operate on both at the same time.
0.0	0.168151210818	We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.
0.0	0.454248220097	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.

0.0	0.333158048701	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.
0.0	0.252297370619	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."

0.0	0.111941837351	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.21890413255	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.493370929462	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.488108451169	We bailed them out.

0.0	0.312713817397	It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
0.0	0.0595808135358	All right.
1.0	0.098983084719	The 500,000 who came home with PTSD, and traumatic brain injury.
0.0	0.88831503077	We end up paying the highest prices in the world.
0.0	0.5666056572	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.317248946573	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.

0.0	0.5	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.227768610233	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.310716750681	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.252439393006	He invoked mine as well.
0.0	0.203593373748	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.49036634759	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.265778999131	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.5	No hour is too short, no dollar too small.
0.0	0.17944013716	But this is what we also have to say.
0.0	0.409100412357	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.16473529054	So -- because we got to make the country rich.
0.0	0.220302809637	I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States and literally around the world that there is a "clash of civilizations," that there is some kind of Western plot or even "war against Islam," which then I believe fans the flames of radicalization.
0.0	0.0452218925828	In this building, in Trump Tower.
0.0	0.164256454316	Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.36487009681	A lot of people have jumped in here.
1.0	0.930408541618	It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.
0.0	0.448313865214	You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?
0.0	0.28632213297	End -- end Common Core.
0.0	0.199540759843	But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.31866239739	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.351916152425	She has devoted her life, when I was mayor of the city of Burlington, actually when I first met her, we started a youth office, which started a after-school programs for kids, started a child care center, started a youth newspaper.
0.0	0.343323468312	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.262857181742	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.086094671203	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.391429076001	I am telling the truth.
0.0	0.209111333147	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.571298725338	I want this bill to be voted down.
0.0	0.278418370092	I'll advertise my Web site as well.
0.0	0.0257716261387	They can't.
0.0	0.167614802872	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.0878302556638	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.0922931789839	And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.
0.0	0.0617671512082	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
0.0	0.0740802110958	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.487274215909	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.161130848496	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.
0.0	0.0310716182277	We all understand that.
0.0	0.378523163178	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.129692708465	We can do that.
0.0	0.341022671216	And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.
0.0	0.157199955061	And they're wonderful people.
0.0	0.0304507652909	I will not do that.
0.0	0.356896116151	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.320822182096	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.171061053761	If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.
0.0	0.261361674552	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.376410493399	Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
0.0	0.227880027007	Yes.
0.0	0.599519125429	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.202436531502	What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger.
0.0	0.0966727292783	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.0602622434704	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.215146425066	So ladies and gentlemen...I am officially running...... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.
0.0	0.397322796074	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.187050327979	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.420008347492	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.377517077692	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.419975177074	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.146703844733	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.
0.0	0.125104318639	If I am elected president...
0.0	0.0975200262693	And it's-- it's a worthy debate.
0.0	0.26105480659	We ought to send used equipment, right?
0.0	0.450549338342	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.

0.0	0.108440436617	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.0949750989386	Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.
0.0	0.537152670787	Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military.
0.0	0.305694110127	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.391189174663	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.62504214419	They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?
0.0	0.142893463411	What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.
0.0	0.265741396104	So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.
0.0	0.190606058779	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.165788002353	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.183288730347	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.250049270015	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.130396616326	No, that's -- you're wrong.
1.0	0.710171531775	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.166722289448	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.248349210888	And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.
0.0	0.252899895513	When was the last time you heard China is killing us?
0.0	0.188390850823	I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie.
0.0	0.290553611881	How can you get people to vote for you?"
0.0	0.568978571475	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.354449143934	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.199390506192	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.429160171985	So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.
0.0	0.245129881115	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.411535052072	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.234064971759	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.0447409324198	We have the opposite thinking.
0.0	0.0776777129369	Let's keep going.
0.0	0.0603157604438	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.408426816196	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.0108486559177	He does great.
0.0	0.633594501892	We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
0.0	0.178069520865	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.259071310658	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.353218964779	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.574718138663	And, unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage, I actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.343419130642	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.5	But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired.
0.0	0.284594473494	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.183489318947	But if you place good ones, you pocket it.
0.0	0.11599872665	If you want to make it into the middle class -- I'm not saying in all cases -- we need plumbers, and we need carpenters, and electricians, that's for sure, and they should get help as well.
0.0	0.408838976144	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.37626244106	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.848738951443	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.306212717448	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.178443116333	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.0823043254356	We never dreamt we'd ever see it."
0.0	0.211166720118	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.343903426274	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.100800880289	And Teddy Roosevelt is right.
0.0	0.423134982376	They have no plan now."
0.0	0.182569466177	Well, I would just repeat that.
0.0	0.281898451795	The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
0.0	0.0275255870787	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.5	First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster.
0.0	0.464949364264	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.122066682796	Great state, great people.
0.0	0.6288612328	They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
0.0	0.515350650168	hospital that needs to be improved and made better for them turned over to privatization.
0.0	0.367857412018	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.252181790087	It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.
0.0	0.225369655008	That's not true.
0.0	0.259409205923	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.23039102173	We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.
0.0	0.603665486652	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.225311600868	No.
0.0	0.136938768138	But not for us.
0.0	0.363415234768	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.825808960669	He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration.
0.0	0.207543511432	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.
0.0	0.220748384361	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.273296263107	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.205114325979	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.648284652108	Who denies that it is crazy...
0.0	0.250230647651	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
0.0	0.216792361034	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.248930893645	The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court?
0.0	0.217313714422	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.262174947429	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.225311600868	What should we do?
0.0	0.62452866475	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.670029727473	It had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.133040703746	If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.
0.0	0.300620369918	It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.122337788198	You don't hear it from anybody else.
0.0	0.0866577645118	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.294629878251	But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.
0.0	0.115144810771	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.363150660982	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.067981869152	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
0.0	0.408951222879	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.223995475153	So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
0.0	0.341768224865	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.221482899963	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.230790613284	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.251147152774	I made it the old-fashioned way.
0.0	0.24650074004	One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy.
0.0	0.150607309454	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.133568619416	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.139497507469	We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.
0.0	0.637286213183	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.216005427301	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.333823657246	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.422009327612	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.242618651967	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.
0.0	0.298807387687	With all -- with all due respect...
0.0	0.330827876153	They can't even answer simple questions.
0.0	0.12932618829	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.289387849477	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.0293826584277	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.439155992466	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.0912115279022	That's the good news.
0.0	0.282450479876	So, in terms of refugees, I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe, with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that, of course, we reach out.
0.0	0.345303222423	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.698173042131	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.209586567121	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.3350972172	John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL, and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening.
0.0	0.0520586751416	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.0469104306981	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.457812022965	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
0.0	0.294173110099	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
0.0	0.578690860094	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.332987264567	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.136595379286	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.217356673372	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.212793341825	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.0495483644788	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.125323177065	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.124533839132	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.184765113438	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.382897357486	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.397591662319	As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country.
0.0	0.188894039374	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.481353445132	So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act.
0.0	0.356885625414	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.393244988105	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.0775054678646	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.925333456156	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...
0.0	0.254814276472	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.45070459834	We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York.
1.0	0.570686527671	Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.
0.0	0.418482486359	And I wrote a book about this called Immigration Wars.
0.0	0.141238168596	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.
0.0	0.63815510843	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.107913019671	Well, let me tell you this.
1.0	0.422831362605	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.108586855708	I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is.
0.0	0.242534277306	Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.
0.0	0.296433726438	We need money.
0.0	0.0980764954623	They were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.114191416386	We know about the Brits.
0.0	0.424390372294	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.0865528484173	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.0327438552034	They have no choice.
0.0	0.107837415045	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.283098078153	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.0695159319578	Well, I'll tell you who is on my side.
0.0	0.402689094735	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.118937281471	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.18980827538	And we need the right people.
0.0	0.195993847898	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.103078084318	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?
0.0	0.387984020942	I am on the committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.772355966837	Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally.
0.0	0.0995388172053	I will be ready.
0.0	0.670351684745	And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.
0.0	0.120618416774	Today I heard it.
0.0	0.804852078769	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.225369655008	That's true.
0.0	0.0925525096557	Neil?
0.0	0.278823316194	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.459567594186	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
0.0	0.0839517546159	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.248663741118	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.152720999952	We actually did it.
0.0	0.360513636387	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.235707989554	I believe that the goal should be debt-free college.
0.0	0.273254500074	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.477105088375	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.28626362025	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.147974361588	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.232765162521	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.0595808135358	Right.
0.0	0.270459417212	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
0.0	0.282039485219	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.389514260606	It's a country in which people choose to buy guns.
0.0	0.23532288342	The time to act is now.

0.0	0.0961295019133	That will change everything.
0.0	0.0317751836166	We listen to you and -- and then we act.
0.0	0.821053228016	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.026173396013	It is not a barbed wire fence.
0.0	0.193071536672	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.

0.0	0.144126424902	Let me respond...
0.0	0.131064398745	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.
0.0	0.239169865663	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.

0.0	0.386472311973	The American people are terrified.
0.0	0.121700836101	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.131548889019	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.0135423152395	I love China.
0.0	0.110946459068	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.18642873853	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
0.0	0.338527488398	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.29895564719	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.139623778135	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.227212413414	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.

1.0	0.966111562207	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.29038300324	I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider.

0.0	0.119291353591	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
0.0	0.180492300123	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.217879034028	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.156401626022	And what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.268094974807	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.109774546603	And that doesn't have to be true.

0.0	0.476547105602	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.0620217886473	...before I go.
0.0	0.416671636574	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.317461604247	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.0238929708755	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.0762861226936	We've gotten off the Hillary's e-mails, good.
0.0	0.0955776065354	I want to take care of women.

0.0	0.0396425058197	I've always listened to you, Megyn.
0.0	0.199319863212	Let's be frank here.
0.0	0.15290903392	May I respond to the critique on the ...
0.0	0.0302045535189	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.395936978338	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.
0.0	0.23759532941	The list goes on because the differences are so stark.
0.0	0.0595808135358	Right.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.225311600868	No.
0.0	0.133688956346	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.157847882104	Please become part of the political revolution.
0.0	0.311094454115	This is what's made our nation so special.
0.0	0.078225028758	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.10939581247	I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House.
1.0	0.826686449017	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.0722688635685	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.0558897791499	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.348137045335	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.195680973132	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.0595808135358	All right.
0.0	0.0581847414205	We don't know anything about that.
0.0	0.484190124319	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
1.0	0.73854574281	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.672892734968	Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force.
0.0	0.203357576372	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.339551075281	You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet...
0.0	0.112891870111	Martha, if I may...
0.0	0.0166511893257	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.0719873840197	So should the UK, so should France.
0.0	0.238191154165	Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.105125179148	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.272673382323	So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.
0.0	0.111491152049	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.660417641664	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.100594495194	Please reconsider, I'll say no.
0.0	0.198295821063	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.0167377789428	Looking forward to it.
0.0	0.164725374912	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.468485580448	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.868221105468	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.0903053303296	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.0236709882649	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.
0.0	0.281307692166	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
0.0	0.187665757428	It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
0.0	0.207601688028	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.190416588484	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.0640194991904	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.14494303204	But I think it's the right road for us to try to travel.
0.0	0.352963092649	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.092341510609	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.315454381882	When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.
0.0	0.0702341520954	And it has been amazing to me.
0.0	0.223534027536	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.721525724134	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.130331487636	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.466401406166	I -- you know, know that Senator Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers.
0.0	0.360420511314	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
0.0	0.30035685645	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.457779666849	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.335576390016	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
0.0	0.164141404043	I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.109036298375	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.21064245991	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.00769328047693	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.107653470299	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.225311600868	But...
0.0	0.119789049123	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.225311600868	So...
0.0	0.11108370442	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.407781729434	I led the effort, unfortunately unsuccessfully, against deregulation because I knew when you merge large insurance companies and investment banks and commercial banks it was not going to be good.
0.0	0.137257403085	And I believe he is absolutely right.
0.0	0.129692708465	I can do that.
0.0	0.333318415312	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.350540552595	We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.
0.0	0.242178831182	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.482609997023	But unlike either of these two fine people, I've actually balanced a budget every single year.
0.0	0.0783303018774	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
0.0	0.603921560293	It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act.
0.0	0.125366550616	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.0480674779362	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.245616144406	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.337634676461	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.0736623244527	You know, Ted didn't show up.
0.0	0.34838795577	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.525852791468	But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America.
0.0	0.220276391551	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.0104924550496	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.225311600868	No, you did.
0.0	0.330442242437	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.188739724659	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.18885969986	Well, I got it for two reasons.
0.0	0.664805218118	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.0646373688845	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.246038163402	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.625503886499	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.469393007224	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.377945346147	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
1.0	0.819543518477	$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work.
0.0	0.104414956269	(APPLAUSE)
1.0	0.971635641847	A $5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.00809489695209	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.474262170243	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.190483794663	And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work.
0.0	0.234463095899	We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...
0.0	0.295585421627	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.252559008121	Nobela (ph) is a rising entrepreneur.
0.0	0.133727534885	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.0558897791499	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.349425467807	David, there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees.
0.0	0.115721635205	It never happens.
0.0	0.299461831046	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.
0.0	0.0594877597078	I said, "Very interesting."
0.0	0.399799686319	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.237091225246	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.0580883321342	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.197682123944	And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
0.0	0.356949438664	You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
0.0	0.148696234824	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.0988931503018	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.0140193345379	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.017492061945	Okay.
0.0	0.141543292293	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.197112270195	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.0626346301451	There's a lot packed into that statement.
0.0	0.54483138897	Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.
0.0	0.210494726817	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
1.0	0.349695313075	We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.202406252309	Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
0.0	0.0825577009056	I beat China all the time.
0.0	0.354968637437	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.0969180713022	Maria, I'd just like to say...

0.0	0.283390638966	Clearly the best piece of veterans' legislation brought forth in decades.
0.0	0.284690357895	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.123809549713	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.30312846573	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.5	Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.
0.0	0.0549976111941	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.159014131801	China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.120773593812	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.36859864601	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.0775162570861	...Chris...
0.0	0.17649271538	That's the difference, and that's the kind of leader we need in the White House.
0.0	0.253065569814	You count on it.
0.0	0.507429429933	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.177073407691	Sit down with people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the house, and work on a bill.
0.0	0.164882593106	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.140889818593	They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there.
0.0	0.13054510213	You can change your mind.
0.0	0.108843437792	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.419649716519	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.109290578325	Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid.
0.0	0.0759652870114	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.0579501533445	Are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not?
0.0	0.162282179079	And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.
0.0	0.530731745829	So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating, but the highest median income in America.
0.0	0.160174377601	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.485012512853	... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.0873841422746	What are you going to do for my kids?
0.0	0.380356011213	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.234518203395	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
1.0	0.999999961542	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.0788752258026	Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down.
0.0	0.0799498545402	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.121386500503	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.0720250213765	I would prioritize them.
0.0	0.0839527468806	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.01762015373	No, you weren't.
0.0	0.408116415019	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.459360207672	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.230673264883	We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground.
0.0	0.130396616326	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.260845484592	She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.162427226163	You've got to be on top of it.
0.0	0.159096675102	So I would say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.0968572552607	We're dying.
0.0	0.274813062017	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.283459978309	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.202825384467	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.186193359958	Bill after coming home from Japan, flying 33 missions.
0.0	0.110121768215	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.338000956972	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
1.0	0.997359365065	And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money.
0.0	0.175861528723	What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria, when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family you'd better get out now.
0.0	0.112388408391	Let me just say this...
0.0	0.197558422372	And we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.
0.0	0.280532054988	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.216674521977	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.520439427325	When you ran in 2000, you said that we needed federal robust regulations.
0.0	0.648865162253	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.174391125087	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.38068944374	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.272106187231	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.333008975594	It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.
0.0	0.340713188417	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.803381037813	To get deregulated -- listen to this, they spent $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions over a 10-year period.
0.0	0.03898562101	Look, I served on...
0.0	0.181643873802	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.104105940779	Yeah (ph), no, I think that's a -- that's a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques.
0.0	0.358111449958	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.
0.0	0.116383212252	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.
0.0	0.150161568785	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?
0.0	0.130398641431	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.202026496744	I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.
0.0	0.101536059854	I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s.
0.0	0.364598093675	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.102961840462	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.606114208585	Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.
0.0	0.0601020578222	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.787963201837	By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started.
0.0	0.247656057297	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.163742197083	Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months.
0.0	0.060535818388	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
0.0	0.0798437038463	And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?
0.0	0.240313567016	So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.
0.0	0.0204132609394	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.409855015822	I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.
0.0	0.095751801001	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.0744264882407	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.438747969124	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.411603812242	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.244148230076	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.626659820192	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.0304507652909	I will...
0.0	0.0784052902131	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.224424511923	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.
0.0	0.211255336188	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.0229744480239	Thank you, Marco.
0.0	0.330009345029	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.430542015996	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.157613615668	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.250642910079	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.0217808756584	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.647251931643	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.27377407973	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
1.0	0.969824070333	Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?
0.0	0.914522006313	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.559308255303	It'll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there's no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.
0.0	0.280001269995	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.0968406352504	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.263853404505	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.818373771175	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.133731815259	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
0.0	0.679912897347	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.221409874877	We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
0.0	0.5	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.467064197194	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.208087088022	That is why we need to make police -- and I speak as a former mayor.
0.0	0.199704715957	You bet they do.
0.0	0.371597443263	I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation.
0.0	0.731720044508	And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.
0.0	0.351894294474	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.4423120201	... and we will end the illegal immigration.
0.0	0.106097526494	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.170143115718	What have you got now?
0.0	0.230726222821	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.200468226192	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.126540266315	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.221422583226	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.0834592987811	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.225311600868	Have to do it.
0.0	0.0298315543932	Here's what I'd do.
0.0	0.762524381387	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.0476438042296	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.215751559494	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.150942748376	Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process.
0.0	0.14336113097	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.125933143857	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.0445713014474	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.661305567271	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.289755580955	If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W. Bush made after 9/11 when he basically said after going to a Mosque in Washington, we are not at war with Islam or Muslims.
1.0	0.981216567323	When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.
0.0	0.0461633048588	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.184770801636	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --

0.0	0.249895800649	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...
0.0	0.539896752318	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.187803937522	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.0804284186979	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.315344223397	John, the world is a very dangerous place, but the world is not too dangerous of a place for the United States of America, provided we act according to our principles, provided we act intelligently.
0.0	0.176901277694	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.337175300991	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?

0.0	0.213911525702	You have to lead.
0.0	0.240297948796	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.0714103176221	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.0330594526005	And I'm confident we can do that.
0.0	0.266912141002	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.0880824987226	... who got us out of that...
1.0	0.534383260119	John -- John, this country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.152720999952	We actually did it.
0.0	0.750961002586	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.223836405053	Sit down with people like John Mccain.

0.0	0.219822842164	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.0934604344271	Everybody should.
0.0	0.235527583273	That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.
0.0	0.43860679064	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...

0.0	0.276293923768	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.118026248233	But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything -- everything, they got away with it again.
0.0	0.190929751214	Now, what the magic number is, I don't know, because we don't know the extent of the problem.
0.0	0.418997523679	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.
0.0	0.0441774973009	And you know what?
0.0	0.5	And I apologize to nobody for that.
1.0	0.99177832184	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.

0.0	0.243280245867	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.225311600868	And why?
0.0	0.103983230749	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.0868933395196	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.31005997432	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
0.0	0.440019321804	I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here.
0.0	0.0787608166297	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.238790089337	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.
0.0	0.224478630163	We only have one or two.
0.0	0.3003883957	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.558316624025	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.185390342216	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.169037211053	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.0137754634794	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?

0.0	0.487258809451	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.102305916416	That's what should be done.
0.0	0.14977227865	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.0144234404815	Yeah.
0.0	0.120884200254	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
0.0	0.710031427107	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
1.0	0.99999851232	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.
0.0	0.0581875375628	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.225311600868	But...
0.0	0.357357963589	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.129692708465	I can.
0.0	0.189806296543	And I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well.
0.0	0.0801272303839	And we do have to form a coalition.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.436781139198	We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be -- we ought to send our surplus.
0.0	0.255335482005	I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.054954253781	I know the good ones.
0.0	0.253730661507	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.172901202361	I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.
0.0	0.537860509898	Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage.
0.0	0.339822059888	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.173913660005	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.353417892917	By actually doing more for education.
0.0	0.0975530991792	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.0441774973009	We know...
0.0	0.165132884913	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.104303426495	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.190132835126	We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?
0.0	0.0129956816833	I like them.
0.0	0.150041290463	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.0456063423818	I gotta build those big buildings.
0.0	0.434071482392	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.361040833479	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.164621231676	You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.
0.0	0.0699572449078	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.292174968007	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
1.0	0.855876851468	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.162857425358	Well, you've got to be on top of it right away.
0.0	0.344214116041	Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.
0.0	0.254715397479	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
1.0	0.991945831242	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.417208115633	All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.
0.0	0.526573652815	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.794203778576	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.136176034031	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.12457613241	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
0.0	0.386322967019	I believe that our Federal Government needs to do more on pell grants.
0.0	0.0705278497272	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.773524906171	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.0613386042618	And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen.
0.0	0.550686146751	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.0159537942527	It feels different.
0.0	0.180457680986	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.0397091301589	I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country.
0.0	0.352605411099	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.267615398428	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.5	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.237667221497	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.270194702748	As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that.
1.0	0.483909635018	Well, we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists.
0.0	0.340237687811	They are our first line of defense.
0.0	0.554029113588	I do respect Rand.
0.0	0.309172275766	We are a better country than this.
0.0	0.365283387697	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.183676681288	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.0964582924368	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.01387031904	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.0941950959163	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.192671122894	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.374672015793	I was not the secretary of state...
0.0	0.14925533597	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.118231473604	Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.321646152143	We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.
0.0	0.53698764031	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.204919800678	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.255662848422	That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.
0.0	0.372408654858	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.217940884058	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.0780647928926	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.112254648799	They don't even have a chance.
0.0	0.225369655008	It's true.
0.0	0.249554699932	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.17182975644	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.307480775274	The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders.
0.0	0.24562189029	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.152721505926	I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.
0.0	0.0965395254538	Let me just...
0.0	0.0598408415774	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.0595808135358	Right.
0.0	0.187943470609	Yes, let's tell the truth, Martin.
0.0	0.747033494464	That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.
0.0	0.321672524338	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.335228000624	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.0395475572406	And God bless America.
0.0	0.271122547345	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.0339905510323	So they put together this.
0.0	0.0292737366259	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.127867693943	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.436708392231	We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.
0.0	0.186276903798	I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.168874271877	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
0.0	0.890634319998	We're spending over $600 billion a year on the military and yet, significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism.
0.0	0.104104159646	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.299785503304	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.356012726465	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.121168607686	Ted can change his mind.
0.0	0.623726286462	Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.
0.0	0.401837761176	I think it's fair to say that Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America, but the issue is...
0.0	0.410722433359	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.464539028386	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.139876341777	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.410197584379	First of all...
0.0	0.0908025013687	If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen.
0.0	0.281412247279	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.0249538946659	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.149912731931	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
1.0	0.97301316588	They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
0.0	0.228236162199	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.225369655008	No, it's true.
0.0	0.130474460159	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.315313964378	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.203731281107	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.971635641847	$5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.433487283469	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.285038794658	Social Security, which Republicans call a Ponzi scheme, may face privatization.
0.0	0.236976282921	But, of course, international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today.
0.0	0.16248757506	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
0.0	0.267031579121	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
1.0	0.822827770524	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
0.0	0.302452897245	This nation is the most powerful military in the world.
0.0	0.13885065426	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.209017397285	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.048120864901	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.384237365758	This is not the type of campaign that we run.
0.0	0.0868297765349	I need your help.
0.0	0.0758944709656	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.0818762812567	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.245603826096	They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn.
0.0	0.195588527789	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.32219715133	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.181049401472	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.311514042713	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.0486025401927	You're certainly not very good.
0.0	0.337298659121	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.0595808135358	All right.
0.0	0.604486214245	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.642723891983	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.0967366737866	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.152283973661	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.225311600868	No -- no...
0.0	0.5	That is some group of people.
0.0	0.536280058038	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.147825491767	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.339017472759	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.219348405852	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.335767306191	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.312758018018	The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans.
1.0	0.99474765524	ISIL videos, ISIL training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in America is at a gun show.
0.0	0.272231820435	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.0282217866261	But get this.
0.0	0.1973574938	Now, here's what is going to happen.
0.0	0.084269598637	They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it.
0.0	0.717279348657	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.0820072324496	I think we're at war with jihadists who have --
0.0	0.179516010198	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.06987427416	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.0964602681289	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.121496680946	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.15462278193	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.173702966274	I think this is a very difficult issue.
1.0	0.992350124586	It didn't say a word about legalization.
0.0	0.229416169994	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.685982771409	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.12657149591	And we have nothing.
0.0	0.617453380103	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.481064166731	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.293877757994	But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.
0.0	0.207536991899	But I agree, as I mentioned a moment ago, with King Abdullah.
0.0	0.0985307567787	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.536120417488	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.0775162570861	Chris...
0.0	0.350834549927	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.101833888568	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.151978959369	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.0766353237687	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.557194934232	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.267428142799	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.
0.0	0.0602429621113	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.257605739089	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.158087618229	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.0431599390533	It's great to be back.
0.0	0.194778767269	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.385461088082	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.327621065679	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.241524183159	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.40382199577	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.121999732394	I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here...
0.0	0.212501024586	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.374294216782	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.188250824372	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.48581093562	... funding to them.
0.0	0.235151680177	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.115479209072	Find out what I said to Greenspan.
0.0	0.440636949604	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.365221562689	For a start, they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes.
0.0	0.452239391495	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.78162360719	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.077000738047	I heard what they said.
0.0	0.176267631555	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.17025582383	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.43685442505	Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors.
0.0	0.112206314619	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.441963938006	I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.
0.0	0.434533564428	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.254806502675	But it cannot be an American fight.
0.0	0.104396312016	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.180658036382	... we will secure the border...
0.0	0.0822506543091	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.251451561159	Ever.
0.0	0.787909246766	And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.
0.0	0.14384240578	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.400770904498	We have people that aren't working.
0.0	0.126502221767	First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.251357351142	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.225311600868	These...
0.0	0.181943526013	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.304812174445	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.283114879264	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
0.0	0.0618105270324	You're right.
0.0	0.377749224061	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.294705143687	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.127217151785	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.111058404924	I will stand firm.
1.0	0.991732355843	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
0.0	0.0921101594777	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.0594886808924	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
0.0	0.104054744379	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.280010309456	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.39487031279	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.756939673905	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.0389211392852	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.227611596351	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
1.0	0.980433387603	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.21046781124	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.263481955633	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.104862389714	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.367701078155	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.52699458819	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.27956095693	How are these people gonna lead us?
0.0	0.305430069011	And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go.
0.0	0.239290469606	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.210250635248	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.193211074032	Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.
0.0	0.072069790839	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.480878833712	It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested.
0.0	0.248205205434	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.445812009655	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.378202104904	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.0567869325067	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.201479434906	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.202206473398	I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.
0.0	0.362560108417	What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.
0.0	0.140698622507	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.14392004437	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.126302632259	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.347799998757	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.0712924230048	But let's be clear.
0.0	0.137869516923	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.0866015473102	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.170473117562	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.0897137952232	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.286028214344	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.231952813345	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.228155368666	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
1.0	0.884160088462	We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.232830188081	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.276753002343	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.365871743833	Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come...
0.0	0.204189387995	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.48714292171	I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border."
0.0	0.140111683282	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
0.0	0.274363926994	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.166215236875	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.340593929849	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
1.0	0.994700047218	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.141868714484	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.228900631837	Al Qaida was based in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.129692708465	You can do both.
0.0	0.215400915391	And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition.
0.0	0.00565747236978	Look what they did in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.290217434567	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
0.0	0.384301564139	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.0561467016876	These are very, very real issues.
0.0	0.270636626465	Well, I think it's perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid.
0.0	0.148346325554	... against Islam -- radical Islam -- if you're not for border security.
0.0	0.333134971302	White people?
0.0	0.259855279033	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.0602347974729	...No, sir...
0.0	0.0651694717872	Here's what I believe.
0.0	0.0577370093983	And I think has had a big impact.
0.0	0.380477982395	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
1.0	0.980922292193	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.225311600868	...
0.0	0.0595808135358	She was right.
0.0	0.328906761455	And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians, who are also flying in that space.
0.0	0.233107981168	Now, you've got Europe.
1.0	0.0259262821547	They stole it.
0.0	0.173059085319	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.277804701073	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.230041544117	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.6843859591	And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.
0.0	0.840609829733	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.813706672153	Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble.
0.0	0.113927030276	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.0747198048138	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.467958112846	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.125230400862	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.140297929407	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.202849329467	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.216195598664	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
1.0	0.793723974254	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.177621584726	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.317272294084	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.0568797701335	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.203347920463	Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.
0.0	0.110910580095	I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.453494845	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.164983328459	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.0161890540151	They're protectionist.
1.0	0.990743577699	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.0503485586972	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.202332708458	Your prosecute criminals.
1.0	0.899853818987	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.230392076218	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.196516723665	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.120472705956	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.224956790263	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
0.0	0.558430289888	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.343419130642	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.475760950103	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.18005193725	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.206326664592	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.174372158828	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
0.0	0.225311600868	But...
0.0	0.22579289646	A military island.
1.0	0.304933431014	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.106575846913	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.156938672382	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.159726326568	So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has.
0.0	0.208518683738	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.123836811687	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.160250578695	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.391959817294	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.379026945562	So it is difficult.
0.0	0.281829744514	And the U.S. chamber of commerce, which hardly ever says nice things about Democratic governors anywhere, named our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship.
0.0	0.20957499146	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.231497857784	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.199615200992	... and I encourage everybody watching this tonight to please, acknowledge that by going online at martinomalley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism.
0.0	0.0293054346314	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.278147496897	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.112546182221	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.0595808135358	Right.
0.0	0.177072101961	And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.
0.0	0.124534217724	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.159205064645	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.39528769627	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.0678071014088	We don't win.
0.0	0.159441989644	Otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.
0.0	0.184869285044	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.251528718879	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.151439671964	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.192836778963	Revolution never came.
0.0	0.173712893247	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.0947462916491	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.40061246822	When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up.
0.0	0.537155698317	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.432030089143	Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.
0.0	0.35561286992	It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.
0.0	0.115761943374	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.0210077139861	You find me...
0.0	0.15297607904	My plan is there.
0.0	0.394258683776	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.194283492367	And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem.
0.0	0.262977967077	We need to do it now as a nation.
0.0	0.0971414782268	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.134547845815	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.117422876808	For her convenience.
0.0	0.078122013029	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.225311600868	...
1.0	0.434101815116	In 1988, I lost an election because I said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of America.
0.0	0.174047541964	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.288367634247	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.103896646632	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.282439509098	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.263956614705	We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.
0.0	0.0707992769079	There's been no crowd like this.
0.0	0.376621793896	This is absolutely absurd.
0.0	0.0582693073538	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.11429505966	That's the job.
0.0	0.846298953169	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.0805764413534	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.190954845994	Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.

0.0	0.423534624625	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.214570824253	And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.
0.0	0.264150515389	Yes, they control them.
0.0	0.628696723773	They are anxious on a number of levels.

0.0	0.0777391779301	And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.
0.0	0.139817227165	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.227893776176	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.20471027787	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.241081200384	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.0894152796499	I do and this is an important issue and I know we'll get to a lot of other critical ones as well.
0.0	0.330588783399	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.0416866075937	I gotta do it, Dad.
0.0	0.161255806887	You know, we had this incident before, Secretary, with your famous e-mails.
0.0	0.0920340341364	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.176141919068	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.225311600868	And...
0.0	0.300006139999	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.1248396251	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.192627633913	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...

0.0	0.135837585471	I learned so much.
0.0	0.314089842496	Now, on to your substantive question.

0.0	0.154743477401	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.160577424605	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.

0.0	0.103069124602	That's when we become Greece.

0.0	0.0558897791499	No problem.

0.0	0.613178850101	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.0704604475412	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.282046403481	These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy, and our economic power in alignment with our principles.
0.0	0.0973199772017	It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.
0.0	0.185924457816	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.404288112003	So, what we want to do is to say, look, we have 11 million people who have been here, many of them for decades.
0.0	0.151587692199	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.

0.0	0.157983615942	I don't think the term is what's important.
0.0	0.203708588771	Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.
0.0	0.263850540741	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.0910598658793	But what -- I will tell you this.
0.0	0.416070889008	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.289053458311	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.492019975878	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.225381133365	That's my bill.
0.0	0.447729471786	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.169330788395	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.310503135897	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.238394209076	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.20382628143	They beat us all the time.
0.0	0.127363572384	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.244330681274	And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.
0.0	0.345442077438	Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
0.0	0.107061629265	They blow people up.

0.0	0.339547149508	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.181309983907	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.291376155637	I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.
0.0	0.132122171659	We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
0.0	0.189454530478	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.196767328318	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.0595808135358	That is not right.
0.0	0.416401927891	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.937839919175	Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.
0.0	0.221969551964	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.0144234404815	Yeah.
0.0	0.258955293932	That is abundantly clear.
0.0	0.0727818776947	That's the future of banking in America.
0.0	0.391203906088	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.0595808135358	All right.
0.0	0.441129996491	We have more people in jail today than any other country on earth.
0.0	0.0507653084355	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.299726576311	It's one of the key investments we need to make.
0.0	0.644214121465	To tell Qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep.
0.0	0.128556791477	He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
0.0	0.409240258118	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.0977931243368	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.223251761544	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.
0.0	0.0831663975169	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.229296272909	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.909391741692	They make a billion dollars a day.
0.0	0.195807207778	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.343567144329	Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
0.0	0.441233997942	As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.
0.0	0.579324032923	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.270925937689	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.319533210472	A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.
0.0	0.20034655408	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.337314721136	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
0.0	0.014679347405	Sure did.
0.0	0.139543893785	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.51561242446	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.190567394776	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.343109790361	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.
0.0	0.157480741559	Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough.
0.0	0.0310716182277	I understand.
0.0	0.0767622206822	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.291632342238	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.138013127308	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.573245889913	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.187877655425	They're killing us.
1.0	0.873294592963	And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
0.0	0.319766542056	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.339672589737	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.115276690535	That's fine.
0.0	0.18430393414	We saw that in Egypt.
0.0	0.119353825819	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.0596016688121	Somebody said -- thank you, darlin'.
0.0	0.298253933563	No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.
0.0	0.255110562735	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.164021908148	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.440690569394	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.120924277847	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.279583253626	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.229229236211	And I will go back and say again, AIG was not a big bank.
0.0	0.331292809804	What would we do if this were ebola?
0.0	0.118811808144	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.328104873827	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.071254314653	He can't have it both ways.
0.0	0.0267245081323	I won't be doing that.
0.0	0.52139148044	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.484099159776	But the United States is not the policeman of the world.
0.0	0.208256483522	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.340728653422	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.304674165441	We can have debt-free college in the United States.
0.0	0.407805604152	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
0.0	0.390292358456	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.394095073326	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.139072860372	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.
0.0	0.513809367415	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.373500212125	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.38434146604	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.270320392977	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.121680136574	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.140901928529	It's called the politics.
0.0	0.358853439667	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.0828541382239	Yes, I'm getting...
0.0	0.377536030886	Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody.
0.0	0.225311600868	...
1.0	0.999991103807	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.
0.0	0.217448893631	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.0257716261387	We can't do it.
0.0	0.29039557806	This ties into campaign finance reform.
0.0	0.410197584379	First of all...
0.0	0.202289731037	I know every one.
0.0	0.196516723665	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.112331034313	But he wasn't a cheerleader.
0.0	0.0993356807215	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.0875225565763	(inaudible).
0.0	0.277740937287	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.21476122121	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.566516611412	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.296433726438	Because we need money.
0.0	0.387670532571	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.398660511072	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.425067929264	So as a nation we need to increase what we invest in Pell grants.
0.0	0.0998123415642	That is the issue.
0.0	0.277323286252	... First of all -- Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.215837227915	They've become rich.
0.0	0.269773713114	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.51428576763	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.18714262993	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.72894425541	We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations.
0.0	0.321214505268	This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.
0.0	0.0273492370129	I really am.
0.0	0.319791532725	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.225311600868	...
0.0	0.453098448044	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.0619366297508	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.5	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.

0.0	0.0509022302252	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.253914164192	Ford.

0.0	0.614748503642	I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains.
0.0	0.0922232978892	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.01762015373	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.186080348668	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.384928202139	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.0908235978814	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.187418323687	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.0600739098036	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.384046848398	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.172604434701	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.276654776007	We need to have stronger families.

0.0	0.698827393599	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.292216055747	But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.
0.0	0.261889598872	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.422790819447	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.333372218686	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.273657110322	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.399085854775	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.258168395767	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.229701960641	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.259711162462	I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks.
0.0	0.124327308412	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.233801547149	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.146811981121	And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you're a governor.
0.0	0.364852822235	And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending.
0.0	0.368275261702	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.0328413535495	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.4079143819	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.203556840103	I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria.
0.0	0.760029796997	I'm one of the 77 percent.

0.0	0.124534217724	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.0862639208142	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.110543739116	They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.
0.0	0.214809626676	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.
0.0	0.725679780352	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.

0.0	0.374538317234	He thinks low wages are a good idea.
0.0	0.724117281061	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.142092832656	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.20012178202	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.150035720075	Bottom line.

0.0	0.307462888537	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.

0.0	0.141674857845	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.390974115964	And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it.
0.0	0.172266919325	He's wrong.
0.0	0.111937184881	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.253776855267	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.912258406037	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
0.0	0.143257835944	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.816030524759	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.115532828296	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.269489630797	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.10917918858	Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy.
0.0	0.405164778095	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.0953009831496	I didn't know I had so much power.
0.0	0.656419872758	We ended up with 56 votes.
0.0	0.11832992205	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.117273757604	We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.
0.0	0.261954836053	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.136047530073	And before I say it, I have to say this.
0.0	0.329816608125	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.317358008984	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.598159853754	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.646893082614	And that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums.
0.0	0.536966353628	That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
0.0	0.0654698751309	Am I supposed to dislike them?
0.0	0.279828180048	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.19283799583	I never said that.
0.0	0.330479814548	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.165348154023	There's too much -- it's like -- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
0.0	0.261932796727	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.605728396003	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.231893111719	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
1.0	0.282639225178	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.0706147648759	No, Martha, I would not.
0.0	0.189134384936	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.144373288212	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.362623523687	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.310022070908	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.420055579812	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.
0.0	0.0790498830152	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.588696244276	... we have the tools in federal law to do this now.
0.0	0.511319594972	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.12753323118	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.209264823231	Martha -- I would just repeat that --
0.0	0.429605841709	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.186262840724	Got to go to Haiti last year.
0.0	0.157939232125	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.489287844767	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.
0.0	0.128156682456	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.34160398412	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.0754618901069	I don't think we're at war with Islam.
0.0	0.103522568895	I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.
0.0	0.27705711411	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
0.0	0.225311600868	...
0.0	0.717235996306	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
0.0	0.108492961192	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.328347622467	And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans.
1.0	0.984446175336	We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.
0.0	0.867965401451	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.363853883615	Go on to my website.
0.0	0.334215140236	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.189388899046	But he used to say, "Donald, don't go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.558785580649	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.214573272638	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.0329043244639	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.118806865182	They're not so stupid.
0.0	0.346731705741	That's the secondary issue.
0.0	0.410027258368	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.369666178804	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.
0.0	0.0840072456762	There are thing that can be done.
0.0	0.206666484823	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.227880027007	Yes.
0.0	0.147761822348	Because a lot of people said, "He'll never run.
0.0	0.275975679436	And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, "if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed.
0.0	0.0659565358688	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.122904014207	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.163089058915	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.254960482944	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.0800396642958	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.281210243677	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
0.0	0.421740221449	And we have people that are controlled by special interests.
0.0	0.868717320141	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.39606160759	So I said (ph), "No, that's the wrong number.
0.0	0.321571388918	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.83482347255	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.26321325949	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.0256448003116	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.133774416595	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.0812381835566	We have made some good progress.
0.0	0.0517525601148	And you know, he's right.
1.0	0.839409065881	And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions.
0.0	0.18108396104	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.0875225565763	Then (inaudible)...
0.0	0.525596010595	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
0.0	0.156071034046	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.687869517011	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.0280344245416	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.133760878045	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.889816070513	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.53998383025	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.0979309258352	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
0.0	0.168063219086	They are not our friend, believe me.
0.0	0.244562103985	A few days ago a similar incident happened.
0.0	0.15131998986	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.31933318278	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.380780239584	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.385800629588	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.294503087805	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.0871018945624	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.0438197025946	You're welcome.
0.0	0.895910802282	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.312985912332	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.842392540001	And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion."
0.0	0.571274200691	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.437822070861	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.121001137786	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.35405361214	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.0921251700042	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.0832591038186	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.12625636394	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.207620420319	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.257015718742	Kevin, if I could just jump in.
0.0	0.272512520667	Let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.43378161414	Now, Donald...
1.0	0.308449020365	He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage, and what its effects are.
0.0	0.408778663037	They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.
0.0	0.161009363647	Media notwithstanding.
0.0	0.338612191844	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.358268568343	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.0531885261118	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.744110803131	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
0.0	0.332441499689	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.215944308941	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.223409327891	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
0.0	0.422373356879	I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader.
1.0	0.590397215891	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.46409958283	It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military.
0.0	0.250834047643	But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."
0.0	0.579603161537	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.00949743705651	Think of it.
0.0	0.114700601522	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.291920338885	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.51970151858	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.136608177516	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.280323774476	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.713903511624	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.274766780371	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.10744419499	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.272440274327	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.314674759735	You have all of these disastrous airports.
0.0	0.225517531142	He couldn't answer the question.
0.0	0.440862888589	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.264830468892	It's affordable for everybody.
0.0	0.121927776894	You can't do it with empty promised.
1.0	0.970669008749	Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.
0.0	0.162267310397	I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.
1.0	0.937854981708	Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.
0.0	0.41849770007	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.365601306413	... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.144632749934	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
0.0	0.57306164913	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.34023262888	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.198453940108	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.983894217234	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.0175996584532	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.109650806923	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.401402445083	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.307298866233	That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities.
0.0	0.246346295463	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.328939708805	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.0853222708045	Well, I think it's pretty clear that they know that I will.
0.0	0.162863565166	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.260654663973	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.341448815113	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.442663537967	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.262344881876	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.0439727139432	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.026465070492	And it isn't because I'm all that great.
0.0	0.0498604403699	And we're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.352283194991	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.14466969796	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.400919523	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.115721635205	It never happens.
0.0	0.115014623229	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.15517786469	Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take.
0.0	0.973961026645	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
1.0	0.841761965552	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
0.0	0.225311600868	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.580524894598	The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress.
0.0	0.139572545938	They're a scam.
0.0	0.321981600241	Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity.
0.0	0.442465303322	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.372034195747	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.
0.0	0.61617306482	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.0970068533406	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.349615030766	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.0750519089716	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.287271406492	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.199384995698	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.31817843822	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.199301665741	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.239128548266	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.195299023317	The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.
0.0	0.105661230328	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.0860834333434	Can you believe this?
0.0	0.0614927800922	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.44543621911	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.920267630586	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.491078322711	When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish Glass-Stegall.
0.0	0.172761884593	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.356150558369	But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.
0.0	0.110811611093	That is the clear and present danger.
0.0	0.215682050718	Our vets are being treated horribly.

0.0	0.280162350433	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.22629876132	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.360740141431	So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.

0.0	0.844196932324	Illegal.
0.0	0.180243918057	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.379423835845	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.5	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.226648837302	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
0.0	0.212912757028	He hit oil.
0.0	0.0676027255573	So we have work to do.

0.0	0.110835601048	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.0617925060895	And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party, but of President Obama.
0.0	0.18534506383	And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?
1.0	0.937296028032	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.100660797974	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.131624969701	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.0338741648725	Marco, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.173241683126	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.0117865331028	Oh.
0.0	0.0431190057293	I don't want it."

0.0	0.0316866170688	That is why we need to make...

0.0	0.0561741198525	I tell you that.
0.0	0.211817515229	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.

0.0	0.0852096344769	Yes, I agree.

0.0	0.448583264736	I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.
0.0	0.0512120484775	You really can't.
0.0	0.290175501912	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?

0.0	0.0834546942867	Not bad.
0.0	0.0632476380694	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.39947691734	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.77526003105	We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government.
0.0	0.0784876621276	And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.
0.0	0.132419733973	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.

0.0	0.170639908801	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.138515379983	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.320722654667	I've had had two town halls, one in Keene, one in Laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do.
0.0	0.378194095608	They're going to take away thousands of jobs.
0.0	0.095703433478	Folks, it's not too late.
1.0	0.926420288173	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.

0.0	0.440873202715	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.337300365295	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.519177971622	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.115154946642	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
0.0	0.0349880842227	It's a joke.

0.0	0.231459922899	You know why three?
0.0	0.196704071697	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.

0.0	0.442622954537	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.283106054492	And for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.
0.0	0.691453845862	You should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition.
0.0	0.220753142038	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.323482800015	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.393602028185	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.112388408391	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.537302760954	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.0915342892402	I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination.
0.0	0.107856838753	We don't have victories anymore.

0.0	0.0968572552607	We're dying.
0.0	0.0418578556372	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.0584982701668	I think I am a nice person.
0.0	0.232679468097	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.491505436644	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.308587780385	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.0402392067416	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.0372864506206	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.203111820487	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.0386245519697	OK, good.
0.0	0.167878874717	He'll say, "Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico."
0.0	0.139592173187	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.258809327041	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.146396155455	People that know me, like me.
0.0	0.0905255316837	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.435903768367	We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we're not going to hand out citizenship cards, either.
0.0	0.396207165675	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.391063536355	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.429649633798	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
1.0	0.71704997777	Today, we have about 4,000.
0.0	0.225259748523	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.511151535052	She's the senator from New York.
0.0	0.506467719854	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.01762015373	You don't have to.
0.0	0.17245009983	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.565264246215	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.658093449247	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.026337111616	I have no idea.
0.0	0.232640045069	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.432855657545	Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes.
0.0	0.206479840074	Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.
0.0	0.134981473055	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.0081225638333	How would we act?
0.0	0.0774859326525	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.0273853805674	Break them up.

0.0	0.293491456634	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.142168364652	The business model of Wall Street is fraud.
0.0	0.20846368737	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.185473948748	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.51225305404	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.141699707643	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.529418096728	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.0266887203441	Look at my family.
0.0	0.0737302302774	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.275563657593	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.862240991706	Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.
0.0	0.190732901743	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.13274942857	... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message.
0.0	0.40291232973	And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina, and many other Republican states, that because of their right wing political ideology, are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.227880027007	Yes.
0.0	0.226567958471	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.226816340381	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.

0.0	0.0182489906449	OK...
0.0	0.257229547706	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
1.0	0.826918680912	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.

0.0	0.108154158548	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.589626110536	Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.
0.0	0.356320569618	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.0595808135358	That's right.
1.0	0.982971841738	Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.159972601933	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.187571925996	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.165176332892	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.295925733372	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.468521488361	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.358554124492	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.185122828047	... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region.
0.0	0.15286193379	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.291275594045	And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before.
0.0	0.0167456410125	I love the Saudis.
0.0	0.0971379885768	Wall Street today has too much political power.
1.0	0.970463969886	They were wrong.
0.0	0.245781340804	So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.
0.0	0.4727726955	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.229966689917	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.282619476175	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.233780868592	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.343889303347	The endorsements that I'm proud of are conservative leaders like Dr. James Dobson, and over 700,000 contributions nationwide, people going to our Web site, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.124556792751	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.210748188075	Because you realize that people depending on you.
0.0	0.46564750917	I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
0.0	0.0600955870051	That's not fair.
0.0	0.286042559545	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
0.0	0.399967746675	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.2149480636	I think we all support that.
0.0	0.17734816552	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.162931698083	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
1.0	0.111934404721	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.335288812221	On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center.
0.0	0.479728879602	We can triple the border patrol.
0.0	0.471551952311	And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.27549378159	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.287689605514	Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.
0.0	0.111681228578	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.385892341322	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.1222614286	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.652308446135	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.107521242495	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.370027184553	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.232482211781	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.102944536031	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.318653497683	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.328110033242	The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.
0.0	0.169448633787	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.340828396378	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.358888829244	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.123090793302	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
0.0	0.161607192404	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.105886049451	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.29013405058	We will see what the American people are willing to support.
0.0	0.213884215285	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.
0.0	0.389602655103	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.444935678677	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.299396796779	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.147074546199	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.249703638178	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
0.0	0.396253816496	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.166126963419	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.0182489906449	OK.
0.0	0.33757675988	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.0441774973009	And you know what?
0.0	0.318133477055	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.142686401753	And some, I assume, are good people.
0.0	0.0725986400506	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.175854561977	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.0569122518087	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.101850825315	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.0759799054135	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.248213514393	I am advocating...
0.0	0.166003552798	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.0911465436726	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.17509862487	That's a hard road to walk.
0.0	0.5	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
1.0	0.974881935067	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
0.0	0.420440866104	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.174315403655	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.807082395606	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.389708289291	They started in Iowa.
0.0	0.387062635478	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.5	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.102635002028	I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.
0.0	0.451598296005	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
0.0	0.072219710211	We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is.
0.0	0.137885142817	The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.
0.0	0.144304856957	And I -- I thought, if I didn't jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this.
0.0	0.180103982252	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.456572486175	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.238651457932	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.307424341626	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
1.0	0.214906987332	They cite Obamacare.
1.0	0.918752590663	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
0.0	0.316119443169	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
0.0	0.123177771608	You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well.
0.0	0.0726479195972	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.196556777396	I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.354355843522	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
0.0	0.328098029961	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.857857888773	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.

0.0	0.190405106321	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.187911233934	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.

0.0	0.352696910546	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.462976025442	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
1.0	0.999990529005	The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation.
0.0	0.225311600868	It is.
0.0	0.0907237339664	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.

0.0	0.279379450384	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.562604417676	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.833403071392	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.558195839129	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
0.0	0.0838918144423	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.214943966294	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.302998860694	Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.

0.0	0.0645036675147	... and I'd like to respond.
0.0	0.0494003750242	That's kind of a no-brainer.
0.0	0.153998571575	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.490755703785	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.169977878613	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.19283799583	I never said that.
0.0	0.236999892033	At the same time we're doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform.
0.0	0.374689833657	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.354110795741	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.107792650705	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.144056782903	And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016.
0.0	0.0764351758845	Now I'm not doing that...I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?
0.0	0.0126120068636	And guess what?
0.0	0.802026892869	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.352828871808	The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.

0.0	0.27685241198	I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization.
0.0	0.175612687155	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.224712585499	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.52533709121	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.469292946024	I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.796861977632	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.
0.0	0.316395708274	Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.

0.0	0.100684121484	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.373620649244	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.413234790964	I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.
0.0	0.209829397737	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.0707003801966	He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots.
0.0	0.439948367947	Now, you'd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me?
0.0	0.139844778189	Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.
0.0	0.592371037565	Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers.
1.0	0.103107445573	It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.374933553899	Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?
0.0	0.161336560353	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
0.0	0.0650654308812	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.456070105962	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.159634071839	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.0713491246051	I believe we've got to go further.
0.0	0.38434146604	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.68350681561	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.240953581886	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.225577436456	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.17041651859	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.937488284987	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.101078656739	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.52750439832	But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.
0.0	0.0557246445103	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.250797933359	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.742784508911	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.384602874257	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.0595808135358	Right?
0.0	0.219138687948	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
0.0	0.0605510158661	As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe.
0.0	0.0794718878154	I don't have to brag.
0.0	0.386903517451	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.13711437793	I love Donald Trump.
1.0	0.348767801639	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.166642314806	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.188137182153	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.678515007562	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.0712868395833	There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.
0.0	0.0445070304375	Came out great.
0.0	0.124836246442	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.0504179176689	How has it worked?
0.0	0.379651403321	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.0181767321095	Oh, great.
0.0	0.252771853849	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.564769482492	It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.263638671503	Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said.
0.0	0.264202578418	And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.
0.0	0.2063131752	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
0.0	0.196737164843	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.188845011452	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.966874524782	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.203469035196	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.160587569774	I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.
0.0	0.485442877691	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
1.0	0.856678427166	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
1.0	0.137350711568	They're bringing crime.
0.0	0.606717318473	Secretary Clinton also said we -- it was not just the invasion of Iraq which Secretary Clinton voted for and has since said was a big mistake -- and, indeed, it was.
0.0	0.222438079586	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.571262368492	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.106125019755	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.074924225232	You know, this is not easy work.
0.0	0.433461571576	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.0904553481027	We needed 60.
0.0	0.193232571126	Go ahead.
0.0	0.106281822412	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.159090681184	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.225038938716	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.300440722128	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.716035804213	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.0309981776073	I got that.
0.0	0.133587740136	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.229196691897	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.0144234404815	Yeah.
0.0	0.0626917563261	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.402729561336	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.144790639023	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.
0.0	0.147616053726	Our healthcare is a horror show.
1.0	0.8846284312	The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.
0.0	0.180337945548	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.445040067125	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.187324899227	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.4224449222	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.21795187867	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.44021537789	And second of all...
0.0	0.095578108974	And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.
0.0	0.513859977976	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.151827832607	Everybody thought the deal was dead.
0.0	0.0827157230942	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.0256415694622	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.17870722309	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.312669888975	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.167247924791	But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
0.0	0.14353460679	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.421996435764	And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and I would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go.
1.0	0.709447175376	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.230788610779	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.
0.0	0.545105137591	Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.
0.0	0.166530365594	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.189753910673	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.158340782772	Can I -- can I -- I just...
0.0	0.110718566725	Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."
0.0	0.5	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.195536774527	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
0.0	0.182162446389	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.644835542026	What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.11776179028	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.176296797216	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.307365582469	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.0475375774998	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.5	We actually passed a living wage.
0.0	0.372277898279	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.112961768939	Now I want to go back something.
0.0	0.362742966358	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
0.0	0.279724059605	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.198694170198	Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.
0.0	0.576057937606	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.268248712205	But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.
0.0	0.289199096971	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.356068012546	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.0514838246012	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.0509503058259	So, so important.
0.0	0.340679228804	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.100341187648	You have a bigger problem with China.
0.0	0.29885877134	And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.
0.0	0.219760559676	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.342214488079	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.637733971647	I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.
0.0	0.232805283834	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.252184253917	The central question in this race is trust.
0.0	0.812338149226	And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.114619256648	I made it when I ran in 2008.
0.0	0.151516360139	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
1.0	0.9920129193	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.312606634292	And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation.
0.0	0.400717155964	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.735084676686	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.426993293453	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.0620863853796	I don't care.
0.0	0.104299124683	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.309571501888	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
0.0	0.32197901659	In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.
0.0	0.252659356733	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.180526118107	That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable.
0.0	0.159864189527	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.281792941561	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.570719467017	What part is valid?
0.0	0.223120502106	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.
0.0	0.287972755614	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.

0.0	0.399898677441	They like to ask direct questions.
0.0	0.172266919325	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.294717682954	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.133603368791	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.653990176437	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.225311600868	...
0.0	0.228854694832	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.

0.0	0.307384927972	I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
0.0	0.155278242042	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.0307372975663	And I hear their speeches.
0.0	0.583455531089	It's campaign -- a corrupt campaign finance system.
0.0	0.0433170142368	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.22118573915	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.225310481892	Bigger than that?
0.0	0.121479070561	But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go.
0.0	0.0167830927211	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.00108268351422	Look--
0.0	0.150031353552	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.225311600868	No.
0.0	0.179305201042	We are at war with violent extremism.
0.0	0.108158073126	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.908176836004	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.304973141093	How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years.
0.0	0.598918671051	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.208664088273	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.197928944606	There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
0.0	0.330247178209	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.296881352979	Nobody.
0.0	0.154656323486	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.039902549619	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.0402979084921	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.203249474253	Against the Republican leadership, who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies.
0.0	0.0431985047929	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.373036777495	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.
1.0	0.95188552322	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.31738650284	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.153614819383	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.171835864764	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.0216020942599	That's what our parents and grandparents always did.
0.0	0.127762804714	But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble.
0.0	0.472462528877	When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.
0.0	0.148247228163	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.247745860099	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.258157032284	Making fun of disabled people...
0.0	0.320886206204	Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.
0.0	0.169388878449	They are not going to go away on their own.
0.0	0.268301795235	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.29842065579	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.328036473882	We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.
0.0	0.422053680789	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.20665443783	This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.
0.0	0.169803644853	We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.
0.0	0.434185359736	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.304732569083	You cannot grant amnesty.
0.0	0.287873310505	And, of course, I met the mothers of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, and Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and so many of them who have lost their children.
0.0	0.402930976668	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.149443601298	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.0595808135358	All right.
0.0	0.321418146169	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.236449846715	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.537371390118	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.
0.0	0.151619409582	But states need to do more as well.
0.0	0.0455532797408	I do not think it would come to that.
0.0	0.0282217866261	We get Bergdahl.
0.0	0.109630476046	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.
0.0	0.0108486559177	It's not great again.
0.0	0.227880027007	Yes.
0.0	0.171461914102	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.594081228924	Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons -- three out of four people in prison are black or brown.
0.0	0.104162410602	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.0919230494603	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.14166727838	... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street.
0.0	0.06889054238	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.573300725149	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.0995905802416	Afghanistan is a mess.
0.0	0.156811368762	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.493709042295	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.388906042522	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.00423295260202	I feel like...
0.0	0.301714976542	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.267879147232	Got to be on the floor of the Senate.
0.0	0.20214128273	I've done an amazing job.
0.0	0.418825922413	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.693762593529	As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.157250967886	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.265336794086	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.560451868371	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.300995569007	In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America.
0.0	0.481279047171	And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring.
0.0	0.0892759326796	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.236701399571	And we have to do more to prevent the flood of foreign fighters that have gone to Syria, especially the ones with western passports, that come back.
0.0	0.210752124768	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
1.0	0.999986900998	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.294877633497	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.0260628185919	That's what really matters.
0.0	0.0136367385857	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.5	We have a corrupt campaign finance system dominated by Super PACs.
0.0	0.176396650416	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.268143215919	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.470356925476	And together we make it possible for a new generation of young people to refinance their debt and not come out with debt in the future.
0.0	0.314137547418	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.12114875712	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.15358411804	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.146227087149	I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail.
0.0	0.12391686127	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.547379291194	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.122399962443	John, may I -- may I interject here?
0.0	0.102213172453	I'm going to be independent.
0.0	0.0504179176689	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.284885377181	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.494539128507	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.384865631576	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.248243583355	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.522750176329	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.014679347405	That's for sure.
0.0	0.848738951443	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.254309666691	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.548151999523	Since, you know, the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody.
0.0	0.231983048412	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.185622864766	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.0422679927627	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.900335706236	We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.
0.0	0.145690587391	I don't think a halt is necessary.
1.0	0.951891135683	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.263966341893	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.06987427416	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.530367089379	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.274780057	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.250300611466	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.365827992438	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
0.0	0.335909875885	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
0.0	0.0292737366259	That's good.
0.0	0.236547840303	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.158678852038	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.
0.0	0.0651694717872	Believe me.
0.0	0.0671258018045	He's not a leader.
0.0	0.528143479719	It was an investment bank.
0.0	0.225311600868	No.
0.0	0.528093557063	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.0925525096557	Neil...
0.0	0.436238802765	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
1.0	0.999986950322	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.373215781103	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.0388059719934	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.336637186109	As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.
0.0	0.221011218348	And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.
0.0	0.0730298254795	Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
0.0	0.0890498683952	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
1.0	0.999987578487	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.0015932724082	Reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.36265330492	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.287813508732	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.0184354813757	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.225311600868	What do we do?
0.0	0.115902111263	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.0958894797301	Believe me, folks.
0.0	0.122666124349	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
1.0	0.458107990308	However, what Alan Krueger said in the piece you're referring to is that if we went to $15, there are no international comparisons.
0.0	0.303650950356	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.25869738203	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.134631245687	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.169775577022	They will be our early warning signal.
0.0	0.444390238094	Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.
1.0	0.993470315412	Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world.
0.0	0.553654753341	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.156552104733	Yes, we must protect our borders.
0.0	0.24059287276	And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.
0.0	0.225311600868	No.
0.0	0.56834338415	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.0441774973009	But you know what?
0.0	0.11128523587	Well, thank you, John.
0.0	0.5	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.130528741485	Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.
0.0	0.175758171994	And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.
0.0	0.100685612917	My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.
0.0	0.0966862231347	Becky --
0.0	0.429038285609	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.620720102553	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.121072856427	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.565460474501	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.206160366939	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.085832777176	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.178615477519	So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly.
0.0	0.101215918031	I will work my heart out.
0.0	0.0953322810264	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.5	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.76239369149	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.0129956816833	I like that.
0.0	0.276301593381	First priority, destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.149694844671	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.0371023034035	... issues they have to respond to.
0.0	0.203504203823	And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.156010579279	Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
0.0	0.663804664773	We can end welfare for those here illegally.
0.0	0.206723156375	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.108380888845	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.343228323717	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.
0.0	0.210026888846	And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?
0.0	0.291696429428	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.

0.0	0.177326247739	Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.
0.0	0.210101767063	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.227880027007	Yes.
0.0	0.0506522641685	And they wanted to make sure it got built.

0.0	0.254492866523	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.464642312985	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.346928948217	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.699291303693	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.247565131244	We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States.
0.0	0.24093236496	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.15376311226	I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.
0.0	0.393879661568	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.367472545278	It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.
0.0	0.434677895475	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.0917415357333	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.187404263606	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.

0.0	0.127656590544	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.238783975273	They come up to my office.
0.0	0.34476892017	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.203123907227	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.57827460668	... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.603847555243	More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows.
0.0	0.5	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.220763725925	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.177635700797	I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
0.0	0.19194680806	I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.
0.0	0.19715562674	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.
0.0	0.081423953006	Thank you, John.
0.0	0.321250952523	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.317736997953	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.200206282829	And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't."
0.0	0.0348261096155	He was a great negotiator.
0.0	0.274842312632	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.0772227710782	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.104015127077	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.146809185317	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.394268905686	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.448319650202	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.115854469331	And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a -- that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.
0.0	0.0284113184426	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.394662571332	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.136675213657	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.
0.0	0.136740787919	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.015836608064	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.0712924230048	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.62129647688	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.192565773014	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.02466260338	I hate to hear it."
0.0	0.369089102339	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.233309286796	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.225311600868	So did you.
0.0	0.31331257408	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.114506467132	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.726552594768	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.296631898741	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.0441774973009	And how do I know it?
1.0	0.999999999982	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.229062398193	I want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, which they have not been doing.

0.0	0.5	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.0940378986014	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.183662409029	And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears.
0.0	0.15420462588	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.150035720075	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.225311600868	But what...
0.0	0.486318510441	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
0.0	0.102021251918	Check it out.
0.0	0.10552986405	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.530151165914	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.494161892976	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.0524319234813	Here's the story.
0.0	0.182498159501	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.
0.0	0.520836363138	It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.
0.0	0.246242163719	First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.
0.0	0.100206869907	So it was not against ISIS, it was against -- it was against Assad.
0.0	0.149228262815	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.0142317133157	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.208859359437	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.225311600868	You did.
0.0	0.133993077099	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.510448986523	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.334770311865	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.216639182131	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.200977542122	We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it.
0.0	0.0441774973009	But you know what?
0.0	0.375982830011	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.0308970814597	Maria...
0.0	0.263806112679	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.210305093061	You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.
0.0	0.313771586954	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.176082233345	There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out.
0.0	0.184310087242	They can provide forces.
0.0	0.0870056669438	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.0144234404815	Yeah.
0.0	0.110807184783	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.184224856925	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.285805869067	And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.
0.0	0.194637532604	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.
0.0	0.307592673824	Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
0.0	0.205540813146	Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.
0.0	0.0704604475412	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.349510577936	Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values.
0.0	0.225311600868	That is what we have to do.
1.0	0.917237150876	And I have assets -- big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected -- 9 billion 240 million dollars.
0.0	0.285413574757	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.0306289783466	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.265135147023	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.0859171963457	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.0558897791499	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.447205675576	Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.130010728968	... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.
0.0	0.0634398583163	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.629753313353	In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, "what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"
0.0	0.0888029436139	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.0921183215959	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.106993054512	They sweated like dogs.
0.0	0.0182489906449	OK?
0.0	0.144557398287	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.398403383573	But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.
0.0	0.225720144004	I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.043029084503	Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.
0.0	0.173510651668	Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem.
0.0	0.479125835327	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.238620086714	We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America.
0.0	0.232804754862	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.443118346977	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.0332758795867	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.178168134233	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.261330979621	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.164167398939	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.200906187913	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.883275666536	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.16941363803	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.174334448196	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.384980710172	She said the truth.
0.0	0.338234562116	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.222859632989	We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
0.0	0.334446826133	And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.
0.0	0.249428162262	Ninety-three hours.
0.0	0.203981444917	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.
0.0	0.220934931442	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.163950965728	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.128763853649	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.396487043932	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.428867942685	That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.0965395254538	Let me just -- let me just...
0.0	0.216134641718	Like, I'm standing here, I -- I watched the video of Senator Cruz.
0.0	0.0644920140712	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.303351183426	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.333357501113	The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.313157192547	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
0.0	0.104210097561	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.200043734876	From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made.
0.0	0.155933890903	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.124449729471	On welfare.
0.0	0.3359120906	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.3136618373	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.110932053237	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.196348413248	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.0357209493076	...the only reason is -- look...
0.0	0.391899696019	She's an American citizen.
0.0	0.3756112045	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.0700753437281	We will be there soon.
0.0	0.229556822738	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.203838047353	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.512577379612	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.185668672418	I -- I believe that we should make community college free.
0.0	0.730161654213	Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.
0.0	0.0830124681878	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.633109787293	Number one...
0.0	0.13992012011	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.226036587425	You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.
0.0	0.365721671886	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.
0.0	0.16329551957	In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston.
0.0	0.527833052865	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.
0.0	0.149376148365	I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.
0.0	0.826918680912	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.115221900905	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.163553458775	And I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate.
0.0	0.314703094537	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
0.0	0.32304441547	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.0919978218396	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.61963279011	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.562182609502	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.25164591714	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
0.0	0.566831824672	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.109857561283	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
0.0	0.29484699467	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.073039487762	He said, "I can't get it into China.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.195493815416	The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.
0.0	0.0144310892772	They're off to China.
0.0	0.00700318505323	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.283292641605	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.0970532362673	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.331112590976	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.385939748647	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.149616347217	It's coming from more than Mexico.
0.0	0.0817761958385	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.0998724641529	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.152079466357	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.520328115974	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.268390740069	Yes, exactly, exactly.
0.0	0.0425456748935	I don't think it's gonna happen.
0.0	0.0956963741949	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.0715113749615	I'm going to tell you -- thank you.
0.0	0.0917389578184	We can't even go there.
0.0	0.285554522467	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.248523517826	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.156074015098	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.371089641098	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
1.0	0.740094375294	In fact, wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century, after my husband's administration.
0.0	0.0168714016466	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.637062819325	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.0323137080829	They're not good.
0.0	0.419358136513	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.644723128417	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.933626503559	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.42623044812	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.19686128995	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.146108289914	Good at email.
0.0	0.0798076542635	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.118831269017	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.236941257589	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.225674881283	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.
0.0	0.418189521723	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.152044859368	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.173607235856	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.263930946758	We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0206759675869	It's not crass.
0.0	0.0736225608673	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.152720999952	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.271499747836	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.149075407602	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.928294079419	Real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years.
0.0	0.180524759451	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.216365691999	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.427235582466	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.600290214941	We have a stock market that is so bloated.
0.0	0.138067939645	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.5	The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.
0.0	0.276258110867	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.13301817631	I'm meeting with three of them in the next week.
0.0	0.0363992408909	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.0477425905519	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.0858214789491	We don't need more of the same solutions.
0.0	0.346757156406	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.198293430748	They're building up their military to a point that is very scary.
0.0	0.136047530073	Say again?
0.0	0.264772365374	They;re gone.
0.0	0.258658498585	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
1.0	0.876725008369	That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.
0.0	0.0872760681436	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.528066820601	I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
0.0	0.11185167411	I was there and I saw the debate.
0.0	0.409114034401	And it requires an entire world to come together, including in a very active way, the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.0349404552878	I'm getting to that.
0.0	0.0862639208142	Don't believe it.
0.0	0.0195565657592	Talk about what?
0.0	0.195089148374	I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries.
0.0	0.121254482491	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.0970475966172	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.529092636817	I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of State, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now.
0.0	0.290150099425	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.222373617919	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.
0.0	0.0353707144551	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.905540522726	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.67382690471	And that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity -- kill people who are unarmed who should not be killed, they must be held accountable.
0.0	0.188986030947	We're running.
0.0	0.225311600868	How do we do it?"
0.0	0.360222393685	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.041655976339	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.51510256124	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.466199929064	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.00424271834487	No vision at all.
0.0	0.0953397809444	I used the tithing analogy.
1.0	0.386213291921	We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
0.0	0.0628309732897	And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.
0.0	0.1152047847	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.246918422002	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
1.0	0.934122882917	I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.
0.0	0.129036885221	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.575642471192	She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.711683901849	We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.
0.0	0.524270069482	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.363626507655	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.370001526577	You read about all the companies now that are doing business -- about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on.
0.0	0.202858667093	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.256344804688	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
0.0	0.917603218886	You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56 percent, equivalent to 56 percent of the GDP In America.
0.0	0.395564120114	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
1.0	0.66264841375	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty, and we're the only country in the world -- virtually the only country that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.1743362915	I would just...
0.0	0.0186767701484	Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.
0.0	0.0104869138779	So be very, very careful.
0.0	0.251178843829	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.01762015373	I didn't.
0.0	0.085832777176	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.404414597343	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.374163598835	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.572823564509	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.235932165341	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.313189437843	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.131978793408	Absolutely.
0.0	0.0682978196176	But you know what else they're anxious about?
0.0	0.511963357539	And I was determined to do everything that I could to make VA health care the best in the world, to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending.
0.0	0.152834302835	So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.
0.0	0.127300215853	How stupid are they?
0.0	0.186003486521	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.24980491289	I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones.
0.0	0.222910037911	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.225311600868	What do we do?
0.0	0.0441774973009	And you know what?
0.0	0.228500815108	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.258654548536	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.442856992428	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.576111129593	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.41661042037	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.0988057399337	She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.
1.0	0.00786567381354	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.464462118922	The first vote hasn't been counted.
0.0	0.105403522984	I mean, that's a fact.
0.0	0.173372388435	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.142417410453	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.551191510344	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.126639736492	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.0135423152395	I love China.
0.0	0.474588023078	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.318117034375	So, yes, I did know people.
0.0	0.238280000954	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.530042324678	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.225311600868	But Megyn...
0.0	0.0595808135358	That's not right.
0.0	0.0783839534218	That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.
0.0	0.397407588041	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.401646345931	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.292614174693	I've prosecuted terrorists.
0.0	0.0282809955304	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.120533250531	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.281132309777	I'm not using donors.
0.0	0.159817199342	I think after 11 hours, that's pretty clear, yes.
0.0	0.106161358607	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.220291065391	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.0229449901929	I hope those are the issues we'll discuss.
1.0	0.382672464555	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.0670935778568	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.280791156524	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.256412076255	It cannot be contained, it must be defeated.
0.0	0.196699971961	There are no simple solutions.
0.0	0.261704366683	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.44131420844	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.598500679583	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.20861310488	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
1.0	0.926638663533	In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.
0.0	0.149784566113	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.225311600868	Both.
0.0	0.413600826058	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.312813651936	I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
0.0	0.665421967858	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.38317380093	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.360257138847	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.332001181872	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.347917869017	Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region.
0.0	0.687879607507	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.223890017628	... What was your question...
0.0	0.225311600868	So what do we do?
0.0	0.336165336928	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.225311600868	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.20820458287	He undermines it.
0.0	0.157427175389	They have children who are doing so well, I've met and worked with dreamers.
0.0	0.41113261248	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
0.0	0.252043139711	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.104563189745	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.
0.0	0.0726949687378	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.173360582928	Obama is going to be out playing golf.
1.0	0.322805182891	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.267785685129	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.800925013422	Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system.
0.0	0.167904534449	You've got to go the extra mile.
0.0	0.198292314419	And your point is absolutely well taken.
0.0	0.443751900653	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.245013959324	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.161208151723	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.0891720430103	I said, "I don't know."
0.0	0.916707691299	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.614566892602	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.236606824663	And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting.
0.0	0.366162466713	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.175578016825	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.116410132233	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.141751276072	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.0412164791685	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.129209139907	We have the U.N. Security Council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path.
0.0	0.143380983805	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.179062834834	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.602514663256	They're controlled fully -- they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
1.0	0.266640358054	They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us.
0.0	0.633004197559	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
0.0	0.101722897328	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.0692258403438	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.399218120507	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.
0.0	0.183642651146	So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.
0.0	0.5	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.608487442402	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.139087265038	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.0895767322759	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.282837476234	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.221088109075	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.27218758075	The people don't work for us.
0.0	0.240525162578	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.225311600868	We have to do it.
0.0	0.303654293139	My daughters went to college on a mountain of bills.
0.0	0.168342719926	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.5	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.11850153662	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.0328399454329	And he'll say, "Please, please, please."
0.0	0.227880027007	Yes.
1.0	0.33432401466	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.401019994336	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.147116421674	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.248667063292	We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up.
0.0	0.0279002800098	But I learned a lot.
0.0	0.0863997704444	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.394119176553	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.226260163038	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.12393901463	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.658273644765	I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.
0.0	0.0900509330544	It is a tragedy all over this country.
0.0	0.294938747836	Number two, we had a really good plan.
0.0	0.124136010389	We're ready to start shooting."
0.0	0.131978793408	Absolutely.
0.0	0.279914174093	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.134776611258	And I think that's the false choice...
0.0	0.153878110659	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.135775451067	Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk.
0.0	0.217121144	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.348516671824	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.134425558021	John?
0.0	0.229933431885	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
1.0	0.999999972338	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.448859157703	Never support.
0.0	0.235744913099	We are already de-conflicting air space.
0.0	0.135391500372	That's because we've put conservative policies in place.
0.0	0.571634063805	You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.125515254213	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.108305151665	You're simply not.
0.0	0.302303847319	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.487196569338	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
0.0	0.0441774973009	You know why?
0.0	0.529381756126	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.4511624201	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.206552474686	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.191557961824	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.0695860874165	Marco can change his mind.
0.0	0.400524039621	Well, I'm kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time.
0.0	0.0978944700487	They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).
0.0	0.168770512321	Could I just say -- just say this...
0.0	0.425364537593	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
0.0	0.244625255938	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.0108486559177	How great is that?
0.0	0.732661065306	Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.
0.0	0.226319226626	It's become more complicated.
0.0	0.229445742538	I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support.
0.0	0.52901457125	It means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana.
0.0	0.221346221203	I disagree with free college for everybody.
1.0	0.978405668231	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.118723843803	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
0.0	0.217013122503	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.23039315934	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.240064137763	At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida.
0.0	0.227880027007	Yes.
0.0	0.25564903583	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.485556873277	And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.
0.0	0.333283098979	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.0889069203172	People say, "Oh, you don't like China?"
0.0	0.0429531693814	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.426294548952	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.0292737366259	Not good.
0.0	0.390206763819	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
0.0	0.0425876972034	They're a great family.
0.0	0.126142200032	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.388106745571	When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.429035890872	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.566131048453	We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq.
0.0	0.0942100013774	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.175771991784	But here's the real key.
1.0	0.98210150304	They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.
0.0	0.0578967334939	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.5	But here, a total net worth of -- net worth, not assets, not -- a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets -- Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York -- many other places all over the world.
0.0	0.281403492288	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.366028355079	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.338862815477	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.0863233519942	That would be a disaster for this country.
0.0	0.197079715704	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.204478709579	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.0495353777342	I would change them.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.399486674362	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.
0.0	0.0307832093314	We are not France.
0.0	0.261256755011	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.0927530245894	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.640784763277	It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English.
0.0	0.144364401463	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.248473318483	And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.
0.0	0.162222008108	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.138778053188	What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy, and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need.
0.0	0.569479146313	States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government.
0.0	0.207207548964	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.186890643863	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.216827321729	It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state.
0.0	0.5	In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men.
0.0	0.335896163017	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.166036484074	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.260858331161	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.157861735205	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0162494654939	I happen to think...
0.0	0.414800005772	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.450124884684	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.154616350028	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
0.0	0.127924995421	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.0144234404815	Yeah.
0.0	0.141753693596	... ground and air.
0.0	0.225311600868	Why is it...
0.0	0.240854269634	And that's what we have= representing us.
1.0	0.959590636166	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.222175207893	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.175644376449	We are doing both at the same time.
0.0	0.305248534866	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.102419769825	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.131904788404	Nothing's gonna get done.
0.0	0.0567572803897	I want a job."
0.0	0.193786642193	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.679877033527	But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
0.0	0.647977127797	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
0.0	0.763150454603	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.0989915633127	And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.
0.0	0.144054425959	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.399033318613	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.0278778120081	You get together.
1.0	0.665506400805	Nancy, the blueprint in Maryland that we followed was yes, we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment.
0.0	0.250324959752	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.662334253741	Drugs have taken far too many of our citizens.
0.0	0.228133646738	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.64871909792	But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
0.0	0.146436123606	May I respond?
0.0	0.0466777502376	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.0939526854796	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.683876754281	We reduced violent crime to 30-year lows.
0.0	0.181554857302	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.
0.0	0.830226892848	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.197337400791	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.0369706473024	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.191473614543	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.0790376614315	... (inaudible) opening statement.
0.0	0.0630708696487	We need a collaborative approach.
0.0	0.191080355492	Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.
1.0	0.94147948589	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.406351757941	And if they have to be in the Middle East for 20 or 30 years no problem.
0.0	0.0321513739459	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.315223239926	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.314223644706	Run the company kids, have a good time.
1.0	0.526913420315	It's never below zero.
0.0	0.455588858561	Now, this takes, David, 18 months to 24 months, two years.
0.0	0.114865609385	The Secretary's obviously right.
0.0	0.277051668947	As president, I will support law enforcement and we'll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community.
0.0	0.258257035998	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.331035742069	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.226940319487	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.290627097488	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.237245521042	So we need people -- I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.0715484834607	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.
0.0	0.0979911861403	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.0782774404785	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.2270246843	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.227880027007	Yes.
0.0	0.106010984506	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.
0.0	0.302801135504	And let me, by the way, take this moment to congratulate Hillary Clinton, who I thought not only did an outstanding job as our first lady, but redefined what that role could be.
0.0	0.40024257526	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.0637890717594	Let's have a Democratic Syria.
0.0	0.61508763322	Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems.
0.0	0.160215093458	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.134590808282	They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it."
0.0	0.11963233405	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.161725305872	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.183242747396	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.440859838386	Yes, I apologize.
0.0	0.159451259924	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.

0.0	0.317547639076	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.205453443835	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.150622034176	I...

0.0	0.301330228172	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.

0.0	0.397354029559	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.

0.0	0.89064145911	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.315584888442	One of your colleagues interviewed me.

0.0	0.134313697043	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.481803996925	And if our middle class makes more money, they spend more money, and our whole economy grows.

0.0	0.33400748145	The United States has, unfortunately, been victimized by terrorism going back decades.
0.0	0.17304373329	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.173664884589	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.34307053742	We both made the identical promises.
0.0	0.277160509441	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.120420587972	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
1.0	0.539892402457	You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small.
0.0	0.13945839276	You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.
0.0	0.270045692455	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.00982013845156	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
0.0	0.207399813387	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.177919225825	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.295598616437	It is enormously complicated.
0.0	0.288276652205	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0775162570861	...Chris...
0.0	0.295219845046	We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.466674440111	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.160474016684	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.884971655792	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.0534704407875	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.0779688657742	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.429079863258	I was for legalization.
0.0	0.0240235671213	And, look, there are profound differences...
0.0	0.146775132672	And there are many ways of doing it.
0.0	0.101881350955	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.0409025450739	Please go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.144809092722	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.433298113572	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.293807265586	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.432884171839	Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
0.0	0.0453335557822	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.211959434963	You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.
0.0	0.0206463129471	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.2887512344	Our vets have been abandoned.
0.0	0.589525448657	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.144182252794	It's making...
0.0	0.319336600565	He's not arming the Kurds.
0.0	0.600301213409	Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.
0.0	0.328705412412	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.212113319202	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.136176034031	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.742259506227	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.174735644263	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.0932161734249	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.127977685048	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.187051220337	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.362886327542	The world has changed.
0.0	0.410197584379	... first of all...
0.0	0.579935196729	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.14223734503	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.0729179406234	We don't want to be Sweden.
1.0	0.299266873293	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.370683497181	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.149434363573	I'm tested.
0.0	0.333324318566	So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.
0.0	0.31908179978	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.0609950317249	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.2149480636	I think we all support it.
0.0	0.334300026573	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.568003970333	And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.
0.0	0.337900988879	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.419595442488	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.150960923303	I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history.
0.0	0.160833901359	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.225311600868	...
0.0	0.0789901371183	We saw a dictator overthrown.
0.0	0.606267323444	Just for the record.
0.0	0.0725647079114	But here's what's going to happen:
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.225311600868	That's what it is.
1.0	0.70439251587	And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent.
1.0	0.846901065334	And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent.
0.0	0.396474364611	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
0.0	0.934000359793	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.256515834948	So let's move toward what we should be doing as a nation and follow the values of our immigration history and begin to make it possible for them to come out of the shadows and to have a future that gives them a full chance of citizenship.
0.0	0.132869859381	You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.
0.0	0.205490484515	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.11669991727	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.685543759952	... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.
0.0	0.298442096334	You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that.
0.0	0.168255560171	Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen?
0.0	0.304066328824	If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.
0.0	0.861231355895	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.134425558021	No, John.
0.0	0.194535225349	If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country.
0.0	0.327677559704	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.128410915296	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.150471456891	Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.0547442355447	Dynamically.
1.0	0.999997383009	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.597125595345	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.430710313889	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.327823609689	If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
0.0	0.527553381363	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.607924910168	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.174966396265	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.286059663002	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.
0.0	0.0931728754331	We need more principle.
0.0	0.446131468797	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.259374682724	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.0769241505318	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.573918064594	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.0129956816833	I like it.
0.0	0.0804037152099	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.142091595012	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.456340492864	We have fought, as Democrats, for decades to get a health care plan.
0.0	0.304579256867	Maybe now we can get it moving again so that we can upgrade it so that it does include all the tools and everything in our arsenal that we can use to try to work with our allies and our friends, come up with better intelligence.
0.0	0.100548047217	Barack Obama wants to change America.
0.0	0.969375381013	She voted for it.
0.0	0.239993227363	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.258898585158	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.12796159772	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.16371595354	Many are in this building.
0.0	0.45480131317	I've spent my entire life, since I started as a young lawyer for the Children's Defense Fund, trying to figure out how we can even the odds for so many people in America, this great country of ours, who are behind, who don't have a chance.
0.0	0.505571960563	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
0.0	0.0508138981296	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.333530014573	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.466242398911	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.858425687639	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.0963037942445	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.450363937711	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.
0.0	0.279432697466	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.166469572156	We saw a Muslim brotherhood president installed, and then we saw him ousted and the army back.
0.0	0.0182489906449	OK.
0.0	0.229080549474	To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.
0.0	0.0719316416742	When I'm president, that will change.
0.0	0.293119277529	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.199941491761	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.367768035541	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.329854791551	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.221964260897	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.0994786111291	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.301966859469	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
0.0	0.0815763034978	There will be a process.
0.0	0.245606901834	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.306906900238	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.169050309759	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.153757170036	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.842712013068	The number of heroin deaths are growing very, very significantly.
0.0	0.127688479578	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.0431190057293	I don't want it.
0.0	0.338453810942	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.0126656069491	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.0425505609583	So nice, thank you very much.
0.0	0.579442326591	And he asked me to support that.
1.0	0.698192974801	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.319889231355	In terms of Wall Street, I respectfully disagree with you, madam secretary, in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth.
0.0	0.667503676094	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.5947172863	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.614616705503	And so people are still going to get health care, thankfully, in emergency rooms, in hospitals.
0.0	0.0826658871028	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.173137898723	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
1.0	0.845170651372	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.0825385907082	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.242503132519	It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.
0.0	0.340420043323	A lot of the rights that have been won over years, from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights, will be at risk.
0.0	0.233913769291	Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple.
0.0	0.153658856381	They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.
0.0	0.237120577088	Well, we did have a plan, and I think it's fair to say that of all of the Arab leaders, Gaddafi probably had more blood on his hands of Americans than anybody else.
0.0	0.225369655008	It's not true.
0.0	0.191091962475	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.675405753161	Close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole and...
0.0	0.194102983532	The NSA is another big issue.
0.0	0.402465386691	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
1.0	0.256311747896	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.247729944663	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.
0.0	0.0999059060074	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.225311600868	...
0.0	0.129466651753	Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president.
0.0	0.00949743705651	I think that is...
0.0	0.451188819112	When somebody is addicted and seeking help, they should not have to wait three, four months in order to get that help.
0.0	0.198598630511	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.235354662181	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.335571722089	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.0617969842888	So Hillary and I have a difference.
0.0	0.457750770807	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.385748949895	And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.
0.0	0.207620420319	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.419594237786	The simple fact is, we all have a record.
0.0	0.0970933812328	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.198281219343	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.132195376053	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.021530114798	Then I looked at Rubio.
0.0	0.0380868762433	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.378008164003	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.0714549777421	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.254242007975	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.
0.0	0.296692777739	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.108313545266	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.
0.0	0.39955412343	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.38097441649	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.225311600868	That has not been...
0.0	0.144011968946	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.204207261725	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.53950374779	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.177250907724	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.331283847186	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.344194879999	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.0129956816833	I like them.
0.0	0.132011238911	That's what I said.
0.0	0.202903156917	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.0690975682223	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.516910097341	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.209321600702	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.0595808135358	Right.
0.0	0.158691290887	But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.480025977796	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.04913754466	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.273231467711	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.0257716261387	I can't do it.
0.0	0.174707457424	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.
0.0	0.280708766906	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.219886017252	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.165259933255	And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
0.0	0.534440269827	I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.
0.0	0.383132200752	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.034929808357	That's crony capitalism.
0.0	0.10941107267	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.368486040235	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.114844510262	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.106665292522	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.203536333089	They will not bring us -- believe me -- to the promised land.
0.0	0.186732121883	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.271782647386	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.0814435036472	And you have to really work hard at it.
0.0	0.155315400454	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.224908476273	Let's reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.31237739846	Our country is in crisis.
0.0	0.0371378507012	Does my family like me?
0.0	0.515717317054	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.348703235717	Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military.
0.0	0.00108268351422	But look...
0.0	0.633089996417	There was a minimum wage at the state level, and some places went higher.
0.0	0.0282881572935	We have to do something.
0.0	0.0104649912548	And there's a lot.
0.0	0.518589161161	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.414836254118	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
0.0	0.0851726706401	He is a good man.
0.0	0.229167154148	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.0950613903558	Yeah, but let me respond...
0.0	0.371187659021	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.220401623817	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.120149171214	We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game.
0.0	0.113596777657	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.723980109914	I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.
0.0	0.317911939306	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.738844315972	Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.
0.0	0.564811520009	But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance.
0.0	0.0962624726438	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.197207129777	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.185337890448	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.253043446895	We saw what happened in Egypt.
0.0	0.202131499177	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.0912569380906	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.128584080506	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.342998305397	Kathie, this was not merely theory in Maryland.
0.0	0.757821226766	Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.
1.0	0.218015739797	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.0509761119761	We did a lot to help.
0.0	0.238318042295	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.110961912521	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
0.0	0.107669517162	But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college.
0.0	0.132276725736	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.0576147950034	That is an egregious act.
0.0	0.165738263697	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.306208760792	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.432931972326	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.219471553735	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.431470951863	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.112546182221	I've done it.
0.0	0.195948325967	In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.0552522867167	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.643202604516	I am proud that I was the first member of Congress to take Americans over the Canadian border to buy breast cancer drugs for one-tenth the price they were paying in the United States.
0.0	0.338638402617	First of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy, as you've indicated.
0.0	0.272832057688	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.0540758010285	It can happen.
0.0	0.234900761747	And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.
0.0	0.285311776261	Reinstating Glass- Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough.
0.0	0.941070493133	Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent.
0.0	0.218607790665	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.27319569082	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.560975250908	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.583823718103	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.039902549619	So I don't think...
0.0	0.358042015906	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.0144234404815	Yeah.
0.0	0.219766567681	But they're killing us economically.
0.0	0.444363207973	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.0677923913135	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.0403087871798	I'm proud of my family.
0.0	0.140582913335	I said, "Is he intelligent?"
1.0	0.981663857141	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.225951320251	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
1.0	0.957194964004	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.417370047467	I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
0.0	0.133664603388	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
0.0	0.213353781532	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.339631925445	And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence.
0.0	0.382800562415	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.21595748833	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
0.0	0.201953801672	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.520930066868	And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.394780291188	And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.
0.0	0.114293362194	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.16995786626	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.344110975771	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.207807953449	And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.
0.0	0.150952370882	The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.
1.0	0.482521615544	I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer.
0.0	0.298023569787	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.0614876435765	Wait a minute.
0.0	0.206039374551	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.256730511976	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
1.0	0.245310940052	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.400864357261	So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.
0.0	0.315093748909	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.
0.0	0.787672244502	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.130870714051	Our next president...
0.0	0.0795931443165	So there are people watching tonight in business.

0.0	0.167519506815	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.360730265042	That means education.

0.0	0.829922877859	So it's unfair to say in total...
0.0	0.194686874155	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.130398317399	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.521833415526	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.0601920318475	They are ripping us.

0.0	0.169732680404	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.219808385609	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.179211188511	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.156814227361	You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future.
0.0	0.0763180528872	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.359228531645	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.184326074439	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.256589088722	Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people.
0.0	0.225311600868	I have...
0.0	0.384207202834	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.187805823513	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.225311600868	No, no.
0.0	0.134126369994	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.0844372861677	I'll give you another example.
1.0	0.999982427592	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.0634388075583	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.335927495494	And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.
0.0	0.113032597534	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.328745169974	And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.
0.0	0.245752322692	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.304378921643	We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy.
0.0	0.160516922712	Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.
0.0	0.329998847674	And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.
0.0	0.256829833421	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.299700574131	I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to -- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.
0.0	0.517229245836	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.214391859696	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.93984522055	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.397787508317	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.29343460173	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.0912369560352	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.0894447178905	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.845425640885	He's been a negative force.
0.0	0.156291824714	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.351959547054	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.310559332047	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.807519370704	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.334308636953	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.35860064686	So I believe that over the next few years, not tomorrow, but over the next few years, we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.3039437273	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.399242781878	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.389797987518	Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.
0.0	0.208930669937	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.0484595028917	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.688743113999	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.
0.0	0.0122356420728	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.0606054848875	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.257564419036	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.756845406994	In fact, American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the National Institute of Health and that we then tested through the FDA.
0.0	0.636702500305	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.165340712764	I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.
0.0	0.273469993059	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.0469747916369	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.17871540004	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.131403443473	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.254088138992	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.444950620023	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.108503939512	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.

1.0	0.635252107473	Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion.
0.0	0.28228230724	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.0252370697291	You get a lot of them that are overrated.
0.0	0.586995884991	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.0595981191525	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.127497002405	We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.
0.0	0.802520081509	It's their money.
0.0	0.350040849385	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.189037147755	And one of his little boys said to him, "Dad, what happens if Donald Trump wins and we have to move out of our homes?"
0.0	0.0625858256881	But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
0.0	0.117929399731	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.0998761874882	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.0595808135358	That's right.
0.0	0.279358584162	And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process.
0.0	0.0530929445399	And they're all over the place.
0.0	0.151354008948	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.335990837627	Meanwhile, the rich get richer.
1.0	0.572967993377	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.310222872642	I believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation.
0.0	0.232731478934	I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.
0.0	0.295021216532	But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything.
0.0	0.0585455818307	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.175725080033	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.084667193888	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.132825467233	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.183105285459	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.342020861582	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.354406932097	Two points.
0.0	0.145704246304	And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...
0.0	0.0595808135358	Right.
0.0	0.590066338264	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.181527412417	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.177684879327	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.
0.0	0.198575625147	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.

0.0	0.0608048742579	My point is this.
0.0	0.274610545692	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.221934787436	You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes.
0.0	0.183523963199	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.725866851711	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.0561741198525	I have to tell you.
0.0	0.322898989132	All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.
0.0	0.0616883343541	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.251824845875	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.

0.0	0.357959378461	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.280516457125	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.20054749274	I guess the one I -- I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after Bin Laden.
0.0	0.274847022466	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.0469309372285	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.208750735348	I don't know and with all due respect to the secretary, Wall Street played by the rules?
0.0	0.100879983738	You don't serve us.
0.0	0.150425497006	Enough said.

0.0	0.117563359635	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.104470020651	Very valuable.
0.0	0.23860933681	We must keep America safe from this threat.
0.0	0.648575430196	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.3456794215	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.0708241682558	And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.
0.0	0.136538790047	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.563687037051	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.169484513318	It goes away.

0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.0806090438443	It really is important that we go forward on this.
0.0	0.692475410157	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.145531494507	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.5	They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.329549088466	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.929804098414	It costs me $3.
0.0	0.380830926257	It was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up.
1.0	0.986532410553	And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.
0.0	0.158050782211	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.0728036976864	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.473402834986	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.729364431303	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.164167398939	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.146526901492	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
0.0	0.407977801606	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.453506072069	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.0768845571061	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.277652636231	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.339415646409	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.36804972806	I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department.
1.0	0.585929715408	But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.
0.0	0.0356107770432	I don't like that.
0.0	0.300014633859	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.490869791321	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.0558069876859	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.0616883343541	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.111445179577	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
0.0	0.0498656432599	Well, thank you.
0.0	0.303031038099	Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them.
0.0	0.187540412324	And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said.
1.0	0.283822653536	We passed it after 9/11.
0.0	0.29579242612	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.
0.0	0.315439748291	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.116398064034	I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...
0.0	0.184700581683	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.217036809305	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.337200256012	They all want me to support them.
0.0	0.0477419852584	We have losers.
0.0	0.0126652840822	Creativity.
0.0	0.202950077314	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.123691834899	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.0878734051974	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.229608741649	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.360283813401	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.206201325326	As governor, we continued to work together.
0.0	0.172786490675	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.0700882121922	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
0.0	0.616626657571	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.0989576076004	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.122126707992	Well, there are so many, I don't know where to start.
0.0	0.36725864291	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.318453324948	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.136740787919	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.443021939026	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.800269482856	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.196901685947	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.370415064082	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.380412691624	ISIS, now, is the major priority.
0.0	0.251982288619	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.344680882376	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.301397308121	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.273178110279	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.385052045431	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.332305896598	This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.
0.0	0.174234988348	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.147137035515	And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous.
0.0	0.432190495628	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.62222516193	Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico.
0.0	0.169915341739	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.214949499301	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.38159975931	And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.
0.0	0.277606720241	I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.545069485855	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
0.0	0.102813598085	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.152260295937	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.17506644486	And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college.
0.0	0.0563285469144	Our president doesn't have a clue.
0.0	0.116703218042	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.345696979529	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.165426920673	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.706287439671	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.202536946636	I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out.
0.0	0.288686068751	Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground.
0.0	0.648865162253	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.12114875712	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.636563103848	We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
1.0	0.964908923492	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.3109368039	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.225311600868	...
0.0	0.0863381502214	I'd suggest people take a look at it.
0.0	0.308103646199	And so, you go the extra mile.
0.0	0.0887148448378	Lehman Brothers was not a big bank.

0.0	0.0973658701246	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.370687997857	Can I share this quick story?

0.0	0.177817976348	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.092625784588	And he is a proud American Muslim.
0.0	0.385345336647	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.549981087914	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.

1.0	0.981198213225	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
0.0	0.146005069019	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.150035720075	Here's the bottom line.

0.0	0.0556823443455	Well, I did.
0.0	0.390011085568	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.0801439783011	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.309225165651	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.151553893731	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.

0.0	0.0422479116993	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.225577436456	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.243354709339	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.115646977908	Both served.
0.0	0.414483399662	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.178030689853	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.373528464153	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.
0.0	0.188929475479	One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together.
0.0	0.194790045792	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
0.0	0.241072234001	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.480085364735	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?

0.0	0.126761074444	I'm happy to answer the question...
1.0	0.21277029332	We owe Japan more than that.
0.0	0.37921584746	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?

0.0	0.413623165254	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.202202123587	His first election and his re-election.

0.0	0.19283799583	I never said that.
0.0	0.369776142022	My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves.
0.0	0.0618105270324	You're right.
0.0	0.10436566348	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.
0.0	0.0730397840173	John, I think somewhere between...

0.0	0.349336041753	The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign.
0.0	0.0903811789787	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.535514939127	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.0473321594704	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.385035588574	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.409467658308	I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.
0.0	0.71282526448	And universities.

0.0	0.155381415417	We'll be filing it right on time.
0.0	0.0309480746776	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.220964994048	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.462515531101	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.233885804319	You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
1.0	0.939083848014	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.865900447973	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.286145166679	Well, we're going to have to redo the way the prescription drug industry does business.
0.0	0.342978883118	I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out.
0.0	0.0848952480763	It is not tough talk.
0.0	0.139348929905	I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.
0.0	0.5	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.185251341101	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.117573200958	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.
0.0	0.270031084249	We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.
0.0	0.162079979385	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.318792894654	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.066150404856	Let me...
0.0	0.25388804673	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.
0.0	0.29290267029	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.152861965049	Who do you know will defend life, marriage and religious liberty?
0.0	0.318366203647	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
0.0	0.205065278748	Those are all really positive developments.
0.0	0.64652937557	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.071927810833	You just can't do it.
0.0	0.291571011737	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.219814192421	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.0519433732146	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.517286209195	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.455309276358	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.0280995262239	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.245556247742	Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle."
0.0	0.406326809622	It was the most highly sought after -- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
0.0	0.0958304263968	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.190456465041	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.226864893251	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.435629790541	We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents.
0.0	0.127136874745	We were attacked from Afghanistan.
0.0	0.362795575089	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.381489356514	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.0780608481533	And it's an honor to have everybody here.
0.0	0.221491978311	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.46147404235	The Libyans turned out for one of the most successful, fairest elections that any Arab country has had.
0.0	0.25543689877	And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals -- the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
0.0	0.421438797127	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.557239418033	I also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees.
0.0	0.227233575877	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
1.0	0.99999204996	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.5	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.141969694303	I think that what we're facing with ISIS is especially complicated.
0.0	0.0619366297508	Don't know that.
1.0	0.275886687652	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.576258885868	And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity.
0.0	0.117320489257	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
1.0	0.974246216585	In 1988, just to set the record straight governor, I ran for the U.S. House.
0.0	0.153399745925	And I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern.
0.0	0.758895772132	Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts.
0.0	0.399588804606	Again, with all do respect to Secretary Clinton...
0.0	0.768553354611	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.296807091895	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy.
0.0	0.444041352335	But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone.
0.0	0.289249363919	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.29531598803	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.251898541496	Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC.
1.0	0.956827551235	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
0.0	0.20740153814	And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in.
0.0	0.914125603098	Trillions of dollars have gone from the middle class and working families to the top one-tenth of one percent who have doubled the percentage of wealth they now own.
0.0	0.0419108270076	What about hydroelectric power?
0.0	0.159619571669	But it's a lot safer.
1.0	0.594440859682	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.383880416336	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.259214577909	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.349487004039	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.294446260405	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.114303284359	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.234603473312	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.280611579666	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.0728384315262	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.203332063664	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.345078142357	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.354764535649	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.57593438285	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.259519289619	Saudi Arabia without us is gone.
0.0	0.817202164141	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.0283973121916	We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
0.0	0.830451942468	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.138572689602	I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen.
0.0	0.264480309169	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.416823404169	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.
0.0	0.10505693213	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.225311600868	Megyn?
0.0	0.628580984555	We have people that have no incentive to work.
0.0	0.096127430913	We say "we're gonna protect."
0.0	0.360502282728	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.608736241758	I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money.
0.0	0.299155954857	People were shocked, Trump got it.
0.0	0.139572545938	They're a scam.
0.0	0.294332339525	Why do -- why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major -- the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?
0.0	0.275706194264	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.292445964936	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.559006864793	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.141170273418	We need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table.
0.0	0.290226326252	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.125376275111	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.32766853048	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.336725797061	If we are not successful, if we continue the same old, same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big-money interests, nothing changes.
0.0	0.287598248113	Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.
0.0	0.438747969124	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.186048072468	We talked about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.192681648561	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.546330854268	And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.
0.0	0.166602050227	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.0499892316462	They'll all come back.

0.0	0.520944180697	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.221511059496	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.

0.0	0.152526135285	ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.
0.0	0.0357018885563	Good evening.
0.0	0.134066330474	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.367008343599	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.0835242427131	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.358160707173	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.329278117747	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.268783358529	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.249055908224	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.246869979961	And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.
0.0	0.353227695492	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.0892772363905	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.346206652712	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.121613974689	But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.
0.0	0.187253646351	We actually took action to do these things and as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.72870996033	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.798246825344	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.124780785492	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.1534715485	We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists.
0.0	0.181995185411	You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.
0.0	0.392240574105	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.0309039541475	They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
0.0	0.0577124698012	We need security.
0.0	0.395417350011	So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years -- you know, we're at $8 trillion now.
0.0	0.198565153718	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.824041133922	If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.
0.0	0.242617775966	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.189847298097	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.263411586926	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.0323137080829	But they're not good.
0.0	0.186443335143	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.0517792916527	They throw down asphalt, and they throw.
0.0	0.209931132204	Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.
0.0	0.519135500801	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.0531391351203	We have problems with Russia.
0.0	0.0994713557355	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
0.0	0.245398340727	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.048155958429	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.00949743705651	Think about it.
0.0	0.343576699032	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.360019220724	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.0828059915621	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.367008343599	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.130976214278	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.252817521664	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.923077739955	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.248461228101	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.29440606174	And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq.
0.0	0.13471374424	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.372035950737	Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.
0.0	0.0658668365378	I waited and I got the scars to show for it.
0.0	0.194168231457	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.699093124663	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.00551202621009	It's nice.
0.0	0.250139400071	I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that's what Iowans like to do.
1.0	0.221023026878	A lot of people up there can't get jobs.
0.0	0.0556823443455	... Well, no, no.
0.0	0.399236322079	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
1.0	0.0862639208142	Don't believe the 5.6.
0.0	0.427063096358	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.0987781672369	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.303681019524	And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.
0.0	0.0930915440225	He was young.
0.0	0.0721708357866	That was a terrible mistake.
0.0	0.395942743814	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.125252886596	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.25270316945	You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country.
1.0	0.9482111724	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.263512028859	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.810874504136	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.189490902355	It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.
0.0	0.0520757135631	Syria is a mess.
0.0	0.073526733421	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.267936988153	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.219364477775	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.370492303859	I met recently with some members of the Chaldean Christian communities and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months.
0.0	0.896384684269	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.320393756478	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.164254489731	That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them.
0.0	0.173776420731	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.363185987445	As Americans, we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet, but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies, to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability.
0.0	0.160006849118	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.280734617478	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.0889688075979	Let it be for everybody.
0.0	0.19042492068	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.19455148411	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.14523791736	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.065748504562	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
1.0	0.331119066302	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.511895717237	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.27033965297	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.110207368231	I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible.
0.0	0.0616883343541	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.364953319564	We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS, which is a danger to us as well as the region... SANDERS (?
0.0	0.106993153848	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.241565091962	I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures.
0.0	0.649703817002	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.164346496283	Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.
1.0	0.956283064105	We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.
0.0	0.549343391831	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.279513106843	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
1.0	0.988868653584	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.337910689484	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.468769073406	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.111386311332	We need to figure this out together.
0.0	0.274012121954	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.0979606458016	Whoever heard of this?
0.0	0.289779490745	We used to have victories, but we don't have them.
0.0	0.30816277606	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.126625341768	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.0822632290921	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.0939910674596	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.404880342711	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.0444446362786	No, I think they won't.
0.0	0.217195572224	We have people that aren't smart.
0.0	0.0102534837513	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.358180562105	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.344796535647	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.170246476622	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.14684909855	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.271623550084	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.44718719	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.354508797558	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.600106360745	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.116146345971	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.195401258277	You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?
0.0	0.187540412324	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.40222952037	But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
0.0	0.191891532944	There are a lot of factors involved in that.
0.0	0.164287481853	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.245912252959	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.178077349231	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.0763530472222	He said, "You know, I make great product."
0.0	0.726310870717	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.174097455178	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.406003892181	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.770000933976	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.628737944435	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.725574604735	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.174234988348	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.225311600868	What do we do?
0.0	0.10703750269	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.431914301046	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.0089963712297	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.102742522785	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.111446017979	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.141245855329	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.121415043103	There are hundreds of things like that.
0.0	0.240627232045	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.363482865919	I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.
0.0	0.243090960311	But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.0089963712297	It is a disaster.
0.0	0.0893610494333	I'm the only person...
0.0	0.292260265548	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.155353052154	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.273345324548	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.129951856909	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.
0.0	0.176043346831	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.404619329421	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.211960103917	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.222410686595	And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country.
0.0	0.797518052224	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.474844154334	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.123165837042	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
1.0	0.935238706458	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.221947951027	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.440883363008	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.152720999952	But actually I am.
0.0	0.126449075537	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.031993789026	I think he is right.
0.0	0.13708801371	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.225311600868	She did.
0.0	0.23099249244	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.223373467614	This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along.
0.0	0.0887792910629	Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.
0.0	0.647886450566	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.145018190336	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.309427302073	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.522841076745	And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.
0.0	0.130764723472	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.864626227054	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.25249289796	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.283719316704	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.322595945539	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.0648947499075	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
0.0	0.235884337608	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.125970959909	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.
0.0	0.15361711897	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.0417435435742	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.22606699098	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.31019957434	That can be done without profiling people.
0.0	0.686438001254	The number of women --
0.0	0.203715771035	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.115631141873	We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.
1.0	0.478539486433	They're bringing drugs.
0.0	0.167338032193	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.892455718367	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.254912276396	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
0.0	0.225311600868	Do it.
0.0	0.0441899434558	You want to know what carpet bombing is?
0.0	0.217780750321	And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them.
0.0	0.014679347405	He sure did.
0.0	0.354207216831	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
1.0	0.661722225702	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.240709305486	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.178186606844	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.

0.0	0.0821480850419	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
0.0	0.257130270302	Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country.
0.0	0.0353658672516	That's the difference.
0.0	0.225311600868	No, I have not.
0.0	0.302779389199	The Iranians getting more of a presence in Syria, linking with Hezbollah, their proxy in Lebanon, would threaten Israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with Assad's future.
0.0	0.0466211251586	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.

0.0	0.0294578164508	Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.233141006404	But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
0.0	0.5	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.301323869324	They're going to come in legally.

0.0	0.0766111203239	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.112643165771	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.0348945004814	A step forward.
0.0	0.391299977378	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.145965842861	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.186972981173	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
0.0	0.399760063265	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.564301539273	And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.
0.0	0.31947578451	For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check.

0.0	0.210739724621	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.0970502709297	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.759812660758	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.377263842138	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.406576506562	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.230599926393	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.

0.0	0.891725431954	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.0642848395781	I think it's a two-pronged issue.
0.0	0.225311600868	No.
0.0	0.532290616297	You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.

0.0	0.101675059894	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...

0.0	0.0823498211776	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.28478851268	But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it.
0.0	0.120436717088	It's real estate.
0.0	0.5	But Secretary Clinton is wrong.
0.0	0.225381133365	Bill.
0.0	0.35792972312	And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion, this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us, and that we stand with them as they have stood with us.
0.0	0.165468812173	That is not protected religious belief.

0.0	0.140070744154	Well, thanks for having me.
0.0	0.598318732404	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.

0.0	0.178021079934	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.101077859368	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.255976955591	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.262121879348	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
0.0	0.441491241957	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.41307146883	But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.
0.0	0.337947177847	I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.618531161528	This was a question on entitlements.

0.0	0.587853324015	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.0851155034769	Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire.

0.0	0.0787148562655	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.255921446352	I know that because I buy the product."
0.0	0.208484172373	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.330422984233	My heart, like all of us in this room, John, and all the people across our country, my hearts go out to the people of France in this moment of loss.

0.0	0.546551739246	Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server.

0.0	0.453466589748	It's virtually useless.

0.0	0.0439702018929	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.524652790257	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.

0.0	0.311802019411	I think we need major reform in the military, making it more cost effective, but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us.

0.0	0.13615985383	I don't think anyone has a magical solution.
0.0	0.146624900388	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.283879240986	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."

0.0	0.202232679914	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.172374738805	And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.
0.0	0.358298407528	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.

0.0	0.1556805694	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
0.0	0.457180329722	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.132885204522	And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it.
0.0	0.346146774462	Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.

0.0	0.563934927746	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.363761239777	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.106951480951	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.

0.0	0.254015570921	I've a bill to fix Social Security.

0.0	0.112861304829	I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.255775806521	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
1.0	0.470431634798	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.264256223086	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.

0.0	0.350277266132	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.321374979619	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.736425190712	My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.458053966153	There's no nation on earth that comes close to that number.

0.0	0.597170685328	I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment.
0.0	0.0629830491891	You want to know why things don't get done in Washington?
0.0	0.114466668384	We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.
0.0	0.101033487091	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.

0.0	0.0706147648759	And Martha...
0.0	0.820261445765	Why is it that we are spending per capita far, far more than Canada, which is 100 miles away from my door, that guarantees health care to all people?
0.0	0.210078357946	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.0474840886835	And I've been there.

0.0	0.227880027007	Yes.
0.0	0.359652448702	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.0725647079114	And here's what's going to happen.
0.0	0.304072544099	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.0439915337705	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.450602512011	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.350187169242	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.0402392067416	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.21334072929	And it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer.
0.0	0.384666759659	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.254025942696	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.0987332753565	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.0964531878487	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.907244399889	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.0601338597689	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.174723540714	Now, it's very interesting.
0.0	0.295554397508	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.207408307544	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.42072074533	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.590535856416	But accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000.
0.0	0.218555145972	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.350851852441	They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.
0.0	0.276961452126	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.129692708465	And we can do it.
0.0	0.334405551095	And for my part, I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has.
0.0	0.231459922899	You know why three?
0.0	0.630115819753	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.00400905407677	So did you, Marco.
0.0	0.437398196689	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.172477666048	We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
0.0	0.553800119225	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.304273303367	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.176365744715	Give people a chance.
0.0	0.306461461107	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.153271086559	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.384059508474	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.175811182481	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.181479904894	Nobody can do that like me.
0.0	0.650704289766	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.696615916208	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.217868286418	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.175531438714	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.177102077206	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.367914115628	But those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort.
0.0	0.446557421569	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.152061252358	Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.
0.0	0.367768035541	We're up 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.167909833082	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.100399425924	In addition to that...
0.0	0.105440921824	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.131918293564	Mark my words.
0.0	0.420601625952	And now they are beating us economically.
0.0	0.121297441317	And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that.
0.0	0.779837405249	People have been paying it for years.
0.0	0.0788008171392	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.241252347061	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.549744694529	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.176832833459	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.225312812906	He's weak on immigration.
0.0	0.303335114465	We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it.
0.0	0.420163629085	I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place.
1.0	0.964880572167	Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.
0.0	0.276295411274	And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.
0.0	0.178949660299	We need to end minimal sentencing.
0.0	0.0619366297508	He didn't know.
0.0	0.342500437989	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.168405015643	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.259157351809	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.186053865202	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.132970650018	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.720028211052	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.206334636586	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.403166479784	I introduced...
0.0	0.448315287571	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.314766833364	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.42752192701	And in that capacity, I met with just an extraordinary group of people from World War II, from korea, vietnam, all of the wars.
0.0	0.246397428543	So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe.
0.0	0.222328422792	In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill, "Well I assume Hillary has told you about this."
1.0	0.999993150059	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.191972132877	No, I've never made a promise like that.
0.0	0.45979382633	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.244401648192	You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now -- it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run.
0.0	0.182532917002	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.
0.0	0.464293042122	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.771226758548	Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions?
0.0	0.776429593899	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.0727995396344	I know, Bret.
0.0	0.332636895819	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.154641080297	And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.
0.0	0.14318740473	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
0.0	0.253544652879	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.0862639208142	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.0971243965237	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.44274830024	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?
0.0	0.0927572671763	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.0696090756042	It's what they call it.
0.0	0.121187353542	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.551411393516	And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.
0.0	0.225943130822	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.0441774973009	And you know what?
0.0	0.228385292304	We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.
0.0	0.191601998066	to save a company.
0.0	0.335300661895	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.0894429310641	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.528568160416	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.231001159149	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.190897465308	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.245332063629	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.913904763925	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.090663845991	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.0541353505033	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.387352694492	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.148154091499	And who's compromised and who is principled.
0.0	0.272931737356	He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing?
0.0	0.313761654264	Ask Boeing.
0.0	0.183826433575	So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.
0.0	0.20572284051	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.0310308213958	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.448902275556	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.397914862634	But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that.
0.0	0.467712448021	You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon.
0.0	0.134535474465	I'm going to support you, and I think that is absolutely appropriate.
0.0	0.225311600868	Not at all.
0.0	0.309153085362	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.187599900635	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.390646490768	That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.
0.0	0.378662282584	Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone.
0.0	0.19380759544	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.415462888185	When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.
0.0	0.5	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.298505363853	But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks."
0.0	0.520746991979	We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate.
0.0	0.20744559609	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
0.0	0.184793763593	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.344360411007	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.0964844949033	And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are.
0.0	0.115821929781	We also have to build a coalition at home.
0.0	0.409570607828	Support community banks and credit unions.
0.0	0.17801662486	Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, "Sorry, fellas.
0.0	0.138153886651	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.225311600868	No.
0.0	0.451508142356	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.251942003786	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.165556798881	I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace.
0.0	0.26786862172	That is a pledge that I'm making.
1.0	0.446546100223	2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.
0.0	0.291817081643	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.155023571002	It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee.
1.0	0.999999928933	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.277638594068	No interest," because I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.121275203616	We got nothing but problems.
0.0	0.183731667576	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.367485253751	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.248255425549	Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.
0.0	0.250136876042	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.105025213466	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.
0.0	0.306292064938	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.156146755281	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.33974170343	And in 19 -- and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said -- and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever.
0.0	0.273661508063	But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says.
0.0	0.754588046753	There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction.
0.0	0.272295102045	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.702505174616	I hire people, they do a Web site.
0.0	0.706385749732	They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.
0.0	0.0451479129429	I think there is a consensus.
0.0	0.394565610755	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.134402034238	We've got the consensus, what we're lacking is political leadership...
0.0	0.225311600868	No.
0.0	0.0355122642178	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.354659938789	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.225311600868	No.
0.0	0.331822996323	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.175242809317	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.187068136615	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.373144739485	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.303855123406	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.304932923914	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.53033779722	They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
0.0	0.0938246217252	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.148924418224	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.390345944391	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.135909032598	Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face.
0.0	0.0957392285949	I have a problem with that, Martha.
0.0	0.454936078889	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.146362244786	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.0858598463279	But I was born here.
0.0	0.133960088726	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.250888792358	... and I think -- you know, Governor -- Jeb, you -- the attack that -- the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS.
0.0	0.169344195464	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.293777811127	There's never going do be perfect bill.
0.0	0.773645585687	Yes, well, roughly.
0.0	0.828245870492	I released 34 years of tax returns...
0.0	0.167936499495	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.46750600194	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.
0.0	0.675823089622	We have people that are morally corrupt.
0.0	0.247474783334	And the world, no doubt is a better place without him.
0.0	0.134438394006	... Chris, keep it coming...
0.0	0.0711025697683	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
0.0	0.334901813484	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.220560801506	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.181970471528	Let's put the gun makers and sellers on notice that they're not going to get away with it.
0.0	0.267477038339	That's what I understand is the request from the international...
0.0	0.138891421772	By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job.
0.0	0.104834815814	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.0790517656388	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.0841843623425	I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.282875578081	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.611402510192	And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.
1.0	0.627277091184	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.0355796825965	They don't have a clue.
0.0	0.0758690383172	I kind of miss Donald Trump.
0.0	0.373199554844	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.104115668783	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.412927036009	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.395335894853	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.26078106192	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.177186671441	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.360862930536	If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship.
0.0	0.275749629553	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.134357113977	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.242727464351	As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election.
0.0	0.378224832661	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.653797099033	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.
0.0	0.409614118078	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.0157385022059	I agree with them.
0.0	0.145336845174	That can be done.
0.0	0.118066785621	All of these are very difficult issues.
0.0	0.0833262482757	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.356367338127	It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control.
0.0	0.099041646318	I've laid out...
0.0	0.219348405852	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.0888859098779	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.31192184327	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.358336971401	People came back from Iraq and Afghanistan without legs, without arms.
0.0	0.230617362029	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.269135689961	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.816399739386	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.0603205813275	But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.
1.0	0.994229549796	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.0806062134203	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.158934803615	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.809370579286	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.156157376415	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.176166983847	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.212192960337	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.23491894903	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.389021106594	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.237975099575	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.459317663982	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.689101773055	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
0.0	0.267557236068	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.367879267758	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.0954607077478	Well, I just want to quickly add...
0.0	0.131978793408	Absolutely.
0.0	0.2921543397	They're sending us not the right people.
0.0	0.416770746777	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.109083323659	When did we beat Japan at anything?
0.0	0.779583891632	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.184408672644	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
0.0	0.62071948891	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.306642125069	More importantly, I want kids in Burlington, Vermont, or Baltimore, Maryland, who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade, who don't have a lot of money, whose parents -- like my parents -- may never have gone to college.
0.0	0.0716402428492	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.435364986588	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.123925394809	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.361045374059	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.411267691831	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.119949248007	But I would say this to you, Bret.
0.0	0.353015125062	Chris I was mentioned in that question.
0.0	0.202979996021	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
1.0	0.40897075513	Twenty-one mass shootings, including one last weekend in Des Moins where three were murdered.
0.0	0.0326123943599	As a Catholic, that's what I want to do.
0.0	0.119043689188	Everybody thought it was a done deal.
0.0	0.063371373906	What a brilliant idea that would be.
0.0	0.196951960218	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.
1.0	0.54585309873	$10.10 was all I could get the state to do by the time I left in my last year.

0.0	0.177098851887	I do agree that in particular, Turkey and the Gulf nations have got to make up their minds.
0.0	0.38537848916	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.0412913305221	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.163308815389	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.154175917576	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.
0.0	0.240086453042	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.227702306479	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.275885150453	The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...
0.0	0.38178158958	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
0.0	0.257774160701	Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...
0.0	0.0969664708207	): Secretary...
0.0	0.131637341714	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
0.0	0.210065865347	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.095574565429	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.257754977616	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.142596254151	And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage.
0.0	0.0365938153526	Well, sure.
0.0	0.11679600256	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.38686160699	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.587115099572	We expand Medicare to all people.
0.0	0.155437961092	Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question.

0.0	0.241205723187	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.397657514459	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.225888483148	You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster.
0.0	0.585651992336	What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people.
0.0	0.132458007109	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
1.0	0.418580968296	But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works.
0.0	0.37746115998	I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.
0.0	0.0615568054031	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.469841942475	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.55592911962	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.0167668591686	I think you're --
0.0	0.170718481486	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.555238403201	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.0955110219464	So I've watched the politicians.
0.0	0.212512396208	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.972718870415	Do the $12 and you would index it.
0.0	0.388564370069	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.351346849754	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.625281157456	Of course not.
0.0	0.0981817470641	There won't be any -- you can get it.
0.0	0.0482030627214	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.315563771086	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.598913045352	But bottom line now, is in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or her family.
0.0	0.163505439213	I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
0.0	0.646545258845	Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.
0.0	0.351788469828	At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically.
0.0	0.376250621088	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.0948077101528	That's what the political revolution is about.
0.0	0.490107151862	I watched the video of Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.858845969821	We have artificially low interest rates.
0.0	0.21229424703	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.

0.0	0.4705996217	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.185422540017	But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country.
0.0	0.517468021984	It is not because of the tax writeoff.
0.0	0.0348945004814	It is a step forward.
0.0	0.18514706272	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.219775798173	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.225591074833	Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees.
0.0	0.0852643894352	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.214062505888	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.0944525905785	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.461484862559	And now since this happened" -- it's up in the prison area -- "my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns.
0.0	0.159634071839	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.152953380596	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.315113899057	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.131313492814	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.372107881712	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.297923268678	Parents, and sons, and daughters and family members, and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them, we must remember this, that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century.
0.0	0.0504595721301	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.

0.0	0.450384055015	... Chris, your questions that you...
0.0	0.332105025522	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.389080710735	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.
0.0	0.627950862923	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.387022720046	The young officer who was killed responding to the Planned Parenthood murders.
0.0	0.0167456410125	No, I love them.

0.0	0.293140802273	Make ourselves stronger at home, but also our role in the world, yes, is also to confront evil when it rises.
0.0	0.552150779649	And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.
0.0	0.134168047564	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.

0.0	0.134425558021	John.
0.0	0.253812676042	You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.
0.0	0.384273281256	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.

0.0	0.356640284402	Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform.
0.0	0.43156520537	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.078049460376	That will be my mission as president.

0.0	0.335910847025	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.

0.0	0.443750746361	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.280794824427	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.114160362185	That's not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.
0.0	0.40900678289	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.412851823124	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.394061882458	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.225311600868	And here's why.
0.0	0.172266919325	He's wrong.
0.0	0.242396325389	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.813038944131	That is why I support a $12 national federal minimum wage.
0.0	0.321565677602	Their family is waiting for them.

0.0	0.414500626453	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.381060081073	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.17934614648	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.266984178273	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.393907641061	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.194243881018	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.304644584916	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.
0.0	0.173776327859	Predominantly African-American and Hispanic.
0.0	0.00409831337456	Thank you.
0.0	0.657031726653	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
1.0	0.771252907629	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.0507115584499	Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem.
0.0	0.162948063659	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.125749683759	We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation.
0.0	0.0507123384702	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.447681691288	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.247696260436	We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear.
0.0	0.120508885899	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.0671772524039	How are we gonna -- how are we gonna go back and make it great again?
0.0	0.471528526713	We should make women third-class citizens, that we should allow children to be sexually assaulted, that they are a danger to modern society.
0.0	0.193071536672	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.181341012898	You learn to create feedback mechanisms.
0.0	0.0223517325301	We serve you.
0.0	0.142549156519	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.104743097871	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.420705119256	And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.
0.0	0.225369655008	That's true.
1.0	0.999982527095	In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.
0.0	0.538655842099	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.188986030947	We're running.
0.0	0.277931540196	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.214276526504	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.372449336535	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.109456173354	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.298778778145	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.286201385864	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.215194857646	We bailed out Wall Street.
0.0	0.275827754059	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.372367470059	But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.
0.0	0.347712727142	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.0809352876261	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
0.0	0.131978793408	Absolutely.
0.0	0.12073589825	And, I will tell you, I love my life.
0.0	0.448424609737	We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.
0.0	0.494895812805	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.166922156375	I changed that.
0.0	0.591816774988	... and 85 percent of gun owners agree.
0.0	0.268560027856	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.238815136589	They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea.
0.0	0.626365704604	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.403882929898	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.147572342261	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.091756438559	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.166103753429	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.0651694717872	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.057603593543	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.287028003665	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.
0.0	0.117691550514	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.418162953425	I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor, I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very, very powerful and most important of all jobs in the United States, the president, whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country.
0.0	0.0638359998063	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.0441774973009	You know why?
0.0	0.39427870836	The administration originally said 10.
0.0	0.427242095235	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
0.0	0.0185215524837	They're great.
0.0	0.115048101797	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.389829585434	We shouldn't have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time.
0.0	0.434845688264	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.202000641517	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
1.0	0.97588033385	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.0641883590475	I agree completely.
1.0	0.963314042558	It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate.
0.0	0.349000161801	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.648258580718	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.387495309759	In the 1980s, it was in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Reagan's administration, and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel, and others were murdered.
0.0	0.0811728332832	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.266644115549	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.195575603092	Terrorism in this country scares everyone.
0.0	0.214580037506	Is creating much deeper, closer relations and, yes, coalitions within our own country.
0.0	0.691703222572	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
0.0	0.212330021258	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...
0.0	0.269817456126	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.0723391318894	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.486826497092	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.235671840978	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.138501193295	He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments.
0.0	0.672965326694	That's what I said to my own public health people.
0.0	0.280930189468	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.318483984629	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.198862611603	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
1.0	0.951249580101	There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign.
0.0	0.628443317524	What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security, through the State Department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening.
0.0	0.337485205038	That's the right of people.
0.0	0.464616374482	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.20775648009	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.0207062492423	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.198324344815	And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.
0.0	0.209334385579	When you come back to me, I'll share that story.
0.0	0.0286956551185	We did our own rallies.
1.0	0.19042998976	When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.253896259792	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.578430133782	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.0631516648254	We've got nothing.
0.0	0.0332579367604	We need to define the enemy.
0.0	0.206494223925	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.230464570584	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.
0.0	0.396364908313	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.46631423704	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.364751322931	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.156763810173	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.267900410452	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.00949743705651	They think they are.
0.0	0.708115262432	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.198849456707	Well, this whole issue concerns me.
0.0	0.170117582909	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.117586850964	Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.
0.0	0.844306525598	I also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down.
0.0	0.391537918036	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.248832534472	But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.
0.0	0.625520421865	Our staff found information on our computers from the Clinton campaign.
0.0	0.29052409733	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.527731844786	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.380768981724	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
1.0	0.999998494379	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.284785176934	And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.
0.0	0.437087141279	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.0801703629952	I don't need the rhetoric.
0.0	0.432692078615	First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, "they cannot have it all."
0.0	0.0752253324647	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.0906071995511	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.0989364336895	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.
0.0	0.269349320279	Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
0.0	0.33736264179	What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS.
1.0	0.983677994959	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.249327203495	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.130348709661	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.534843312798	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.295172243829	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.417599140996	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.366609034211	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
0.0	0.5	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.034929808357	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.261656882242	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.0620273191725	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.248805973465	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.103072087797	It ain't complicated.
0.0	0.5	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.338695511019	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.203384120202	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.
